In The Cursed Heart, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll follow the story of an ancient pirate with a forbidden passion. The pirate was cursed and ultimately died, his soul never truly finding rest without the accompaniment of his long-lost love. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll travel throughout the Caribbean to some dimly lit locals as you try to lift the curse and discover more about this ghostly pirate along the way.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamezebo.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/medium/games/8303/Screenshot003.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamezebo.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/medium/games/8303/Screenshot003.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamezebo.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/medium/games/8303/Screenshot007.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamezebo.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/medium/games/8303/Screenshot007.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamezebo.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/medium/games/8303/Screenshot010.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamezebo.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/medium/games/8303/Screenshot010.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWhile you can complete The Cursed Heart in traditional hidden object game fashion, exploring the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 33 locations and (likely repeatedly) playing its 13 hidden object scenes, you can also switch to a Mahjong-style mini-game if the hidden object scenes just arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t doing it for you. Regardless of your method of choice, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll take items from hotspots and can use them elsewhere in the game, like in its 17 puzzles or mini-games.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5182d04d59a70419e9eecc656bfd6401640cf525","amp;dn":"Nightmares+from+the+Deep+-+The+Cursed+Heart+Collectors+Edition+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5182d04d59a70419e9eecc656bfd6401640cf525","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,130,208,77,89,167,4,25,233,238,204,101,107,253,100,1,100,12,245,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
