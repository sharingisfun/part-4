Make no mistake, this is the most direct route to orgasm for many women, and Diana Cage shows you how to not only excel at it but revel in \n\nit!\n\nMore than a guide to cunnilingus, Box Lunch is a clever, witty and informative guide to all types of sex. Cage also discusses anal sex, spanking, intercourse and even includes a \n\nfully illustrated chapter the best positions for sex, oral and otherwise. With her trademark naughty humor Cage takes you on a ride to the best sex you've ever had.\n\nFrom Library Journal\nBox Lunch is great: unashamed and unabashed. The personable Cage, who describes herself as a &quot;rug munching champ,&quot; comes off like your best friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s slightly older and way sexy \n\nsister. Dudes get plenty of unclinical instruction, plus euphemisms (polish the pearl, Egg McMuff, growling at the badger). Cage also reminds readers that other body parts, like \n\ntoes, can be just as erotic and sexy as the hoo hoo. Still, the emphasis remains on the, a-hem, main event: &quot;Lick a lady into oblivion, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to keep you on her \n\nmailing list for a long time to come.&quot; Lessons: big, looping circles; pressure; teasing; and figure eights. -Douglas Lord, Library Journal, 02/04/2010","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6936f01fdf24bc355d80db5040f85bb5ec925ca3","amp;dn":"Box+Lunch-+The+Layperson%27s+Guide+to+Cunnilingus+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6936f01fdf24bc355d80db5040f85bb5ec925ca3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,54,240,31,223,36,188,53,93,128,219,80,64,248,91,181,236,146,92,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
