That is all it is.  However, it can be very usefull.\n\nIf you live in a loud city, turn this on repeat and it will drown out all the other noise.\n\nWhat I used it for, and it worked quite well, was to help my newborn sleep. He would cry for no reason in the middle of the night. I would play this audio cd on repeat for hours and he would sleep ever so peacefully.  If you care to know why, the reason is this sound mimicks what they hear for 9 months in the womb. So it helps them feel more at home. Turn it up fairly loud btw. about as loud as the baby is crying.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a3c29b90b116bbc43f93f8df8c28d75f8272551","amp;dn":"White+Noise","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a3c29b90b116bbc43f93f8df8c28d75f8272551","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,60,41,185,11,17,107,188,67,249,63,141,248,194,141,117,248,39,37,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
