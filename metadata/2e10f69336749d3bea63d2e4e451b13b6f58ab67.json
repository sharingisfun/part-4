And to make this richly illustrated book even richer, each chapter invites the reader along for an interactive experience through the addition of removable facsimile documentsâ€”the evidence! It's a treasure trove for conspiracy buffs, a Griffin and Sabine for history lovers.\r\n\r\nAdapted from Decoded, Meltzerâ€™s hit show on the HISTORY network, History Decoded explores fascinating, unexplained questions. Is Fort Knox empty? Why was Hitler so intent on capturing the Roman â€œSpear of Destinyâ€? Whatâ€™s the government hiding in Area 51? Where did the Confederacyâ€™s $19 million in gold and silver go at the end of the Civil War? And did Lee Harvey Oswald really act alone? Meltzer sifts through the evidence; weighs competing theories;  separates what we know to be true with whatâ€™s stillâ€”and perhaps foreverâ€”unproved or unprovable; and in the end, decodes the mystery, arriving at the most likely solution. Along the way we meet Freemasons, Rosicrucians, Nazi propagandists, and the real DB Cooper.\r\n\r\nBound in at the beginning of each story is a custom-designed envelopeâ€”a faux 19th-century leather satchel, a U.S. government classified fileâ€”containing facsimiles of relevant evidence: John Wilkes Boothâ€™s alleged unsigned will, a map of the Vatican, Kennedyâ€™s death certificate. The whole is a riveting, interactive adventure through the compelling world of mysteries and conspiracies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e10f69336749d3bea63d2e4e451b13b6f58ab67","amp;dn":"Brad+Meltzer+-+History+Decoded+-+The+10+Greatest+Conspiracies+of","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e10f69336749d3bea63d2e4e451b13b6f58ab67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,16,246,147,54,116,157,59,234,99,210,228,228,81,177,59,111,88,171,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
