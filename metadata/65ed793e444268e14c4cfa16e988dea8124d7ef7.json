A legendary commander, the man who has saved his people time and time again, struggling to lead the fleet ever forward, fighting through every attack the enemy throws at them.\r\n\r\nA hidden world, a remote refuge prepared millennia ago, holding the promise of a new future - if the fleet can reach it and hold it against the Regent's relentless attacks.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Terrance Compton and his lost fleet battle their way forward, striving to reach the end of their great journey.
