We all do. We fear that the depression will never lift, the yelling will never stop, the pain will never leave. In the pits, surrounded by steep walls and aching reminders, we wonder: Will this gray sky ever brighten? This load ever lighten?\n\nIn&quot; You'll Get Through This,&quot; pastor and&quot; New York Times&quot; best-selling author, Max Lucado offers sweet assurance. &quot;Deliverance is to the Bible what jazz music is to Mardi Gras: bold, brassy, and everywhere.&quot; Max reminds readers God doesn't promise that getting through trials will be quick or painless. It wasn't for Joseph--tossed in a pit by his brothers, sold into slavery, wrongfully imprisoned, forgotten and dismissed--but his Old Testament story is in the Bible for this reason: to teach us to trust God to trump evil.\n\nWith the compassion of a pastor, the heart of a storyteller, and the joy of one who has seen what God can do, Max explores the story of Joseph and the truth of Genesis 50:20. What Satan intends for evil, God redeems for good.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31c50ba009211e6ea8740a5f50594dab19400cc2","amp;dn":"You%27ll+Get+Through+This+-+Max+Lucado.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31c50ba009211e6ea8740a5f50594dab19400cc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,197,11,160,9,33,30,110,168,116,10,95,80,89,77,171,25,64,12,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
