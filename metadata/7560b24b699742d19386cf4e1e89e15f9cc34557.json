For starters, consider the staggering depth and breadth of his repertoire (perhaps matched only by those of Bob Dylan and Ray Charles), embracing ancient folk tunes (&quot;Streets of Laredo&quot;), teen pop (&quot;Ballad of a Teenage Queen&quot;), mature contemporary rock (&quot;Highway Patrolman&quot;), gospel (&quot;Were You There When They Crucified My Lord&quot;), topical fare (&quot;Ballad of Ira Hayes&quot;), country standards (&quot;Time Changes Everything&quot;), novelties (&quot;One Piece at a Time&quot;), and more. \n\nThen there's the way his spare, spacious sound opens up to take in horns (&quot;Ring of Fire&quot;), strings (&quot;Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down&quot;), anything. The Legend includes seven previously unissued sides, most prominently &quot;It Takes One to Know Me,&quot; a stirring salute to his wife June.\n\nTracks:\n\n101  I Walk The Line\n102  There You Go\n103  Home Of The Blues\n104  Ballad Of A Teenage Queen\n105  Guess Things Happen That Way\n106  Ways Of A Woman In Love\n107  Don't Take Your Guns To Town\n108  Ring Of Fire [Single Version]\n109  The Matador\n110  Understand Your Man\n111  The Ballad Of Ira Hayes\n112  Orange Blossom Special\n113  One On The Right Is On The Left\n114  Rosanna's Going Wild\n115  Folsom Prison Blues [Live Version]\n116  Daddy Sang Bass\n117  A Boy Named Sue [Live Version]\n118  What Is Truth\n119  Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down\n120  Flesh And Blood\n121  Man In Black\n122  A Thing Called Love\n123  Kate\n124  Oney [Single Version]\n125  Any Old Wind That Blows\n126  One Piece At A Time [Single Version]\n127  [Ghost] Riders In The Sky\n201  Hey Porter\n202  Cry, Cry, Cry\n203  Luther Played The Boogie\n204  Get Rhythm\n205  Give My Love To Rose\n206  I Was There When It Happened\n207  Big River\n208  I Still Miss Someone\n209  Pickin' Time\n210  The Man On The Hill\n211  Five Feet High And Rising\n212  Tennessee Flat-Top Box\n213  I Got Stripes\n214  Troublesome Waters\n215  The Long Black Veil\n216  Dark As A Dungeon\n217  The Wall\n218  25 Minutes To Go\n219  Cocaine Blues [Live Version]\n220  Doin' My Time\n221  I Will Rock And Roll With You\n222  Without Love\n223  The Big Light\n224  Highway Patrolman\n225  I'm Never Gonna Roam Again\n226  When I'm Gray\n227  Forever Young\n301  The Wreck Of The Old 97\n302  Rock Island Line\n303  Goodnight Irene\n304  Goodbye, Little Darlin'\n305  Born To Lose\n306  Walking The Blues\n307  Frankie's Man, Johnny\n308  Delia's Gone\n309  In The Jailhouse Now\n310  Waiting For A Train\n311  Casey Jones\n312  The Legend Of John Henry's Hammer\n313  I've Been Working On The Railroad\n314  Sweet Betsy From Pike\n315  The Streets Of Laredo\n316  Bury Me Not On The Lone Prairie\n317  Down In The Valley\n318  Wabash Cannonball\n319  The Great Speckled Bird\n320  Wildwood Flower\n321  Cotton Fields [The Cotton Song]\n322  Pick A Bale O' Cotton\n323  Old Shep\n324  I'll Be All Smiles Tonight\n325  I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\n326  Time Changes Everything\n401  Keep On The Sunny Side [Ft.
