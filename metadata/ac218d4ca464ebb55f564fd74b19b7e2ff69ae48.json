The July '70 Mothers line-up featured Flo &amp; Eddie, George Duke, Ian Underwood, Aynsley Dunbar &amp; Jeff Simmons. FZ's vast Vault does not contain many full shows from this time period, so that alone makes this release a special one. The tapes were recorded to stereo reel-to-reel, but not without problems. Due to their historical relevance, we felt it was worth it, warts 'n all! Venue #3 does not disappoint","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac218d4ca464ebb55f564fd74b19b7e2ff69ae48","amp;dn":"Frank+Zappa+-+Road+Tapes%2C+Venue+3+%282016%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac218d4ca464ebb55f564fd74b19b7e2ff69ae48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,33,141,76,164,100,235,181,95,86,79,215,75,25,183,226,255,105,174,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
