There is never a safe moment in Lawrence's debut.&quot;\n-Robert Redick, author of The Red Wolf Conspiracy\n\n&quot;Dark and relentless, the Prince of Thorns will pull you under and drown you in story. A two in the morning page turner.&quot;\n-Robin Hobb, author of The Inheritance\n\n&quot;Vivid...smooth and compelling... gritty and full of wonder. This book is brilliant.&quot;\n-Galaxy Book Reviews\n\n&quot;Disturbing, Beautiful, Chaotic, Poetic, Haunting, Exhilarating.&quot;\n-Fantasy Faction\n\n&quot;Without a doubt the most original and most memorable fantasy debut of 2011. It's difficult to imagine how another book could top this one.&quot;\n-RisingShadows.net \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee49c213aeb77b521ce752ee81d51ebb8d0d73ae","amp;dn":"Prince+of+thorns+mark+lawrence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee49c213aeb77b521ce752ee81d51ebb8d0d73ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,73,194,19,174,183,123,82,28,231,82,238,129,213,30,187,141,13,115,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
