Their music is a mix of aleatoric, electronica, folk, and acoustic music (de Jong is a cellist and Zammuto plays acoustic guitar and electric bass), incorporating samples of sounds, speech and music. They have released three albums, all on the German (Cologne) label Tomlab. They are currently recording and residing in North Adams, Massachusetts.\n\nTheir 2006 live shows consisted primarily of live acoustic performance (cello, guitar and vocals), played with prerecorded electronics and synchronized video. \n\nTheir music (\\&quot;Tokyo\\&quot; from The Lemon of Pink) was featured in the KnowHIVAIDS television ad campaign.[1] (Wikipedia)\n\n    * Thought for Food (2002) (CD/LP)\n    * The Lemon of Pink (2003) (CD/LP)\n    * Lost and Safe (2005) (CD/LP)\n    * Music for a French Elevator and Other Short Format Oddities by the Books (2006) (Mini CD)\n\nYou can listen to some of their music at their site: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://linkanon.com/?r=http://www.thebooksmusic.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://linkanon.com/?r=http://www.thebooksmusic.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b693453141483ee0a0b1bfcd960ac14fd4690b57","amp;dn":"The+Books+%284+Albums%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b693453141483ee0a0b1bfcd960ac14fd4690b57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,147,69,49,65,72,62,224,160,177,191,205,150,10,193,79,212,105,11,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
