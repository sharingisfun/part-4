The name itself guaranteed attention, as one of the most ludicrous and heavy-handed &quot;far out&quot; monikers of the psychedelic era, even outdoing formidable competition such as the Peanut Butter Conspiracy. Although the group were competent musicians with streaks of imagination, their albums were generally poor third cousins to the West Coast psychedelic groups that served as their obvious inspirations.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tPsychedelic Rock\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Gilded Lamp Of The Cosmos\n02.Visions Of Your Reality\n03.Jazz Thing\n04.Mind Flowers\n05.Where You're At\n06.Suite Genesis Of Beauty (In Four Parts)\n07.Fifth Horseman Of The Apocalypse\n08.Fragmentary March Of Green\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a752017a83f9420f747adeed43ec544b87aa5895","amp;dn":"Ultimate+Spinach+-+Behold+%26+See+%281968%29+MP3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a752017a83f9420f747adeed43ec544b87aa5895","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,82,1,122,131,249,66,15,116,122,222,237,67,236,84,75,135,170,88,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
