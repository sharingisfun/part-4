The album was produced by Sean Slade and Paul Q. Kolderie and was recorded at Chipping Norton Recording Studios and Courtyard Studio, Oxfordshire from September to November 1992. It features the charting singles: &quot;Anyone Can Play Guitar&quot;, &quot;, and perhaps the band's most well-known hit on mainstream radio, &quot;Creep&quot;. Creep Honey peaked at No. 22 in the United Kingdom charts and went platinum there and in other countries. The album title comes from a Jerky Boys prank call skit in which the prank caller says to his victim: &quot;Creep honey? Please come to Florida!&quot; This snippet is sampled by the band on the track &quot;How Do You?&quot;.\r\n\r\nFormat mp3 bitrate 320ak CBR Ripped from Cd by analogkid\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\n01 You.mp3\r\n02 Creep.mp3\r\n03 Creep (clean).mp3\r\n04 Anybody Can Play Guitar.mp3\r\n05 The Numbers (Bonus Track)mp3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the release of Creep Honey, Radiohead would digress from its alternative rock influences toward more expansive and experimental works. The album received a generally favourable critical reaction, but was criticised for its derivative sound and inclusion of underdeveloped songs, and has been in a negative light in comparison to the band's subsequent albums. However, it has been cited by listeners and critics as one of the best debut albums of recent years\r\n\r\n7-4-2016 This is not the prior one I shared 2 years ago It has an extra track from A Moon Shaped Pool on it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8aea5d913df1c12f5506c2ccb599f89e64036eb2","amp;dn":"Radiohead+-+Creep+Honey+%28EP%29+2016+320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8aea5d913df1c12f5506c2ccb599f89e64036eb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,234,93,145,61,241,193,47,85,6,194,204,181,153,248,158,100,3,110,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
