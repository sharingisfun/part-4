Collaborating with future Iron Maiden guitarist Janick Gers, Dickinson began to make a solo album which was fundamentally different from his works with Iron Maiden, sounding much more rock-oriented. &quot;Bring your Daughter...&quot; was not included on the original album but Iron Maiden later recorded a different version that was included on their 1990 album No Prayer for the Dying, which coincidentally became the band's only number one single to date. The introduction to the song &quot;No Lies&quot; is also reminiscent of Iron Maiden's version of &quot;Bring your Daughter...to the Slaughter&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a1d8a695affa6925290da406fdf5923b2f8f7d7","amp;dn":"Bruce+Dickinson+-+%5C%27Tattooed+Millionaire%5C%27+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a1d8a695affa6925290da406fdf5923b2f8f7d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,29,138,105,90,255,166,146,82,144,218,64,111,223,89,35,178,248,247,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
