The daughters of a Marine Corps captain, Ann (born June 19, 1950) and Nancy (born March 16, 1954) grew up in both Southern California and Taiwan before the Wilson family settled in Seattle, WA. Throughout their formative years, both were interested in folk and pop music; while Ann never took any formal music lessons as a child (she later learned to play several instruments), Nancy took up guitar and flute. After both sisters spent some time at college, they decided to try their hand as professional musicians, and while Nancy began performing as a folksinger, Ann joined the all-male vocal group Heart.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Barracuda (Album Version)\n02.Magic Man (Live)\n03.Dream Of The Archer (Album Version)\n04.Alone (Live)\n05.Straight On (Album Version)\n06.Love Alive (Album Version)\n07.Even It Up (Album Version)\n08.Johnny Moon (Album Version)\n09.Dog &amp; Butterfly (Album Version)\n10.Allies (Album Version)\n11.Mistral Wind (Album Version)\n12.Crazy On You (Live Version)\n13.These Dreams (Live)\n14.Dreamboat Annie (Reprise) (Live Album Version)\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d3de132d47a20b8e12862ed8dbbe1afac4b0000","amp;dn":"Heart+-+Playlist+The+Very+Best+Of+Heart+%282008%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d3de132d47a20b8e12862ed8dbbe1afac4b0000","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,61,225,50,212,122,32,184,225,40,98,237,141,187,225,175,172,75,0,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
