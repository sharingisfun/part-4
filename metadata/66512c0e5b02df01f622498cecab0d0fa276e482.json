Young Einstein identified a paradox between Newtonian Mechanics and MaxwellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s equations which pointed to a flawed understanding of space and time by the scientists of the day. In Relativity, Einstein presents his findings using a minimal amount of mathematical language, but the text can still be challenging for readers who lack an extensive scientific background.\n\n The Routledge Guidebook to EinsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Relativity expands on and supplements this seminal text, by exploring:\n\n the historical context of EinsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work and the background to his breakthroughs\n details of experimental verification of special and general relativity\n the enduring legacy of EinsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theories and their implications for future scientific breakthroughs.\n\n\n This is an essential introduction for students of physics, philosophy and history in understanding the key elements of the work and the importance of this classic text to society today","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66512c0e5b02df01f622498cecab0d0fa276e482","amp;dn":"The+Routledge+Guidebook+to+Einstein%27s+Relativity+%282015%29+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66512c0e5b02df01f622498cecab0d0fa276e482","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,81,44,14,91,2,223,1,246,34,73,140,236,171,13,15,162,118,228,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
