The APBC Book of Companion Animal Behaviour compiles the insights and experience of authors at the forefront of this expanding science to provide expert and professional perspectives that will enhance the relationship between a pet and its owner. Pet behaviour, whether dogs, cats or rabbits, is affected by their ethology (the science of animal behaviour) while it is also important to understand how learning and emotional response can govern their actions. Some of Britain s best-known animal experts propose solutions to problem behaviour in ground-breaking essays, as well as providing guidance on the relationship between pets and children (including the arrival of a new baby), rage syndrome in dogs, how to rehabilitate rescue dogs and cats, plus advice on legal and welfare issues. This is the complete book, now fully revised and updated, for all professionals and pet lovers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c19a8e4a6258d8bec5557663cb35020f9a441a67","amp;dn":"The+APBC+Book+of+Companion+Animal+Behaviour+%282016%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c19a8e4a6258d8bec5557663cb35020f9a441a67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,154,142,74,98,88,216,190,197,85,118,99,203,53,2,15,154,68,26,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
