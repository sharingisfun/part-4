The original uploader collected every single plugin, visualization, skin, language pack, you name it, and organized them as they were exactly on the addons page.\n\nIm not sure why it was deleted off TPB, but i got it before it was gone, and here i upload it for all, for whoever wants them.\n\n\nBear in mind that the Winamp plugin page was rarely updated and Winamp itself over the years natively implemented most of the important features third party plugins added. Alot dont even work with the latest Winamp version, and some can even crash Winamp. Some of the really good plugins that are irreplaceable (like the input plugins) have been updated but on the developers page, not the Winamp addons page, so the plugins you find here are probably not the most recent version. Heck some are even a decade old.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4578186f850235afded3f86de24ca9c3c749b31f","amp;dn":"Winamp+v5.666+build+3516+%2B+Key+%2B+ALL+ADDONS%2C+SKINS%2C+%26amp%3B+VISUAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4578186f850235afded3f86de24ca9c3c749b31f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,120,24,111,133,2,53,175,222,211,248,109,226,76,169,195,199,73,179,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
