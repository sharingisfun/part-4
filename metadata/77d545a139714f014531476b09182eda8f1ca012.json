It is filled with quotes from authoritative ancient and contemporary Muslim scholars, accompanied with documented, detailed references from their own Arab textbooks. It also contains shocking information revealing that Muhamed not only owned slaves but worked as a merchant in this ugly business.\n Many Muslim converts to Christianity have shared in the research contained in this book. Muslims who have found the truth and are experiencing an abundant, meaningful life in Christ Jesus. We believe that many more Muslims will come to enjoy the one true, living God, and Islam will be exposed and defeated. Our Muslim friends must be delivered from it's deception and be brought into a saving knowledge of the truth about our Savior, Jesus Christ.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77d545a139714f014531476b09182eda8f1ca012","amp;dn":"Behind+the+Veil%3A+Unmasking+Islam+-+Abd+El+Schafi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77d545a139714f014531476b09182eda8f1ca012","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,213,69,161,57,113,79,1,69,49,71,107,9,24,46,218,143,28,160,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
