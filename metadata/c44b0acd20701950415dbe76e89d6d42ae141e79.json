The queen of the growling throat is back with a sequel to her 2003 debut, The Soul Sessions, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dropping into a post-Adele world. The two powerhouses are not truly competitors Ã¢â‚¬â€ Adele caters to the Top 40, Joss less so Ã¢â‚¬â€ but both are soul-styled Brits with AK-47s where their larynges should be. Since StoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2009 Colour Me Free, the charts have been in a committed relationship with AdeleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rolling In The DeepÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Someone Like You.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Heck, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not even the most famous Joss in the world anymore. But you know what Stone has that sets her apart?\n\nGrit, and the ghost of Janis Joplin coming out of her mouth.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c44b0acd20701950415dbe76e89d6d42ae141e79","amp;dn":"Joss+Stone+-+The+Soul+Sessions+Volume+2+%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c44b0acd20701950415dbe76e89d6d42ae141e79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,75,10,205,32,112,25,80,65,93,190,118,232,157,109,66,174,20,30,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
