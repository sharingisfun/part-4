Overall, probabilistic concepts play an increasingly important role in mathematics, physics, biology, financial engineering and computer science. They help us in understanding magnetism, amorphous media, genetic diversity and the perils of random developments at financial markets, and they guide us in constructing more efficient algorithms.\n\n===================================================================================\nThe reviews of the second edition:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The book under review is a standard graduate textbook in this area of mathematics that collects various classical and modern topics in a friendly volume. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ the book contains many exercises. It is a very good source for a course in probability theory for advanced undergraduates and first-year graduate students. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ the book should be useful for a wide range of audiences, including students, instructors, and researchers from all branches of science who are dealing with random phenomena.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Mehdi Hassani, MAA Reviews, May, 2014)\n\n===================================================================================\nFrom the Back Cover\nThe title covers a wide variety of topics, many of which are not usually found in introductory textbooks, such as:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ limit theorems for sums of random variables\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ martingales\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ percolation\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Markov chains and electrical networks\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ construction of stochastic processes\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Poisson point process and infinite divisibility\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ large deviation principles and statistical physics\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Brownian motion\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ stochastic integral and stochastic differential equations.\n\nThe theory is developed rigorously and in a self-contained way, with the chapters on measure theory interlaced with the probabilistic chapters in order to display the power of the abstract concepts in probability theory. This second edition has been carefully extended and includes many new features. It contains updated figures (over 50), computer simulations and some difficult proofs have been made more accessible. A wealth of examples and more than 270 exercises as well as biographic details of key mathematicians support and enliven the presentation. It will be of use to students and researchers in mathematics and statistics in physics, computer science, economics and biology.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b1b2e32de1a33a491171412647c64e61f39e683","amp;dn":"Achim+Klenke+-+Probability+Theory.+A+Comprehensive+Course+%5B2014%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b1b2e32de1a33a491171412647c64e61f39e683","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,27,46,50,222,26,51,164,145,23,20,18,100,124,100,230,31,57,230,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
