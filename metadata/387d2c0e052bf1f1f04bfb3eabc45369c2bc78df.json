These redistributable files are normally already present on most systems and are not generally included in application setup/install scripts - doing so would add about 1.5 MB to the size of the package, and cause a longer installation process. More importantly, as these files are constantly updated by Microsoft and are operating-system specific, including these files in an application installer could result in incorrect files being added in your system and subsequent problems.\n\nIn rare cases these files may be missing or out of date on your system. In this case an error will be reported when you start the program. Here are some examples of the errors that could be reported:\nIf the files are missing...\n'The dynamic link library MSVCP60.DLL could not be found in the specified path...'\nor\n'The dynamic link library MSVCRT.DLL could not be found in the specified path...'\nIf the files are out of date...\n'The OCXTS.EXE file is linked to missing export MFC42.DLL:6880.'\n\n\n\nIf you see one of these messages, visit www.microsoft.com for more information regarding these files and how to restore them.\n\n\n\n           Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it! Done.\n\n\n                   3Nj0Y!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:387d2c0e052bf1f1f04bfb3eabc45369c2bc78df","amp;dn":"MakeMusic+Finale+2012c+R13+-+CHAOS%21+%5Bdeepstatus%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"387d2c0e052bf1f1f04bfb3eabc45369c2bc78df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,125,44,14,5,43,241,241,240,75,251,62,171,196,83,105,194,188,120,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
