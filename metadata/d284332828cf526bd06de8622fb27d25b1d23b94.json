It is particularly aimed at practising analysts who lack specialist knowledge of a particular measurement technique, and who need immediate guidance and advice at hand. Each monograph provides the practical detail which working analysts need, explaining key facts and concepts in a concise and readable manner which new graduates and non-specialists will be able to follow. This wide-ranging series covers established and emerging techniques in sample preparation, detection systems, fibre optics for chemical sensing, environmental monitoring and process analytical chemistry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d284332828cf526bd06de8622fb27d25b1d23b94","amp;dn":"RSC+Analytical+Spectroscopy+Monographs+%5BUpdated+at+2016.10.05%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d284332828cf526bd06de8622fb27d25b1d23b94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,132,51,40,40,207,82,107,208,109,232,98,47,178,125,37,177,210,59,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
