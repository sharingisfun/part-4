Here, young Milos Hrma takes a job as a rail guard trainee, following a long family tradition of avoiding laborious work. His father was a conductor, retired early and now living off a pension; his grandfather was killed when he, single-handedly, tried to stop the German advance into Prague through hypnotism. Now, Milos will learn the trade of train dispatcher, making sure the trains don't crash, and being especially careful with the &quot;closely watched&quot; trains carrying troops and munitions to the German frontline. Czech director Jiri Menzel's Closely Watched Trains (Ostre sledovane vlaky) was the recipient of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1968.\n\nRip Specs (BD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Closely Watched Trains.1966.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 7 276 Kbps\nLength            : 4.72 GiB for 1h 32mn 47s 84ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 6 500 Kbps\nAspect            : 986 x 720 (1.369) at 24.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : DTS at 768 Kbps\nInfos             : 1 channel, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : cs\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : cs\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060802/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060802/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Czech, German\nSubtitles: Czech, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b3b326b9328a2e23636b149a285458efd099e84","amp;dn":"Closely+Watched+Trains.1966.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b3b326b9328a2e23636b149a285458efd099e84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,59,50,107,147,40,162,226,54,54,177,73,162,133,69,142,253,9,158,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
