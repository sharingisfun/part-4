It&amp;#039;s the story of a family. It&amp;#039;s the story of what happens when adults have children and those children go to school. And Brak is in it. He lives in a house. A house on a quiet street not unlike yours or mine. A house in a neighborhood. That&amp;#039;s The Brak Show.&quot; So goes Cartoon network&amp;#039;s description of the new sitcom starring Brak, the absent-minded space pirate from the Space Ghost cartoons. He goes through the all the typical sitcom situations with his friend Zorak. Also along for the ride are Brak&amp;#039;s parents, his friend Clarence, and his next-door neighbor Thundercleese.\nWIKI: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brak_Show\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0297512/\n\nDirectors: Jim Fortier, Pete Smith.\nWriters: Jim Fortier, Andy Merrill, Pete Smith, Chris Ward.\nStarring: Andy Merrill, C.
