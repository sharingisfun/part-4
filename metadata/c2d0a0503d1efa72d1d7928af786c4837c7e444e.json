In six short lessons of about twenty minutes, each of the two systems of &quot;kana&quot; writing are introduced in such a way that the absolute beginner can acquire fluency in writing in a fraction of the time normally devoted to the task.\n\nUsing the same basic self-taught method devised for learning the kanji, and in collaboration with Helmut Morsbach and Kazue Kurebayashi, the author breaks the shapes of the two syllabaries into their component parts and draws on what he calls &quot;imaginative memory&quot; to aid the student in reassembling them into images that fix the sound of each particular kana to its writing.. . and have fun in the process.\n\nAbout the Author\nJames W. Heisig is professor and permanent research fellow at the Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture in Nagoya, Japan. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2d0a0503d1efa72d1d7928af786c4837c7e444e","amp;dn":"Heisig%5C%27s+Guide+to+Remembering+the+Kana","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2d0a0503d1efa72d1d7928af786c4837c7e444e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,208,160,80,61,30,250,114,209,215,146,138,247,134,196,131,124,126,68,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
