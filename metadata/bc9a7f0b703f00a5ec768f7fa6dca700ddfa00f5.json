Ayreon's music is described as progressive rock,[1] progressive metal and power metal[2] sometimes combined with genres such as folk, electronica, experimental and classical music. The majority of Ayreon's albums are dubbed &quot;rock operas&quot; (or &quot;metal operas&quot;) because the albums contain complex storylines featuring a host of characters, usually with each one being represented by a unique vocalist.\r\n\r\nAyreon's music is characterized by the use of traditional instruments in rock music (guitars, bass guitar, drums, analogue synthesizers, electric organs) mixed with instruments more native to folk and classical music.\r\nThe project, directed by Lucassen's former manager Yvette Boertje, was originally supposed to be a fan-made project; however, after some of the original cast and musicians showed interest in the project, the organizers decided to make it a greater venture. \r\n\r\nAyreon - The Theater Equation (2-CD) 2016 320ak\r\nYear: 2016\r\nStyle: Progressive Metal\r\nCountry: Netherlands\r\nFormat: 320 mp3\r\nSize: 252.17 MB\r\n\r\n\r\nAdded: 16/06/2016 \r\nFiles: 29\r\n\r\nDescription: \r\nLength  : 01:48:49\r\n\r\nTracks :\r\n\r\nAct I No. Title Length\r\n\r\n01. &quot;Day One: Vigil&quot;\r\n02. &quot;Overture&quot;\r\n03. &quot;Day Two: Isolation&quot;\r\n04. &quot;Day Three: Pain&quot; (Lucassen/Devin Townsend)\r\n05. &quot;Day Four: Mystery&quot;\r\n06. &quot;Day Five: Voices&quot;\r\n07. &quot;Pain II&quot;\r\n08. &quot;Day Six: Childhood&quot;\r\n09. &quot;Day Seven: Hope&quot;\r\n10. &quot;Day Eight: School&quot; (Lucassen/Townsend)\r\n11. &quot;Childhood II&quot;\r\n12. &quot;Day Nine: Playground&quot; (Adaptation of Edvard Grieg's Morning mood)\r\n13. &quot;Day Ten: Memories&quot;\r\n14. &quot;Pain III&quot;\r\n15. &quot;Day Eleven: Love&quot;\r\n\r\n Act II No. Title Length\r\n\r\n16. &quot;Overture II&quot;\r\n17. &quot;Day Twelve: Trauma&quot;\r\n18. &quot;Day Thirteen: Sign&quot; (Lucassen/Heather Findley)\r\n19. &quot;Day Fourteen: Pride&quot;\r\n20. &quot;Vigil II&quot;\r\n21. &quot;Day Fifteen: Betrayal&quot;\r\n22. &quot;School II&quot;\r\n23. &quot;Day Sixteen: Loser&quot; (Lucassen/Townsend)\r\n24. &quot;Day Seventeen: Accident?&quot; (Lucassen/Devon Graves)\r\n25. &quot;Pain IV&quot;\r\n26. &quot;Day Eighteen: Realization&quot;\r\n27. &quot;Trauma II&quot;\r\n28. &quot;Day Nineteen: Disclosure&quot;\r\n29. &quot;Day Twenty: Confrontation&quot;\r\n30. &quot;Finale&quot;\r\n\r\n Line-Up:\r\n\r\nMulti-instrumentalist and vocalist Arjen A.
