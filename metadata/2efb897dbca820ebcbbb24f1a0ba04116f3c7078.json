According to Claptons autobiography, the recordings werent intended to become an album. The band had rented the studio, but Clapton didnt have any songs written, so he suggested they record Robert Johnson songs. They recorded enough songs for an album and it was decided to release them as such.\n\nRipped from my cd to FLAC using dBpoweramp in Secure Mode.  All tracks properly tagged with artwork embedded.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2efb897dbca820ebcbbb24f1a0ba04116f3c7078","amp;dn":"ERIC+CLAPTON+Me+and+Mr+Johnson+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2efb897dbca820ebcbbb24f1a0ba04116f3c7078","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,251,137,125,188,168,32,235,203,187,36,241,160,186,4,17,111,60,112,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
