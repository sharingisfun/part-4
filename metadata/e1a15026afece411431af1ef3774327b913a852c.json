Howard passes the time in a bottle; his brother Bengy is child in a man's body; sister Caddy has come crawling home after years of being kept by a string of &quot;admirers&quot;. Only Jason, the cruel, cold-hearted adopted head of the family, and Quentin, who was abandoned at birth by Caddy, have the fire and the fury needed to put the family back on its feet again. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1a15026afece411431af1ef3774327b913a852c","amp;dn":"The+Sound+and+the+Fury+%281959%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1a15026afece411431af1ef3774327b913a852c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,161,80,38,175,236,228,17,67,26,241,239,55,116,50,123,145,58,133,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
