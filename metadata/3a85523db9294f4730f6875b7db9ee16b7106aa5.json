To that end, it's a more or less chronological overview of the combo's LPs, commencing with a trio of tunes from a spring 1967 studio session that predates their self-titled debut (1967). Primary is an extended, seven-plus-minute &quot;On the Road Again,&quot; losing the trippy pretensions of the more popular version. Rather, it churns and steadily burns throughout, displaying Canned Heat's primordial boogie-fused R&amp;B delivery. The remainder of disc one focuses on the aforementioned Canned Heat (1967), the follow-up Boogie With Canned Heat (1968), and a half-dozen previously unreleased sides, this time from the fall of 1967 with a slightly different lineup that included Alan &quot;Blind Owl&quot; Wilson (guitar/vocals), Larry &quot;The Mole&quot; Taylor (bass), Henry &quot;Sunflower&quot; Vestine (guitar), and Bob &quot;The Bear&quot; Hite (vocals). Frank Cook (drums), who had contributed to the band's first effort, was replaced by Adolfo &quot;Fido&quot; de la Parra (drums). It is this aggregate that is considered the core of the &quot;classic&quot; incarnation. They are thoroughly solid, especially on John Lee Hooker's &quot;Whiskey and Wimmen&quot; (sic), a title that would resurface several years later when they faced off with Hooker on Hooker 'n' Heat (1971). Another not-to-be-missed rarity is the nearly ten-minute &quot;Gotta Boogie&quot; jam building off of Hooker's familiar rambling &quot;Boogie Chillen&quot; riff, as it explores some of Canned Heat's trademark instrumental interaction. This is most prominent between Wilson and Hite, and predates &quot;Fried Hockey Boogie,&quot; although the vibe is undeniably the same. Disc one ends with two vintage radio adverts for Levi Strauss &amp; Company and Boogie With Canned Heat, respectively. Disc two picks up with the singles &quot;Evil Woman&quot; and &quot;Amphetamine Annie,&quot; among the other anticipatory tracks. Also included are &quot;Going Up the Country,&quot; &quot;Time Was,&quot; a take of the seasonal release &quot;Christmas Blues&quot; with Dr. John, as well as a 1968 vocal-less reworking of Robert Johnson's &quot;Terraplane Blues&quot; ? the latter pair being offered here for the first time. The same is true of the Hooker 'n' Heat outtake &quot;It's All Right&quot; and the poignant reading of &quot;Human Condition,&quot; featuring Wilson on lead vocals. While those are the only hard-to-find recordings on this disc, there are two radio ads at the tail end. Otherwise, the albums Living the Blues (1968), Hallelujah (1969), Future Blues (1970), Historical Figures &amp; Ancient Heads (1971), as well as The New Age (1973), are given their due, though most casual listeners and/or purists may see these to be filler rather than killer. The accompanying 28-page liner booklet is filled with discographical information and a great historical essay from noted music journalist Greg Russo. \n \nCanned Heat / Uncanned!
