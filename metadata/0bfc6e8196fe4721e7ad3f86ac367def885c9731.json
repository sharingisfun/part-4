PHP is a great language to carry this out. In this course, developer Mark Niemann-Ross focuses on helping adults who are experienced with PHP pass their coding skills on to a child or student. Each inquiry-oriented chapter consists of seven parts:\n\n    Teacher's Guide: Introduces the concepts in the chapter and preps the adult on places where the student might get stuck\n    Try It: Immediately engages the student, showing working code in action\n    Check It Out: Encourages the adult and student to engage with and edit some existing code\n    The Facts: A lecture for the student to watch\n    Extend It: An exploration of expanded and extended concepts\n    Challenge: A hands-on coding challenge for the student\n    Solution: A step-by-step solution presented by the author\n\n\n\nThis course, in essence, acts as a lesson plan to help you teach PHP to a beginner. Its structured curriculum supports those who have a solid understanding of PHP, but don't necessarily know how to teach PHP effectively to kids.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bfc6e8196fe4721e7ad3f86ac367def885c9731","amp;dn":"Lynda-+Teach+Kids+Programming+with+PHP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bfc6e8196fe4721e7ad3f86ac367def885c9731","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,252,110,129,150,254,71,33,231,173,63,134,172,54,125,239,136,92,151,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
