Boots in about 30 seconds with 1GB RAM allocated to the host. Make sure to watch the setup video to get it set up properly.\n\nEverything should work perfectly. XCode can be installed via the App Store, as it functions *perfectly* as a Mac. AMD users should consult the setup guide beforehand as only certain models work so it's your call if you want to try it or not.\n\nThe .exe is an SFX archive, double-click to extract. When extracted it's around 7GB. Works with Player, Workstation and Fusion, both old and new versions. Watch the Setup Guide to set it all up properly (it'll help you to no end). Without following the setup guide it's more than likely you'll have no luck.\n\nPlease note: The Hardware Bypasser included was created using Tola's Patching Engine 2.03b and packaged using UPX 3.07, which results in false reports from certain virus scanners. All it does is reconstruct the vmware-vmx.exe file in the VMware Program Files folder when run. If you're unwilling to take my word for it, just open the archive in 7zip (before you extract) and delete &quot;vmware-vmx-patch.exe&quot;, which will remove it. \n\nIf you wanna follow my work/releases follow us at http://souldevteam.net/blog.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db67cc4821f9720b864e8f2c97f0cc7869edd619","amp;dn":"Mac+OS+X+Lion+10.7.5+VMware+Image","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db67cc4821f9720b864e8f2c97f0cc7869edd619","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,103,204,72,33,249,114,11,134,78,143,44,151,240,204,120,105,237,214,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
