It has been certified Platinum in several countries, including the UK and the US.\n Despite its success, it would be the last album that band members Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith would work on together\n for over a decade.\n\n======================================\n\nTracklist\n  \n1\tWoman in Chains\t6:28\n2\tBadman's Song\t8:33\n3\tSowing the Seeds of Love\t6:18\n4\tAdvice for the Young at Heart\t4:47\n5\tStanding On The Corner Of The Third World\t5:34\n6\tSwords and Knives\t6:20\n7\tYear of the Knife\t6:55\n8\tFamous Last Words\t4:23\n\n=========================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 1023 MiB\nAlbum                                    : The Seeds Of Love\nPerformer                                : Tears For Fears\nRecorded date                            : 1989\n\n=========================================\n\nAudio\n\n\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 2 933 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 96.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 24 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95644b588a2447fe1eea0c983c63066444d2b171","amp;dn":"Tears+For+Fears+-+The+Seeds+Of+Love+%281989%29+Flac%5B24Bit+96KHz+Viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95644b588a2447fe1eea0c983c63066444d2b171","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,100,75,88,138,36,71,254,30,234,12,152,60,99,6,100,68,210,177,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
