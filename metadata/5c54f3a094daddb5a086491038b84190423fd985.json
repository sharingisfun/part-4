Dan Burgess thinks he's not impacting anyone for the LORD. Dan Burgess thinks he's missing out on &quot;all the fun&quot;. Dan Burgess wants out of the Christian life. Then... one day... Dan Burgess is forced to take a Second Glance. If you are a Christian and you ever wonder whether your walk with the Lord has any impact on anyone at all, this would be a very encouraging movie to watch! The Lord grants this teenager the wish to see the world as it would be if he had never become a Christian. No prayer that he prayed has ever been answered because he was not a Christian to pray them! No person he ever spoke the Bible to has been affected by the Bible, because he was not a Christian to witness to anyone. The outcome will make you look at prayer and your Christian witness in a completely different light. The film shows the impact a true christian and his testimony has on the world. \n\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: None\nRun Time: 50 minutes\nMy Rating: 9.5/10\nQuality: 9.0/10 \n\nIf financially possible, please buy this CD/DVD to keep Christian films in business. If Christians won't buy Christian films then who will?\n\nPlease seed. Let each one of us who call ourself Christians seed 2-3 movies each. So that these movies may become a blessing to all those who are hungry for God's word &amp; grace. May Jesus bless all those who are seeding the christian torrents.\n\n&quot;Don't ask me what Christ can do for you! \nHe has done all he could. \nTell me what you can do for Christ?&quot;\n\nUploaded by Indian Christian\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c54f3a094daddb5a086491038b84190423fd985","amp;dn":"Second+Glance+%28Christian+Movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c54f3a094daddb5a086491038b84190423fd985","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,84,243,160,148,218,221,181,160,134,73,16,56,184,65,144,66,63,217,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
