In fact, the Latin lilt lightened the beat and the flow remained muddy indeed. So the electricity generated by the percussion-heavy opening cut comes as a pleasant surprise, and the movement of what follows is a surprising pleasure. New second guitarist Neal Schon deserves special thanks for crowding out Gregg Rolie's organ. Maybe soon he'll come up with more than one idea per solo.&quot; B\n- Robert Christgau, Village Voice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48e195cf22b563a890d08fd335fee9aefcd3cf14","amp;dn":"Santana+-+Amigos+%281976+quad+mix+24%2F96+lossless+4.0+DVD-A+%2Avinyl%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48e195cf22b563a890d08fd335fee9aefcd3cf14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,225,149,207,34,181,99,168,144,208,143,211,53,254,233,174,252,211,207,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
