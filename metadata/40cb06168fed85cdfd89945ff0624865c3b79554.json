This oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s seriously ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhands-on.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ It \nwas written by the leaders of one of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s top wireless security auditing \nteams. Penetration testing is crucial to protecting yourself, and this book is \nthe source for mastering it. But it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t just show you how to attack 802.11 \nnetworks -- it shows how to detect and defeat those attacks, too.\n\nFirst, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll assemble the arsenal needed to probe wireless network security: \nhardware, drivers, utilities, network mapping and site surveying tools, and so \nforth. The authors offer knowledgeable advice on cards, chipsets, antennas, \namplifiers, cables, connectors, Linux drivers and wireless extensions, and of \ncourse software tools. When it comes to the underlying hardware, they go beyond \nconventional PCs and notebooks, also discussing iPAQs and Sharp Zauruses running \nLinux: super-handy for monitoring signal strength and discovering rogue access \npoints.\n\nOnce you have your toolset, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll walk through planning your attack, gaining \naccess -- and the awful stuff that can be done once inside. By now, netadmins \nwill be plenty motivated to fight back. The authors teach how, in detail. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll \nlearn how to make the most of cryptography (not just WEP); provide effective \nuser authentication, deploy higher-layer wireless VPNs, even implement a \nwireless IDS system.\n\nWe neednÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t remind you just how vulnerable many 802.11 networks still are, even \nnow. LetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just say, if you want to do something about it, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find this book \nindispensable. Bill Camarda\n\nBill Camarda is a consultant, writer, and web/multimedia content developer. His \n15 books include Special Edition Using Word 2003 and Upgrading &amp; Fixing Networks \nfor Dummies, Second Edition.\nFrom the Publisher\n\nThe definitive guide to penetrating and defending wireless networks.\n\nStraight from the field, this is the definitive guide to hacking wireless \nnetworks. Authored by world-renowned wireless security auditors, this hands-on, \npractical guide covers everything you need to attack -- or protect -- any \nwireless network.\n\nThe authors introduce the 'battlefield,' exposing today's 'wide open' 802.11 \nwireless networks and their attackers. One step at a time, you'll master the \nattacker's entire arsenal of hardware and software tools: crucial knowledge for \ncrackers and auditors alike. Next, you'll learn systematic countermeasures for \nbuilding hardened wireless 'citadels''including cryptography-based techniques, \nauthentication, wireless VPNs, intrusion detection, and more.\n\nCoverage includes:\n\n    * Step-by-step walkthroughs and explanations of typical attacks\n    * Building wireless hacking/auditing toolkit: detailed recommendations, \nranging from discovery tools to chipsets and antennas\n    * Wardriving: network mapping and site surveying\n    * Potential weaknesses in current and emerging standards, including 802.11i, \nPPTP, and IPSec\n    * Implementing strong, multilayered defenses\n    * Wireless IDS: why attackers aren't as untraceable as they think\n    * Wireless hacking and the law: what's legal, what isn't \n\nIf you're a hacker or security auditor, this book will get you in. If you're a \nnetadmin, sysadmin, consultant, or home user, it will keep everyone else out.\nLibrary Journal\n\nWarDriving-or moving around an area to map wireless access points-presents an \nopportunity for those interested in raising awareness of wireless connectivity \nand security vulnerabilities; an opening for those looking to contribute \nconnectivity through deliberately opening access; and a security threat to those \nwho fail to protect their networks-even though ethical WarDrivers point out that \nthey eschew unauthorized network use. WarDriving teaches how to WarDrive, from \nnecessary tools to useful software; each chapter ends with a summary, bullet \npoints, and FAQ. Later chapters discuss how to attack and how to defend wireless \nnetworks, making this useful for readers wanting to protect their networks. The \nmain focus, however, may find a narrow audience in most libraries; those seeking \nbooks on securing their network will want to supplement with more thorough \nguides, and those interested in WarDriving may already be conversant with the \ntools and ideas discussed. A supplemental purchase for larger libraries. Wi-Foo \ncovers similar ground and discusses similar utilities, yet it goes much deeper \ninto the nuts and bolts of both breaking into and defending wireless networks. \nSome more technical sections are balanced out by step-by-step explanations of \nsecurity basics and patterns of attack. Extensive appendixes range from antenna \nirradiation patterns to war-chalking symbols to a penetration testing template. \nWireless security is an ever-growing issue, which makes this thorough guide \nrecommended for larger libraries.
