Founded by singer and guitarist Robb Flynn and bassist Adam Duce, the band has been plagued by lineup changes since its inception. The current lineup of the band comprises Flynn (vocals, guitar), Duce (bass), Phil Demmel (guitar), and Dave McClain (drums). Machine Head is one of the pioneering bands in the New Wave of American Heavy Metal. Machine Head was formed by ex-Vio-lence member Robb Flynn and his roommate, Adam Duce after a physical confrontation between the band and a gang. Fearing for their lives, Flynn departed from Vio-lence and started writing music with Duce, forming Machine Head in 1992. Though the band's first album was a success, Machine Head had a series of albums that earned the band criticism for &quot;selling out&quot;. With four former members, the band nearly disbanded in 2002 after its label, Roadrunner Records, dropped them from the roster due to poor album sales and controversy. The band resigned with Roadrunner soon after and have released two albums since then. In 2007, the band released The Blackening, which was named the band's &quot;masterpiece&quot; and earned Machine Head its first Grammy Award nomination.\n\nimage\nThis release contains a couple of covers, done live &amp; in studio of well known bands!
