Analog modeling techniques have been employed to create a DSP-algorithm that accurately emulates every aspect of the original TB-303, from growling basses to hollow middles and beeping highs with metal rattling accents. Patterns are composed in a fashion similar to the original using the integrated step sequencer with easy to use manipulation functions such as transpose and randomization\n\n\n\nAudioRealism Bass Line Pro (ABL Pro) v1.2.1.8\n\n\n\nWhat would a 303 on steroids be like? We answered that question using a mock-up by our friend AlphaDog and adding some more stuff like patch cables and polyphony, and it turned out to be a very different beast indeed. While ABL Pro has it's roots in sequenced synth sounds it also excels at pads and leads and is something of a hidden gem for many producers. We guarantee you nothing else sounds quite like ABL Pro.\n\n\n\nAudioRealism Drum Machine (ADM) v1.3.3.0\n\n\n\nBooming bassdrums, saucy cymbals and crispy snares can be used to describe the sound of drum machines from the early 80's. ADM contains three classic vintage drum machines from that era rolled into one, combined with a 32-step internal sequencer and pattern controlled fx (PCF). Get all your patterns into ADM via the Import Rebirth function or directly from your old 909 via sysex (we will provide a free tool for dumping sysex).\n\n\nsee more at --&gt; http://www.audiorealism.se/products.htm\n\n\nSystem Requirements  \n\nWindows\n\n   - Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7\n   - Pentium 4 or better\n   - Host software that is compatible with 32 or 64-bit  VST 2.4 for example Cubase, Ableton Live, Fruity Loops\n\nMac OS X\n\n   - OS X 10.6 or later (32-bit)\n   - OS X 10.7 or later (64-bit)\n   - 1 GHz Intel CPU or better\n   - Host software that is compatible with 32 or 64-bit  VST 2.4 or Audio Unit for example Logic, Garage Band, Ableton, Cubase\n\n\n\n[Installation]\n\nUnRar.\n\nInstall.\n\nUse serial provided.\n\nAlways remember to block your Daw in firewall\n\n\n\n\n\n          [b]Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
