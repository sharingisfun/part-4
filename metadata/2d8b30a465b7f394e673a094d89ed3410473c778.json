By breaking the narrative into seven distinct chapters, which are both chronological and overlapping, Jencks charts the ebb and flow of the movement, the peaks and troughs of different ideas and themes. The book is highly visual. As well as providing a chronological account of the movement, each chapter also has a special feature on the major works of a given period. The first upÃ¢â‚¬â€œtoÃ¢â‚¬â€œdate narrative of PostÃ¢â‚¬â€œModern Architecture Ã¢â‚¬â€œ other major books on the subject were written 20 years ago. An accessible narrative that will appeal to students who are new to the subject, as well as those who can remember its heyday in the 70s and 80s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d8b30a465b7f394e673a094d89ed3410473c778","amp;dn":"The+Story+of+Post-modernism+-+Five+Decades+of+the+Ironic%2C+Iconic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d8b30a465b7f394e673a094d89ed3410473c778","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,139,48,164,101,183,243,148,230,115,160,148,216,158,211,65,4,115,199,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
