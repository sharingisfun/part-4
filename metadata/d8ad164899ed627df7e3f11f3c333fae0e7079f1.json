Both wrote music and lyrics; it's clearly a pick 'em situation. \n\nPorter had violin and piano lessons as a child, pursued undergraduate studies at Yale (where he penned fight songs that endure to this day such as &quot;Bulldog&quot;), and studied law and music at Harvard, all courtesy of a rich grandfather. \nHis grandfather was appalled Porter would consider music as a career and never forgave him. Porter was in the French army during World War I, and spent the '20s in Paris as the husband of a wealthy woman. He began scoring hits in that decade, though &quot;I'm in Love Again,&quot; didn't click until 1929, though Porter wrote it in 1924. \n\nThe list of Porter shows and films is immense; his lyrics were literate, sophisticated, yet could be charming, suggestive, even naughty. His first show was Paris in 1928; it included &quot;Let's Do It.&quot; That was followed by Frenchmen in 1929 containing &quot;You Do Something to Me.&quot; Porter returned to New York in 1930, but was a lifelong Parisian in his heart. \n\nWake Up and Dream, The New Yorkers, The Gay Divorcee, Jubilee, Leave It to Me, and Kiss Me Kate are only a few of his marvelous shows. The song list is just as impressive; &quot;What Is This Thing Called Love,&quot; &quot;Love for Sale,&quot; &quot;Anything Goes,&quot; &quot;You're the Top,&quot; &quot;Begin the Beguine,&quot; and &quot;Count Your Blessings,&quot; for starters. \nThere were also such films as Silk Stockings, Born to Dance, Broadway Melody of 1940, High Society, and Night and Day. Porter's legs were crushed by a horse in 1937, he endured numerous operations the rest of his life, as well as being a semi-invalid. He finally lost his right leg in 1958, only four years after his wife died. But his songs live on; numerous anthologies and songbooks devoted to his music have been issued and are available on CD.\n\nProduct Description\n\n42 tracks on two discs. \nDisc 1 - 1.
