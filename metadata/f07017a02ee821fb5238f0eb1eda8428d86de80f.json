She has entered, she realizes, a parallel existence, which she calls 1Q84 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œQ is for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“question mark.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ A world that bears a question.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Meanwhile, an aspiring writer named Tengo takes on a suspect ghostwriting project. He becomes so wrapped up with the work and its unusual author that, soon, his previously placid life begins to come unraveled.\n\nAs AomameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and TengoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s narratives converge over the course of this single year, we learn of the profound and tangled connections that bind them ever closer: a beautiful, dyslexic teenage girl with a unique vision; a mysterious religious cult that instigated a shoot-out with the metropolitan police; a reclusive, wealthy dowager who runs a shelter for abused women; a hideously ugly private investigator; a mild-mannered yet ruthlessly efficient bodyguard; and a peculiarly insistent television-fee collector.\n\nA love story, a mystery, a fantasy, a novel of self-discovery, a dystopia to rival George OrwellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½1Q84 is Haruki MurakamiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most ambitious undertaking yet: an instant best seller in his native Japan, and a tremendous feat of imagination from one of our most revered contemporary writers.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMurakami is like a magician who explains what heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s doing as he performs the trick and still makes you believe he has supernatural powers . . . But while anyone can tell a story that resembles a dream, it's the rare artist, like this one, who can make us feel that we are dreaming it ourselves.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The New York Times Book Review\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f07017a02ee821fb5238f0eb1eda8428d86de80f","amp;dn":"Haruki+Murakami+-+1Q84","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f07017a02ee821fb5238f0eb1eda8428d86de80f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,112,23,160,46,232,33,251,82,56,240,235,30,218,132,40,216,109,232,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
