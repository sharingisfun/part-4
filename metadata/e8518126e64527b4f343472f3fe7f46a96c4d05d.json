The Immortals of Meluha\n2. The Secret of the Nagas\n3.The Oath of the Vayuputras\n\nFormat : PDF and EPUB\n\nShiva Trilogy is a mythological novel clubbed with fiction that portrays one of the mightiest gods of Indian mythology Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Shiva, Mahadev Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as a mortal human being. The foundation is strong that relates to everybody and also sends out a message. The book is based on the belief that perhaps the actions, the deeds and karma are the only deciding factors in transforming an ordinary man to Mahadev - God of Gods.\n\nNot only Shiva, but the book portrays other related gods &amp; goddess like Parvati, Ganesh, Parshuram as mortals who because of their deeds rose to the stature of gods. In the book Shiva is a Nomad from Mount Kailash, Tibet who travels to the Suryavanshi land of the Meluha. Soon he is named as Neelkanth, after a particular incident, and leads the MeluhanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in their fight against the Chandravanshi. It is an insight into a man realizing his Karma and fate. Dealing with his demons and rising up to his name of Mahadev. Second part deals with the curses of caste, abnormalities &amp; the secret of the Nagas. It highlights the dark side of human society.\n\nThe Specifics\n\nThe names Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Shiva, Parvati, Ganesh and Kali Ã¢â‚¬â€œ are used in original which makes whole story very believable &amp; easy to relate to. A typical portrait of Shiva, snake wound around his blue neck, with his white bull Nandi and his wife Parvati will hold more meaning and mystery to you after reading this book. There is a logical explanation of almost every aspect of the so-called Lord Shiva, his Trishul included. There are fascinating interpretations of the caste system, various philosophies such as the nature of reality, good and evil, amongst others. Everything is created as real, which gives a cutting edge to the story. Everything related to Shiva like Snake, Neelkanth, Somras, Nandi, Marijuana, Dance and other things has been beautifully embedded in the story to keep one involved.\n\nAs the story unfolds, you are bound to think of the hidden message it conveys Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the importance of actions and deeds, good and evil perceptions of the world, illogical practices like caste system &amp; true love. The book also depicts the love story of Shiva &amp; Parvati with an unusual effect on its readers. The action sequences too have been narrated beautifully.
