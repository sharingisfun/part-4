On her rusty bow she bears the name Vital Spark - a throwback to her glory days as star of the BBC's 1994 series The Tales of Para Handy.\r\nChapter 1.\r\nWith no working engine, the team organise for the puffer to be taken under tow through the canal to Crinan, where her restoration begins. They look on nervously as she's carefully winched up the purpose built slipway. This is the first time in almost 30 years she's been out of the water, and at last the team can assess the condition of her hull.\r\nChapter 2.\r\nA biting, cold winter delays exterior work on the puffer, so Duncan keeps himself occupied by taking on the restoration of a vintage Ford truck. When work resumes on the VIC 27, the team set to power-washing and sandblasting the hull. This removes decades' worth of rust and scale - and leaves gaping great holes. The re-plating of the heavily corroded metal looks likely to be time consuming and costly.\r\nChapter 3.\r\nThe boiler is sent to the original manufacturers in Annan with a view to its being restored, but the cash-strapped project suffers the latest in a series of setbacks when the boiler is deemed beyond repair. While a less passionate team might admit defeat, the puffer's restorers fight on. Determined to secure the boat's future as a steam vessel, Auld Reekie's new coal-fired boiler is commissioned and installed.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/44/Air-an-Smuid-Steaming-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/60/Air-an-Smuid-Steaming-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4f/Air-an-Smuid-Steaming-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/47/Air-an-Smuid-Steaming-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8c/Air-an-Smuid-Steaming-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/56/Air-an-Smuid-Steaming-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7f/Air-an-Smuid-Steaming-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/34/Air-an-Smuid-Steaming-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c0/Air-an-Smuid-Steaming-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: h264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 1404Kbps\r\n * Video Resolution: 832x468\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 93.5Kbps CBR 48KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: 2 (Gaelic)\r\n * Run-Time: 88 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1 (3 chapters)\r\n * Part Size: 904 MB\r\n * Source: Webrip\r\n * Subtitles: Embedded English\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06vft28","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9656285791f3cf1bac2b0675b96b3af5c20794c1","amp;dn":"BBC+Air+an+Smuid+Steaming+h264+AAC+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9656285791f3cf1bac2b0675b96b3af5c20794c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,86,40,87,145,243,207,27,172,43,6,117,185,107,58,245,194,7,148,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
