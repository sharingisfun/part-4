It was released in 2004 in the UK and one year later in North America.  The set consists of three CDs that overlook Genesis' career from their formative period with Peter Gabriel and Anthony Phillips, continuing through their period with Phil Collins as lead singer, to their most recent recordings with Ray Wilson as frontman. As with 1998's Genesis Archive 1967Ã¢â‚¬â€œ75, this collection is mostly sequenced in reverse chronological order (apart from the fact that ...Calling All Stations...' title track is at the end of the first disc) for the purpose of providing precedence to the newer material. The majority of the tracks were also remixed by studio collaborator Nick Davis.  Featuring songs from every studio album (not including their 1969 debut From Genesis to Revelation) from 1970's Trespass to 1997's ...Calling All Stations..., Platinum Collection stands as the most comprehensive Genesis retrospective available. Upon its release, it reached #21 in the UK and #100 in the US.  The cover features pictures used on the albums Nursery Cryme (1971), Foxtrot (1972), A Trick of the Tail (1976), Duke (1980), Invisible Touch (1986) and We Can't Dance (1991).\n\n\n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] No Son Of Mine\n[02] I Can't Dance\n[03] Jesus He Knows Me\n[04] Hold On My Heart\n[05] Invisible Touch\n[06] Throwing It All Away\n[07] Tonight Tonight Tonight [Edit]\n[08] Land Of Confusion\n[09] In Too Deep\n[10] Mama\n[11] That's All\n[12] Home By The Sea\n[13] Second Home By The Sea\n[14] Illegal Alien\n[15] Paperlate\n[16] Calling All Stations\n\nCD01 Play Time - 01h:17m:49s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Abacab\n[02] Keep It Dark\n[03] Turn It On Again\n[04] Behind The Lines\n[05] Duchess\n[06] Misunderstanding\n[07] Many Too Many\n[08] Follow You Follow Me\n[09] Undertow\n[10] In That Quiet Earth\n[11] Afterglow\n[12] Your Own Special Way\n[13] A Trick Of The Tail\n[14] Ripples\n[15] Los Endos\n\nCD02 Play Time - 01h:16m:40s\n\nCD03 Track Listings\n\n[01] The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\n[02] Counting Out Time\n[03] Carpet Crawlers\n[04] Firth Of Fifth\n[05] The Cinema Show\n[06] I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)\n[07] Supper's Ready\n[08] The Musical Box\n[09] The Knife\n\nCD03 Play Time - 01h:19m:43s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 03h:54m:12s:\nTotal File Size....................... 545mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
