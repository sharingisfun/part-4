Selecting just a few of the biggest and best known gives you names like Gene Colan, Frank Frazetta, Steve Ditko, Alex Toth, Al Williamson, Wallace Wood, Archie Goodwin, Ernie Colon, Mike Ploog, Dave Cockrum, Doug Moench and Richard Corben, but there are SO MANY more than that. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m guessing thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s over a hundred artists and writers represented in these ten volumes.\n\nAbsolutely classic works, presented beautifully. Not really much more to say than that.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f90b15af03d301a75f88cd8a4dfb26c65df2e44d","amp;dn":"Eerie+Archives+Vol+1-10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f90b15af03d301a75f88cd8a4dfb26c65df2e44d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,11,21,175,3,211,1,167,95,136,205,138,77,251,38,198,93,242,228,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
