He delighted in cloaking his writing behind a variety of literary personas, and Richard Saunders remains one of his most beloved, although some critics have complained that Poor Richard reveals the shallow materialism at the heart of Franklin's homespun philosophy and, by extension, at the heart of America itself. The Almanack holds a central place in understanding Franklin and his evolution from humble tradesman to founding father as well as providing a fascinating window into colonial America. Franklin's sharp wit still retains its ability to surprise and delight readers today.\n\nNarrated by Robert Bethune \n\nLENGTH: 9 hrs and 39 mins\nAUDIBLE RELEASE DATE: 10-10-11\nPUBLISHER: Freshwater Seas\nPublisher: Peter Pauper Press Inc,US\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0880889187\nISBN-13: 978-0880889186\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
