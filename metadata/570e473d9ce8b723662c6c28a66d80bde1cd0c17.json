It's got to rank as one of her best ever. She insisted that all the guest artists sing live with her in-studio, rather than recording their parts separately, (a request which she said threw Don Henley at first), and I think this adds a bit of a spark to the performances. The Redhead herself sounds simply wonderful. Absolutely nobody sounds or sings like she does.\n\nLeAnn Rimes kicks things off into high gear with &quot;When You Love Someone Like That&quot;, as older woman Reba helps her recover from a broken heart. Reba and Trisha Yearwood do a great Country turn with &quot;She Can't Save Him&quot;. And Reba &amp; Rascal Flatts blend so beautifully together on &quot;Faith in Love&quot; that it could go for radio adds tomorrow, and be a smash. And speaking of smashes, there's the Kelly Clarkson duet, &quot;Because of You&quot;, a true triumph for both women.\n\nNobody does a story song like Reba, and there are two terrific ones here. Listen to Reba and Kenny Chesney tell the story of a broken marriage as they exchange their children, &quot;Every Other Weekend&quot;. And Faith Hill and Reba tear it up as two neighbors fearing for their policeman/soldier husbands, and &quot;Sleeping With The Telephone.&quot;\n\nThere are wonderful turns by Vince Gill, Don Henley, Carole King, and a beautiful ballad with Justin Timberlake, &quot;The Only Promise That Remains&quot;. But my favorite is the most &quot;Country&quot; song on the album. Years ago, Reba wrote a little. Her earliest albums contain a few of her songs. Ronnie Dunn of Brooks and Dunn insisted she write with him for this project, and the result is &quot;Does The Wind Still Blow in Oklahoma&quot;, as two Okies, stranded in the wilds of California, call home to their parents to tell them they've found each other. Stone Cold Country, and simply great.\n\nThis is the last album on Reba's MCA contract. If she doesn't re-sign with them, you can be sure she went out with a bang. And no matter where she next hangs her musical hat, let's hope Reba Duets II is part of the plan.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nReba McEntire - Reba Duets\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
