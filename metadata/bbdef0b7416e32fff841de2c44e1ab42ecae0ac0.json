The music of Soapkills quickly became the soundtrack to the vibrant, young arts scene which developed in postwar Lebanon, the band gradually acquired an emblematic status and, to this day, Yasmine is considered as an undergound icon throughout the Arab world.\n\nYasmine moved to Paris a few years ago, and started working with Mirwais (who was part of French electronic new wave band Taxi Girl in the 80s, and produced/co-wrote MadonnaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“MusicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as well as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“American LifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ album). Under the Y.A.S. moniker, Yasmine and Mirwais recorded the Ã¢â‚¬Å“ArabologyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ album, which came out in 2009.\n\nAfter collaborating with CocoRosie for a while, Yasmine teamed up with Nouvelle Vague mastermind Marc Collin to create her debut solo album, a mesmerizing self-titled opus entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ya NassÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nIn order to write the melodies and the lyrics for these songs, Yasmine drew from the repertoire and the attitude of great Arab women singers from the middle of the 20th century, including some little-known or half-forgotten figures, such as Aisha El Marta, Nagat El Saghira, Asmahan, Shadia, Mounira El Mehdeyya and many more. Yasmine (who is an avid collector of records from that era) is inspired by these women, by the mischievous sensuality and the subtle, ironic social criticism which pervades their lyrics, and which is reminiscent of a period of freedom and emancipation in the history of Middle-Eastern societies.\n\nWhile YasmineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals are definitely connected to traditions of Arabic music (to which she takes a personal, unconventional and fresh approach), the structures and arrangements of the songs are very remote from its codes. They might be described as a kind of elegant, mutant strain of electro folk pop, mysteriously springing from somewhere in the Persian GulfÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ with acoustic guitars, vintage synths, spellbinding atmospheres and YasmineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s multi-faceted, wonderful voice.\n\nOne element which may be lost to our Western ears is YasmineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s playful use of various dialects of Arabic in her lyrics, which alternate between Lebanese, Kuwaiti, Palestinian, Egyptian and Bedouin, and use a lot of the code-switching and references so typical of Middle-Eastern humour.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbdef0b7416e32fff841de2c44e1ab42ecae0ac0","amp;dn":"Yasmine+Hamdan+-+2013+-+Ya+Nass","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbdef0b7416e32fff841de2c44e1ab42ecae0ac0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,222,240,183,65,110,50,255,248,65,222,44,68,225,171,66,236,174,10,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
