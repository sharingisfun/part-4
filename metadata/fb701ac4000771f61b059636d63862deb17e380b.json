He was born in Winnipeg and was a member of Chad Allen &amp; the Expressions, which evolved into the Guess Who, the most successful Canadian rock band of the 1960s.\n\nHe left the Guess Who in July 1970, made a solo album, Axe, and then formed Brave Belt, which evolved by 1972 into Bachman-Turner Overdrive (BTO). He left BTO in April 1977, made a second solo album, Survivor (1978), and then launched a new band, Ironhorse, in 1979, but was back touring with the Guess Who in 1983 and then with BTO by 1984.\n\nAnother solo album, Any Road, was released on Guitar Recordings in 1993. The live Every Song Tells a Story appeared in 2002 from True North, followed by JazzThing in 2004 from Maximum Jazz. The Bachman Cummings Songbook saw the light in 2006. Also in 2006, Bachman issued a collection of unreleased Bachman Cummings project songs (originally recorded in 1987) dubbed The Thunderbird Trax.\n\nIn 2007, another jazz-flavored release (JazzThing II) was issued, along with the Bachman Cummings cover album Jukebox. A DVD document of Bachman's July 7, 2007, live performance at the Montreal Jazz Festival was issued in July of 2008. For the 2008 holidays, Bachman released an album of Christmas favorites (Takin' Care of Christmas) -- with the titular track being a reworked version of the BTO classic &quot;Takin' Care of Business.&quot;\n\n\nRandy Bachman Official Site\n\n\n\n\n\n2015 Heavy Blues\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.

We Need To Talk\n\nLabel: Linus Entertainment\n\n\nRandy Bachman is that guy from that famous band that bears his last name, Bachman Turner Overdrive. In fact, he played the guitar solos, wrote most of their biggest hits and even sang several of their classic tunes.  Before that he was the guitar player and a songwriter for the iconic band The Guess Who.  In-between there was a band called Brave Belt, but we don't talk about that one so much... you know how it goes being in a rock band, sometimes you hit and sometimes you miss.\n\nBachman is back with a new album and power trio band that just uses his last name.  This time around, the music is a 'hit' even though there is no 'Turner' or 'Overdrive' to be found!  It's easy to guess who all of this is about!  This is Randy Bachman showing off 11 new tunes that he wrote and recorded with a couple of cool rocker chicks.  Anna Ruddick is a bad-ass low end grooving bass player, while drummer Dale Anne Brendon lays down a beat that allows the old man with the white beard to crank up big chords and melodic solos!\n\nOkay, Randy and the Rocker Chicks (a sexist name for sure, but a cool one indeed) are not trying to relive the glory days of BTO.  They are, however, staying very true to what Bachman's fans love about him, which are those huge bombastic chords and melodic guitar solos.\n\nThey do, kinda sorta--well, letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s be honest... REALLY out front and in your faceÃ¢â‚¬â€rip-off the Who on the opening number &quot;The Edge.&quot; Then again, this is rock and roll and this is Randy Bachman.  If he wants to jam on some Who-type chords and mix in his own brand of Bachman Turner Overdrive classic stylings over it, then I say, &quot;Let him do so!&quot;  There, it has been written and recorded, so let it be done!  Truth be told, the Who influence works for this track!  The tune starts off the album, sets the tone and the pace and the other tracks have to work hard to follow!\n\nBachman had a plan for that scenario, however... he simply invited some of his close buddies along for the ride, to add their own awesome sauce to the mix.  When you're talking Randy Bachman, then you're talking some pretty important rock and roll dudes.  Neil Young, who has known Randy since the good ole days of the 1960s, sits in on &quot;Little Girl.&quot;  Peter Frampton adds a guitar to the title track, and the second best song on the album, I might add.  Joe Bonamassa chimes in on some serious blues/rock riffage on &quot;Bad Child.&quot;  Robert Randolph, one of best lap-steel soloists around shines on &quot;Oh My Lord.&quot;  Bachman called in the Rival Son guitarist to guest on &quot;Ton of Bricks&quot; as well.  &quot;Confessin' to the Devil&quot; is a song that Randy has had for a while, and this album gives him the opportunity to release it.  What makes the song extra special is the solo performed by the late, great Jeff Healey.\n\nAll in all, this is a solid slab of rock and roll.  It's 100% Randy Bachman with a kick-ass backing band and loads of big names thrown in for good measure.  The songs could easily have been reworked and released as a Bachman Turner album, but instead, the Seventy-Something year old guitarist wanted to do this one himself.  At the end of the day, it worked.  It is indeed something of a trip back in a time machine, but when it comes to Randy Bachman that's a damn good thing!  I would rather hear him staying true to himself, playing his own version of the styles that influenced him and having a good time than hearing him attempt to be 'relevant' in a music business that doesn't give a damn about stuff like that anymore.  Leave it to Bachman to have a do-it-yer-self attitude, crank it up to 11 and rock out in 2015.\n\nCRR gives Bachman a 'hell yeah&quot; for effort alone; the fact that this thing rocks is icing on the cake!\n\nGenre:\tRock\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t105.85 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n11 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb701ac4000771f61b059636d63862deb17e380b","amp;dn":"Bachman+-+Heavy+Blues+2015+ak4352","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb701ac4000771f61b059636d63862deb17e380b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,112,26,196,0,7,113,246,27,5,150,54,214,56,98,222,177,126,56,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
