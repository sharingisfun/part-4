Maybe you found a better hosting service, got your own domain name, or maybe youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re finally ready to move to production. This course offers an advanced way to migrate a WordPress site from one location to another by duplicating and resetting the database. Let Morten Rand-Hendriksen guide you through the five steps of migration, and get you up and running in your new location.\n\nNote: This method creates a new duplicate of the original website, but it requires detailed database work and effectively results in a hard reset of the target site. Proceed carefully.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f32fb7071af9515562c279ebd32598734fa62364","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+WordPress+Quick+Tips%3A+Migration+and+Database+Reset","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f32fb7071af9515562c279ebd32598734fa62364","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,47,183,7,26,249,81,85,98,194,121,235,211,37,152,115,79,166,35,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
