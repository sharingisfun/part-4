Indeed, while Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry and Buddy Holly laid the groundwork, the Beatles forever defined the musical and artistic boundaries by which all future pop players would be judged. Indeed, the DVD format has provided modern day audiences with a chance to see why the Fab Four&amp;#039;s legacy is something much more significant than a mere history lesson. &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot; (released April 1, 2003 on DVD) picks up where the 2002-issued collector&amp;#039;s edition release of &quot;A Hard Day&amp;#039;s Night&quot; left off, providing more insight into the minds and music of the band that put Liverpool on the map. In addition to the in-depth chronology taking viewers on a magical mystery trip through the 1960s, new and never-before-seen material features interviews with Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and the late George Harrison at Abbey Road Studios in May 1995 as they listen to classic Beatles tracks with producer George Martin. The jewel of the release is additional footage of the three one-time mop tops jamming together in George Harrison&amp;#039;s garden.\n\nDVD extras? You get them here. Indeed, the DVD release features a bonus disc featuring approximately 80 minutes of material more than the deluxe, eight-volume VHS release that expanded on the ABC special broadcast on Nov. 19, 22 and 23, 1995. Needless to say, all fans of rock music and 20th century pop culture should own this collection.\n\nDisc One:\nPart I: July &amp;#039;40 to March &amp;#039;63\nPart II: March &amp;#039;63 to February &amp;#039;64\n\nDisc Two:\nPart III: February &amp;#039;64 to July &amp;#039;64\nPart IV: August &amp;#039;64 to August &amp;#039;65\n\nDisc Three:\nPart V: August &amp;#039;65 to July &amp;#039;66\nPart VI: July &amp;#039;66 to June &amp;#039;67\n\nDisc Four:\nPart VII: June &amp;#039;67 to July &amp;#039;68\nPart VIII: July &amp;#039;68 to The End\n\nDisc Five: Special Features\n* Recollections - June 1994\n* Compiling the Anthology Albums\n* Back At Abbey Road - May 1995\n* Recording &quot;Free as a Bird&quot; and &quot;Real Love&quot;\n* Production Team\n* Making the &quot;Free As A Bird&quot; Video\n* &quot;Real Love&quot; Vide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:194cb444242878669d031926d9461af6dd5d1908","amp;dn":"BEATLES.Anthology.2003.5Discs.DVD-Avbild","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"194cb444242878669d031926d9461af6dd5d1908","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,76,180,68,36,40,120,102,157,3,25,38,217,70,26,246,221,93,25,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
