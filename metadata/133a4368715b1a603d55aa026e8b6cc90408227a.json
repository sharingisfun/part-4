Since inception, the band has released numerous albums which are notable mainly due to Chris Impellitteri's speed/shred style of playing.\n\nContents\n\n1 Band history\n2 Beliefs\n3 Band members\n3.1 Former members\n4 Timeline\n5 Discography\n6 See also\n7 References\n8 Footnotes\n9 External links\n\nBand history\n\nChris Impellitteri formed Impellitteri together with Rob Rock in Los Angeles, California.[when?] They released an EP simply titled Impellitteri. The self-titled EP featured high energy energetic heavy metal with fast guitar solos. Vocalist for the EP was Rob Rock.\n\nAfter the EP the band regrouped, this time with Graham Bonnet as lead singer, and released A semi-tribute album to the more famous metal vocalists of the era titled Stand In Line. MTV played Impellitteri's music video for Stand In Line in its rotation, and Chris Impellitteri was a guest host on MTV's Headbanger's Ball. The fans voted Impellitteri a smash on MTV's Smash or Trash show featured during the release of the album. The album charted in Billboards top 100 and remained there for over 5 months. However, Impellitteri stated The Black EP was Impellitteri's style of music, and Stand in line was only intended to be a tribute to the legendary vocalists of the past's music, and not as a traditional Impellitteri metal shred record. Impellitteri has submitted copyright claims to YouTube for postings of live footage from this era.\n\nAfter some touring and label deals, Impellitteri returned (again with Rob Rock on vocals). They recorded and released the popular EP titled Victim of the System, which was produced by Mike Tacci who was the assistant engineer on Metallica's Black album. In late 1994, they released Answer to the Master.\n\nIn 1996, Impellitteri released Screaming Symphony. The record was mixed by highly-reputed producer Michael Wagener who had produced Metallica and Ozzy Osbourne in the past. The next year, they released another record titled: Eye of the Hurricane. In 2000 Impellitteri released Crunch.\n\nShortly after Crunch, Rob Rock decided to pursue a solo career and Impellitteri again recruited Graham Bonnet and began working on their next album. In 2002 they released System X. That year they also released a compilation of hits called The Very Best of Impellitteri: Faster Than the Speed of Light.\n\nThe reunion with Bonnet would be short-lived as they parted ways some time shortly thereafter. Impellitteri recruited Curtis Skelton, releasing Pedal to the Metal in 2004, displaying some of their most aggressive music to date.\n\nIn May 2008, it was announced that Rob Rock was, once again, back in Impellitteri. They collaborated on a new album called Wicked Maiden with a working title of Good and Evil.\n\nWicked Maiden was released in Japan and Europe on February 24, 2009,with the intent of releasing the new album in the United States in 2011, followed by the Impellitteri shredfest tour.[\nBand members\nVenom\nImpellitteri\n\nType:\nFull-length\nRelease date:\nMarch 4th, 2015\nCatalog ID:\nVICP-65294\n\nLabel:\nVictor Entertainment\nFormat:\nCD\nReviews:\nNone yet\n\nSongs\nLineup\nOther versions\nReviews\nAdditional notes\n\n1.
