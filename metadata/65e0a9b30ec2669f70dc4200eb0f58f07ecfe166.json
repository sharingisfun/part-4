Clarke - Odyssey Tetralogy 2001, 2010, 2061, 3001 (PDF)\n\nSri Lankabhimanya Sir Arthur Charles Clarke, CBE (16 December 1917 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 19 March 2008) was a British science fiction author, inventor, and futurist, most famous for the novel 2001: A Space Odyssey, written in collaboration with director Stanley Kubrick, a collaboration which also produced the film of the same name; and as a host and commentator in the British television series Mysterious World.\n\nClarke served in the Royal Air Force as a radar instructor and technician from 1941-1946, proposed satellite communication systems in 1945 which won him the Franklin Institute Stuart Ballantine Gold Medal in 1963. He was the chairman of the British Interplanetary Society from 1947-1950 and again in 1953. Later, he helped fight for the preservation of lowland gorillas. He won the UNESCO-Kalinga Prize for the Popularization of Science in 1961.\n\nClarke emigrated to Sri Lanka in 1956 largely to pursue his interest in scuba diving, and lived there until his death. He was knighted by the United Kingdom in 1998, and was awarded Sri Lanka's highest civil honour, Sri Lankabhimanya, in 2005.\n\n------\n\nBooks description (WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!)\n\n2001\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is a science fiction novel by Arthur C. Clarke. It was developed concurrently with Stanley Kubrick's film version and published after the release of the film. The story is based in part on various short stories by Clarke, most notably &quot;The Sentinel&quot; (written in 1948 for a BBC competition but first published in 1951 under the title &quot;Sentinel of Eternity&quot;). For an elaboration of Clarke and Kubrick's collaborative work on this project, see The Lost Worlds of 2001, Arthur C. Clarke, Signet, 1972.\n\nThe first part of the novel (in which aliens nudge the primitive human ancestors) is similar to the plot of an earlier Clarke story, &quot;Encounter in the Dawn&quot;.\n\nIn the background to the story in the book, an ancient and unseen alien race uses a mechanism with the appearance of a large crystalline monolith to investigate worlds all across the galaxy and, if possible, to encourage the development of intelligent life. The book shows one such monolith appearing in ancient Africa, three million years B.C., where it inspires a starving group of the hominid ancestors of human beings to conceive of tools. The ape-men use their tools to kill animals and eat meat, ending their starvation. They then use the tools to kill a leopard that had been preying on them; the next day, the main ape character, Moon-Watcher, uses a club to kill the leader of a rival tribe. Moon-Watcher reflects that though he is now master of the world, he is unsure of what to do nextÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but he will think of something. The book suggests that the monolith was instrumental in awakening intelligence, and enabling the transition of the ape-men to a higher order, with the ability to fashion crude tools and thereby be able to hunt and forage for food in a much more efficient fashion.\n\nThe book then leaps eons to the year 1999, detailing Dr. Heywood Floyd's travel to Clavius Base on the Moon. Upon his arrival, Floyd attends a meeting. A lead scientist explains that they have found a magnetic disturbance in Tycho, one of the Moon's craters, designated Tycho Magnetic Anomaly One, or TMA-1. An excavation of the area has revealed a large black slab; it is precisely fashioned to a ratio of exactly 1:4:9, or 1Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â²:2Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â²:3Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â²ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that is to say that the thickness of the slab is exactly 1/4th of its width and 1/9th of its height. Such a construction rules out any naturally-occurring phenomena, and at three million years of age, it was not crafted by human hands. It is the first evidence for the existence of extraterrestrial intelligent life. Floyd and a team of scientists drive across the moon to actually view TMA-1. They arrive just as sunlight hits upon it for the first time in three million years. It then sends a piercing radio transmission to the far reaches of the solar system. The signal is tracked to Iapetus, one of the many moons of Saturn, where an expedition is then planned to investigate...\n\n------\n\n2010\n\n\n2010: Odyssey Two is a best-selling science fiction novel by Arthur C. Clarke, which was published in January 1982. It is the sequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey and was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1983. The novel was adapted for the screen and released as a film in 1984.\n\nUnlike 2001: A Space Odyssey, the novel and the screenplay were not written simultaneously, and there are significant differences between the two. (A part of this novel has similarities with a much-older short story by Clarke, &quot;History Lesson&quot;; the plot involves superfast evolution on a world just made habitable.)\n\nIn both the book and the movie, the story is set nine years after the failure of the Discovery One mission to Jupiter. A joint Soviet-American crew, including Heywood Floyd from 2001, on the Soviet spaceship Alexei Leonov (named after the famous cosmonaut) arrives to discover what went wrong with the earlier mission, to investigate the monolith in orbit around the planet, and to resolve the disappearance of David Bowman. They hypothesize that much of this information is locked away on the now-abandoned Discovery One. The Soviets have an advanced new &quot;Sakharov&quot; drive which will propel them to Jupiter ahead of the American Discovery Two, so Floyd is assigned to the Leonov crew...\n\n------\n\n2061\n\n\n2061: Odyssey Three is a science fiction novel written by Arthur C. Clarke in 1987. It is the third book in the Space Odyssey series. Because the Odyssey series is closely concerned with Jupiter and its moons, Clarke had originally intended to delay writing a third book until the Galileo mission to the planet had returned its findings. However, the probe's launch was delayed in the aftermath of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster so that it would not arrive at Jupiter until 1995. Deciding not to wait, Clarke instead took his inspiration from the approach of Comet Halley in 1986 and focused his sequel on the comet's future return, in 2061.\n\nIn 2061, at the age of 103, Floyd is chosen as one of several &quot;celebrity guests&quot; to come aboard the spaceliner Universe for the first-ever human landing on the surface of Halley's Comet, which will shortly be making its periodic pass through the solar system. Meanwhile, a team of scientists on Ganymede are terraforming the moon. Scientist Rolf van der Berg, a second-generation Afrikaner refugee, studies pictures of Mount Zeus and determines that it is in fact one enormous diamond. He communicates his discovery to his uncle Paul Kreuger and decide that van der Berg will get aboard the Galaxy on its flyby of Europa to investigate...\n\n------\n\n3001\n\n\n3001: The Final Odyssey (1997) is a science fiction novel by Arthur C. Clarke. It is the fourth and final book in the Space Odyssey series. 3001 follows the adventures of Frank Poole, an astronaut who was deliberately killed by HAL 9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey. His body is discovered after drifting in space for a millennium and brought back to life, exposure to vacuum having preserved him sufficiently for the advanced medical technology of the time to be able to revive him. He then explores the Earth of 3001...\n\n------\nSources: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Clarke&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Clarke&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(novel)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(novel)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010:_Odyssey_Two&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010:_Odyssey_Two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2061:_Odyssey_Three&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2061:_Odyssey_Three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3001:_The_Final_Odyssey&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3001:_The_Final_Odyssey&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---\nProper: Books have been reformatted, covers have been embedded, and bookmarks fixed.\n---\nBrought to you by Dodecahedron.
