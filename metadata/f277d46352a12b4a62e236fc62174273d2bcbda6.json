You, however, can take control of the user experience with jQuery, and give your admins the ability to control the gallery with features they already know and love. Chris Converse teaches you how in this short course. Learn to register custom javascript, modify the layout with CSS, and then incorporate a lightbox effect.\nPlus, Chris will show you how to make the most of your hard work by moving the gallery markup between different WordPress themes, so you can use your customization in any layout.\n\n\nIntroduction 2m 22s\n-------------------\nPreview the final project 50s\nAbout the exercise files 45s\nA few assumptions (on my part) 47s\n\n1.
