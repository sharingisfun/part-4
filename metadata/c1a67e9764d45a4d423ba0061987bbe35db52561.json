I am into probably more of a New York freestyle sound - a harder more fierce sound.\n\nI would list them all here, but all the details are in the &quot;details&quot;.\n\nCompany B, Cover Girls, Coro, Expose, George Lamond, Sweet Sensation, TKA, Stevie B., Will To Power - just to name a few of the artists here.  Also a select few that never made it real big, but have that sound we all know and love :)\n\nI hope you all will enjoy and reseed as appropriate!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1a67e9764d45a4d423ba0061987bbe35db52561","amp;dn":"The+Very+Best+Of+Classic+Freestyle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1a67e9764d45a4d423ba0061987bbe35db52561","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,166,126,151,100,212,90,77,66,59,160,6,25,135,187,227,93,181,37,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
