He recently signed to ATO Records, which will release the easy-going musicianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut full-length album, feathers &amp; fishHoooks, on Aug. 28.\n\nRecorded in Nashville, feathers &amp; fishHooks was produced by Baxter, Eric Masse and Skylar Wilson (Justin Townes Earle, Caitlin Rose). Grammy-winning producer Jacquire King (Tom Waits, Modest Mouse) mixed and executive produced the album, which also features BaxterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father, Bucky, who has played with the likes of Bob Dylan, Steve Earle and Ryan Adams.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Making this record was effortless,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said Baxter. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The songs formed themselves; we started with no goals in mind other than making music that myself and everyone around me was moved by. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an emotional record that puts into words what I, or anyone longing for change, could go through.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b2f23c68c435c7fda02f402e88e4d5341e31c85","amp;dn":"Rayland+Baxter+-+Feathers+and+Fishhooks+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC+%2FWEB%5D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b2f23c68c435c7fda02f402e88e4d5341e31c85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,47,35,198,140,67,92,127,218,2,244,2,232,142,77,83,65,227,28,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
