Whether you lean towards the words of Jane Austen: &quot;Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure,&quot; or the advice of Paris Hilton: &quot;Dress cute wherever you go. Life is too short to blend in,&quot; the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations provides the ultimate answer to the questions &quot;Who said that?&quot; and &quot;What's been said about this?&quot; Drawing on Oxford's unrivalled dictionary research program and unique language monitoring, this Seventh Edition offers almost a thousand new quotations, from over 500 authors. These include classic quotations from established names for which new evidence of current usage has been found as well as earlier quotations used by well-known literary authors from around the English-speaking world, ranging from the maxim of Confucius for a ruler, &quot;If you desire what is good, the people will be good&quot; (quoted by Thoreau), and the view of the Stoic philosopher Epictetus that &quot;Not things, but opinions about things, trouble men&quot; (Laurence Sterne). \n\nNow featuring a ribbon-marker, enhanced cross-referencing, a new crystal-clear text design, and an expanded introduction, The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations is an invaluable addition to every home library as well as the working libraries of all professional speakers and writers.\n\nReview\n__\n\n\nReview from previous edition: &quot;A glorious treasure-house for browsers&quot; --Times Literary Supplement\n\n&quot;Every home should have a copy&quot; --Sunday Telegraph\n\n&quot;Invaluable&quot; --The Times\n\n&quot;Still the best&quot; --The Independent\n\n&quot;I could re-read it over and over again and never grow bored, for its pages contain all the insight of a library&quot; --Daily Mail\nAbout the Author\n\nA historical lexicographer, having previously worked on the 4th edition of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Elizabeth Knowles has had a long association with Oxford Quotations Dictionaries.
