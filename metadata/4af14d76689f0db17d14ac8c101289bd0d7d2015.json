Just unzip and play.\n\n\nProject Zomboid is an open-ended zombie-infested sandbox. It\nasks one simple question Ã¢â‚¬â€œ how will you die? \n\nIn the towns of Muldraugh and West Point, survivors must loot\nhouses, build defences and do their utmost to delay their\ninevitable death day by day. No help is coming Ã¢â‚¬â€œ your continued\nsurvival relies on your own cunning, luck and ability to evade\na relentless horde. \n\nFeatures:\n\nSandbox zombie survival game.\n\nFull line of sight system and real-time lighting, sound and\nvisibility mechanics. Hide in the shadows, keep quiet and keep\nthe lights off at night, or at least hang sheets over the\nwindows. \n\nVast and growing map (loosely based on a real world location)\nfor you to explore, loot and set up your fortress. Check out\nBlindcoderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s map project: http://pzmap.crash-override.net/ \n\nUse tools and items to craft weapons, barricade and cook. You\ncan even build zombie proof forts by chopping trees, sawing\nwood and scavenging supplies.\n\nDeal with depression, boredom, hunger, thirst and illness\nwhile trying to survive.\n\nDay turns to night. The electricity falters. Hordes migrate.\nWinter draws in. Society is in freefall.\n\nFarming, carpentry, character customization, skills and perks\nthat develop based on what you do in-game.\n\nHundreds of zombies with swarm mechanics and in-depth visual\nand hearing systems.\n\nProper zombies that donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t run. (Unless you tell them to in\nthe sandbox menu).\n\nA ton of amazing atmospheric music tracks by the prodigy\nthat is Zach Beever.\n\nInstant action Ã¢â‚¬ËœLast StandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ mode, on top of our Sandbox and\nSurvival.\n\nFull, open and powerful Lua modding support.\n\n\nSeed and enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4af14d76689f0db17d14ac8c101289bd0d7d2015","amp;dn":"Project+Zomboid+2.9.9.17+Build+21+%5BMAC%5D+%28Native%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4af14d76689f0db17d14ac8c101289bd0d7d2015","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,241,77,118,104,159,13,177,125,20,172,140,16,18,137,189,13,125,32,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
