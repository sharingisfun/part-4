The result is an explosive book that takes us, for the first time, deep inside a shadowy, fascinating, and surreal world of unscrupulous doctors, anything-goes team directors, and athletes so relentlessly driven to succeed that they would do anythingÃ¢â‚¬â€and take any risk, physical, mental, or moralÃ¢â‚¬â€to gain the edge they need to win.\n \nTyler Hamilton was once one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best-liked and top-ranked cyclistsÃ¢â‚¬â€a fierce competitor renowned among his peers for his uncanny endurance and epic tolerance for pain. In the 2003 Tour de France, he finished fourth despite breaking his collarbone in the early stagesÃ¢â‚¬â€and grinding eleven of his teeth down to the nerves along the way. He started his career with the U.S. Postal Service team in the 1990s and quickly rose to become Lance ArmstrongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most trusted lieutenant, and a member of his inner circle. For the first three of ArmstrongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s record seven Tour de France victories, Hamilton was by ArmstrongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s side, clearing his way. But just weeks after Hamilton reached his own personal pinnacleÃ¢â‚¬â€winning the gold medal at the 2004 OlympicsÃ¢â‚¬â€his career came to a sudden, ignominious end: He was found guilty of doping and exiled from the sport.\n\n\n                             Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                             Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n         **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n            Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23302a86ec2d43a9dd346877be8b455777d901fc","amp;dn":"The+Secret+Race+by+Tyler+Hamilton+and+Daniel+Coyle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23302a86ec2d43a9dd346877be8b455777d901fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,48,42,134,236,45,67,169,221,52,104,119,190,139,69,87,119,217,1,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
