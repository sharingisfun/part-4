Rainbolt, Sandra L. Dwyer | 2011 | 464 Pages | ISBN: 0495501573 | PDF | 7 MB\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nWith a complete, approachable presentation, CRITICAL THINKING: THE ART OF ARGUMENT is an accessible yet rigorous introduction to critical thinking. The text emphasizes immediate application of critical-thinking skills to real life. \nThe relevance of these skills is shown throughout the text by highlighting the advantages of basing one's decisions on a thoughtful understanding of arguments and presenting the overarching commonalities across arguments. \nWith its conversational writing style and carefully selected examples, the book employs a consistent and unified treatment of logical form and an innovative semiformal method of standardizing arguments \nthat illustrates the concept of logical form while maintaining a visible connection to ordinary speech. Without sacrificing accuracy or detail, the authors have clearly presented the material with appropriate study tools \nand exercises that emphasize application rather than memorization.\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;\n\n\nvisit me on facebook -  just Google &quot;TEAM NANBAN TPB&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70b88bf89d705533b51077481e958120b9fd2818","amp;dn":"Critical+Thinking-+The+Art+of+Argument%5BTeam+Nanban%5D%5BTPB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70b88bf89d705533b51077481e958120b9fd2818","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,184,139,248,157,112,85,51,181,16,119,72,30,149,129,32,185,253,40,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
