As the narrator of THE MAHABHARATA says, &quot;If you listen carefully, at the end, youll be somebody else.&quot; This interest in transformation that has characterized the latter part of Brooks career continues with this adaptation of the autobiography of famed mystic G.I. Gurdjieff, which stars Dragan Maksimovic. Driven by a sense of unwavering dedication to unraveling the meaning of human existence, he journeys throughout the most unattainable areas of the East, encountering an array of Hindu fakirs, Buddhist monks, whirling dervishes, and gurus of every stripe. In search of enlightenment, he climbs the Himalayas, walks across the desert on stilts, and uncovers evidence of an ancient order, guards of an arcane wisdom. Most fascinating, perhaps, is the form of dance he created as a form of meditation and later taught in the West. A film that may be best appreciated by those already familiar with the work of Gurdjieff, MEETINGS WITH REMARKABLE MEN features spectacular photography and a highly evocative score, incorporating various indigenous musics.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079542/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079542/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: Gurdjieff - Meetings with remarkable men.avi\nFilesize.....: 698 MB (or 715,004 KB or 732,164,096 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:42:53 (154,321 fr)\nVideo Codec..: DivX 5.0\nVideo Bitrate: 879 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) IDd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 64 kb/s, monophonic CBR\nFrame Size...: 448x336 (1.33:1) [=4:3]\nLanguage.....: English\n\n\n\ned2k://|file|Gurdjieff.-.Meetings.with.remarkable.men.avi|732164096|6545CF9A9BD76C242434E317C6BC1787|/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e34d250db0de73fde2be531f90c4af654600343","amp;dn":"Gurdjieff+-+Meetings+With+Remarkable+Men+%281978%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e34d250db0de73fde2be531f90c4af654600343","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,52,210,80,219,13,231,63,222,43,229,49,249,12,74,246,84,96,3,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
