Director Mario Andreacchio later said:\n&quot;Fair Game came out of a situation where we were wanting to make a movie that was a B-grade video suspense thriller. I wanted to treat it like comic book violence - it was always like a comic book study of violence. What amazed me and the thing I found quite disappointing was that it started to become a cult film in some parts of the world and people were taking it seriously. And that, for me, became a real turning point. I thought, if people are taking this seriously, then I don't think I can make this sort of material.&quot;\n\nA young woman running a wildlife sanctuary in the Australian outback is in for trouble when she is confronted by three kangaroo hunters. Bored with killing kangaroos, they decide to kill the animals in the sanctuary, and when they see how attractive the owner is, they decide to have a little fun with her, too. Turns out that they may get a bit more fun than they bargained for.\n\n\nVideo: XviD, 704x400, 25.000 fps, 1000 kbps, 01h22m21s\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 192 kbps\n\n[dual audio tracks, both the same, don't know why, make sure player just uses one]\n\nDVD Rip, English audio\noptional subtitles in Czech, Hungarian, Portuguese-BR, Serbian\n\nscreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HaANgaagP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HaANgaagP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HAAnhaaGP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HAAnhaaGP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HAanjaagP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HAanjaagP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HaankAAGp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HaankAAGp&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOriginally posted at RL, November 2012.
