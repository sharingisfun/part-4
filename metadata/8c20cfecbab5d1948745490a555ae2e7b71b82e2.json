While the trio\nrevitalizes the standard &quot;Out of Nowhere&quot; and breezes through Benny Golson's\njazz classic &quot;Along Came Betty,&quot; the fireworks really get under way on\n&quot;Highjack.&quot; The tune signals the fervent arrival of its composer, guitarist\nJames Blood Ulmer, and by the conclusion the quartet is joined by fiery\nmulti-saxophonist Hamiett Bluiett. Carter and Bluiett then take center stage for\na baritone sax duet on &quot;Song for Camile,&quot; Bluiett's beautiful ballad initially\nrecorded with the World Saxophone Quartet, of which he is a member, on their\norgan-drenched 1995 date Breath of Life. Ulmer directs the proceedings through\nChicago blues territory with a quick and loose &quot;Little Red Rooster,&quot; which leads\ninto R. Kelly's 1996 pop hit &quot;I Believe I Can Fly.&quot; Now, before indifference\ngets the best of you, in the hands of these musicians the tune receives a quick\nconversion from ballad into a quasi-Latin groove, through burning funk -- in\nwhich Gibbs absolutely shines -- and finally the reeds irreverently take it out\nhonking and squawking in a manner that would have made Lester Bowie smile. Like\nits predecessor, Live at Baker's Keyboard Lounge, Out of Nowhere provides an\nadmirable cornucopia of modern jazz from Carter and friends.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c20cfecbab5d1948745490a555ae2e7b71b82e2","amp;dn":"James+Carter+Organ+Trio+-+Out+Of+Nowhere+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c20cfecbab5d1948745490a555ae2e7b71b82e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,32,207,236,186,181,209,148,135,69,73,10,85,90,226,231,183,27,130,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
