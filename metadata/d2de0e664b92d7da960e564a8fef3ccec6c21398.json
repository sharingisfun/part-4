As it turns out, two thirds of Miike Snow (producers Christian Karlsson and Pontus Winnberg, otherwise known as Bloodshy &amp; Avant) are the same gentlemen who co-wrote and/or produced a good amount of material by the ladies mentioned above, including SpearsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ megahit Ã¢â‚¬Å“ToxicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nTherein lies the importance of separate branding, young reader.\n\nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking for a brand this week that makes aurally pleasing sequences of bleeps, bloops, keys, horns, sighs, Ã¢â‚¬Å“oohsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“wahhhsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“aahsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, then look no further than Miike SnowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest product on the market, Happy to You. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the aggressively haunting sophomore effort from the same ensemble that put together 2010Ã¢â‚¬Â²s terrific eponymous debut, and although it came out the last week of march, Happy sounds like it wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be sad if winter decided to last another few months.\n\nThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not to say itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a sad album though; although it has its somber moments, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largely a lighthearted effort.\n\nOkay, I just made that up. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really know what this album is about. Most of the lyrics areÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ cryptic. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not even going to take a stab at it. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lot of symbolismÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ probablyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and some spiritual imageryÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ references to pharaohs and stuffÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and some nice juxtaposition ofÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ thingsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Yeah, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not even going to try. I would give them the benefit of a doubt and assume that the lyrical complexity matches the production expertise, but I kind of think Karlsson, Winnberg, and lead singer Andrew Wyatt just enjoy keeping their listeners guessing.\n\nAfter watching the two music videos that accompany this album so far, I really donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m wrong.\n\nAnd hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the explanation.\n\nAfter watching the videos, I have to agree that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re high on vivid imagery and low on clarity, which seems to be the intent. I think the same can be said for the album as a whole too. Karlsson and Winnberg are experts at Making Things Sound Good, so donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be surprised when these songs stick with you well after you turn everything off. The music is, again, haunting. The French horns in Ã¢â‚¬Å“DevilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s WorkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ rattle the sternum with their severity; Donnie DarkoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rabbit friend Frank seems to make an appearance in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Black Tin BoxÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bavarian #1 (Say You Will)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ invades your ear with the battle driven rat-a-tat of a snare, a bass line that mimics every movement of a plucky key ensemble, and WyattÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soft but penetrating vocals. All that said, I really donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know if thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s much of an overarching theme tying the content together. This isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t necessarily a bad thing, and of course I could just be wrong, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s certainly worth mentioning.\n\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m hesitant to say much more about this album as it still seems like a bit of a work in progress, especially considering WinnbergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hinting at the continuation of the Alien Children Use Big-Nosed Stepford Men in Shiny Pants to Ruin the World video series. CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait.\n\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve found that I enjoy Happy to You more with each listen, which is no doubt a testament to its earworm quality. And I seriously canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait for the next videos in the series Ã¢â‚¬â€ first, because the imagery is phenomenal, and second, because WHAT IS HAPPENING?!?!?\n\nI guess weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find out soon. Or not.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2de0e664b92d7da960e564a8fef3ccec6c21398","amp;dn":"Miike+Snow+i+-+Happy+To+You+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2de0e664b92d7da960e564a8fef3ccec6c21398","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,222,14,102,75,146,215,218,150,14,86,74,143,239,60,206,198,194,19,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
