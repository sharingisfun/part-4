You no longer\n\nhave to fantasize about being a goat, your dreams have\n\nfinally come true! WASD to write history\n\n\n\nGameplay-wise, Goat Simulator is all about causing as much\n\ndestruction as you possibly can as a goat. It has been\n\ncompared to an old-school skating game, except instead of\n\nbeing a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks\n\nyou wreck stuff. Destroy things with style, such as doing a\n\nbackflip while headbutting a bucket through a window, and\n\nyou'll earn even more points! Or you could just give Steam\n\nWorkshop a spin and create your own goats, levels\n\nmissions, and more! When it comes to goats, not even the\n\nsky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it\n\nand crash the game\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Goat Simulator is a completely stupid game\n\nand, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on\n\nsomething else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or\n\nmaybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a\n\nreal goat\n\n\n\nKey Features\n\n\n\nYou can be a goat\n\nGet points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends\n\nthat you're the alpha goat\n\nSteam Workshop support - make your own goats, levels\n\nmissions, game modes, and more!\n\nMILLIONS OF BUGS! We're only eliminating the crash-bugs\n\neverything else is hilarious and we're keeping it\n\nIn-game physics that spazz out all the time\n\nSeriously look at that goat's neck\n\nYou can be a goat\n\n\n\n1. Unpack release\n\n2. Install the update to where you installed the game\n\n3. Copy the cracked content from /Crack dir to the\n\nsame place\n\n4. Enjoy! ;)\n\n\n\nWE DONT WANT ANYONE TO CONTACT US!\n\nWE CONTACT YOU IF NEEDED!\n\nWEB: NEVER - IRC: NEVER - EMAIL: NEVER\n\n\n\nGreetings to all of our friends around scene!\n\n\n\nNFO UPDATED 13/11/2007","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ac3c47dadd9399c237c56c50b2c5a7cade16a31","amp;dn":"Goat.Simulator.Update.v1.1.28847-BAT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ac3c47dadd9399c237c56c50b2c5a7cade16a31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,195,196,125,173,217,57,156,35,124,86,197,11,44,90,124,173,225,106,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
