However, most CSS3 guides focus primarily on the basics, frustrating web developers who want to do sophisticated work. Learning CSS3 Animations and Transitions is the first book focused entirely on creating production-quality rich animations and transitions with CSS3. Leading web development trainer Alexis Goldstein covers everything web developers need to know, teaching through solid examples that help web professionals build their skills one step at a time. Readers will learn how to: * Create 2D transforms that serve as the foundation for CSS3 animations * Use transitions to make changes come alive * Master essential keyframing techniques * Combine transitions, transforms, and parallax scrolling in immersive web experiences * Transform in 3D, and animate 3D transforms * Creating increasingly complex and Flash-style animations * Build powerfully effective interactive infographics with CSS3 and HTML5 * And much more...\n\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
