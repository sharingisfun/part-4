With guest judges Leah Remini (The King of Queens) and Lainie Kazan (My Big Fat Greek Wedding).\n\nJust when you thought you knew what to expect from RuPaul's Drag Race, along comes the ferociously fabulous and funny Season Six, with enough tricks up its silk chiffon sleeve to keep you on your painted toes! This crop of queens is our most diverse yet, from seasoned pros, to an international drag star, to a former American Idol contestant, and even some fresh-faced ingenue queens who were inspired to be drag performers by watching Season One of RuPaul's Drag Race! That's one leggy legacy. Have we mentioned that these boys are hot? Because they are. Have we mentioned they make even hotter women? Because they do.\n\n\nEpisode: 07 - Glamazon By Colorevolution, Untucked!\n---------------------------------------------------\nOne of the queens is heartbroken when her idol reads her look.\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked! is the access-all-areas pass to the drama that you didn't see on the runway- the backstage bitchiness, the catfights, the struggles, the tears and the secrets. See what happens behind the scenes when the queens let their tucks breathe... and let their emotions flow. Will the drag queens crack under the pressure of competing to become America's next drag superstar? RuPaul narrates us through the trials and tribulations of what happens when a gaggle of queens are up against each other... and themselves.\n\nTechnical:\n----------\nResolution: HD 1080p (High Definition Shade)\nVideo Codec: H264 MP4\nAudio Codec: AAC Stereo 48000Hz\nRating: TVMA - Mature Audience Only (Uncensored)\n\nGreetings:\n----------\nBarbara, PLEASE.
