From the '80s on, his work became increasingly theatrical as he moved into acting and composing. Growing up in Southern California, Waits attracted the attention of manager Herb Cohen, who also handled Frank Zappa, and was signed by him at the beginning of the 1970s, resulting in the material later released as The Early Years and The Early Years, Vol. 2. His formal recording debut came with Closing Time (1973) on Asylum Records, an album that contained &quot;Ol' 55,&quot; which was covered by labelmates the Eagles for their On the Border album. Waits attracted critical acclaim and a cult audience for his subsequent albums, The Heart of Saturday Night (1974), the two-LP live set Nighthawks at the Diner (1975), Small Change (1976), Foreign Affairs (1977), Blue Valentine (1978), and Heart Attack and Vine (1980). His music and persona proved highly cinematic, and, starting in 1978, he launched parallel careers as an actor and as a composer of movie music. He wrote songs for and appeared in Paradise Alley (1978), wrote the title song for On the Nickel (1980), and was hired by director Francis Coppola to write the music for One from the Heart (1982), which earned him an Academy Award nomination. While working on that project, Waits met and married playwright Kathleen Brennan, with whom he later collaborated.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1 Brawlers\n\n\n01.Lie To Me\n02.Low Down\n03.219\n04.Fish In The Jailhouse\n05.Bottom Of The World\n06.Lucinda\n07.Ain't Goin' Down To The Well\n08.Lord I've Been Changed\n09.Puttin' On The Dog\n10.Road To Peace\n11.All The Time\n12.The Return Of Jackie And Judy\n13.Walk Away\n14.Sea Of Love\n15.Buzz Fledderjohn\n16.Rains On Me\n\n\nDisc 2 Bawlers\n\n\n01.Bend Down The Branches\n02.You Can Never Hold Back Spring\n03.Long Way Home\n04.Widow's Grove\n05.Little Drop Of Poison\n06.Shiny Things\n07.World Keeps Turning\n08.Tell It To Me\n09.Never Let Go\n10.Fannin Street\n11.Little Man\n12.It's Over\n13.If I Have To Go\n14.Goodnight Irene\n15.The Fall Of Troy\n16.Take Care Of All My Children\n17.Down There By The Train\n18.Danny Says\n19.Jayne's Blue Wish\n20.Young At Heart\n\n\nDisc 3 Bastards\n\n\n01.What Keeps Mankind Alive\n02.Children's Story\n03.Heigh Ho\n04.Army Ants\n05.Books Of Moses\n06.Bone Chain\n07.Two Sisters\n08.First Kiss\n09.Dog Door\n10.Redrum\n11.Nirvana\n12.Home I'll Never Be\n13.Poor Little Lamb\n14.Altar Boy\n15.The Pontiac\n16.Spidey's Wild Ride\n17.King Kong\n18.On The Road\n19.Dog Treat\n20.Missing My Son\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n              ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3873d60c3882ad1d11734cd8e5e3f69a785b499e","amp;dn":"Tom+Waits+-+Orphans%3A+Brawlers+Bawlers+Bastards+%282006%29+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3873d60c3882ad1d11734cd8e5e3f69a785b499e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,115,214,12,56,130,173,29,17,115,76,216,229,227,246,154,120,91,73,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
