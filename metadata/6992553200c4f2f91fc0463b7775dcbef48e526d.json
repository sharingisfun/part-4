While some tracks do seem to ape the era's grunge ethos a bit too slavishly, there's also a sense that perhaps Weiland and company were merely sharing some of the same influences as their contemporaries--and on standouts like the riff-savvy &quot;Sex Type Thing&quot; and the moody acoustics of &quot;Creep&quot;, accomplishing it with a bit more ambitious range. Indeed, the radio anthem &quot;Crush&quot; belies a devotion to songcraft disdained by many of their peers, one that served as an effective bridge between the stadium rock of the '70s and '80s and the more introspective alt-rock just then coming into vogue--even if the album's triple-platinum sales showed just how ironic and misplaced the &quot;alternative&quot; label could ultimately be. --Jerry McCulley\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Dead &amp; bloated                                       [05:10]\n02.Sex type thing                                       [03:39]\n03.Wicked garden                                        [04:05]\n04.No memory                                            [01:20]\n05.Sin                                                  [06:05]\n06.Naked sunday                                         [03:49]\n07.Creep                                                [05:33]\n08.Piece of pie                                         [05:25]\n09.Plush                                                [05:14]\n10.Wet my bed                                           [01:37]\n11.Crackerman                                           [03:14]\n12.Where the river goes                                 [08:26]\n________\n53:37 min\n 91,0 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
