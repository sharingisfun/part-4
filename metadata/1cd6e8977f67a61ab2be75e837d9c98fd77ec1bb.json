With conversations covering everything from alienation to alcoholism, Spheeris talks to teens living on the street or squatting in abandoned buildings. Other individuals interviewed include an unstable mother, an LAPD officer, and a paralyzed youth living on a disability. Winner of the &quot;Freedom of Expression&quot; Award at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival.&quot;\n\n- Bhob Stewart, Rovi\n\nNY Times review: http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A00E2DC1F39F934A35754C0A9669C8B63","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cd6e8977f67a61ab2be75e837d9c98fd77ec1bb","amp;dn":"The+Decline+of+Western+Civilization+3+%5BAVI%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cd6e8977f67a61ab2be75e837d9c98fd77ec1bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,214,232,151,127,103,166,26,178,190,117,232,55,217,201,143,215,126,193,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
