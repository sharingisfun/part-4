Sure, the first time someone heard Korn, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure they were pleased to know Limp Bizkit existed, too, but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d argue the experience was not quite as rich as when, say, Explosion in the SkyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Earth is Not a Cold Dead Place introduced untold thousands to post-rock, which led many of those to Mogwai or to an appreciation for instrumental music, generally. Keith Kenniff, who writes and records separately as Helios and Goldmund, is an artist whose work benefits from this experience, attracting fans through film and commercial composition, aesthetic proximity to artists like Peter Broderick, Hauschka and Balmorhea, or through good oleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fashioned word-of-mouth. However you found him, Famous Places is well-worth the journey, at once a piano-based ambient record of complex beauty and another moving statement of modern classicalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relevance in our decentralized music culture.\nGoldmundÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first two LPs, Courduroy Road and The Malady of Elegance, were sparse affairs featuring Kenniff as both composer and historian. Influenced by American Civil War folk music and classic European film, both albums were external narratives put to slow-burning melodies that ached with solemnity and reverence for times and people past. Though the concept of a solo piano album is hardly new, Kenniff brought to the genre a unique comprehension of space and texture, weaving subtle electronic and ambient touches into his affective, nostalgic compositions. To be sure, Famous Places is not a stark departure from these records in style or scope, but this time the lens is turned inwardly on the composer, himself. According to Western Vinyl, the boutique label charged with releasing the album, Ã¢â‚¬Å“the track titles are reflective of landmarks in KenniffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life that he uses as a theme to base his compositions on, punctuating memories of childhood, love, and loss.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nWhile the songs on Famous Places are poignant regardless of context Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for me, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve not been moved by such elegant simplicity since Dustin OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢HalloranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Piano Solos Vol. 2 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ this aesthetic personalization gives the album an enhanced character. Modern technology makes the experience richer, too; Google images of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fort McClaryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ while listening to the song and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll easily find where his adoration for geographic beauty and historical profundity collide. However, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not to suggest the album is overly earnest, as its purely instrumental construction and spartan song titles insulate us from knowing how deep into KenniffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s willing to let us go, which is part of the recordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s charm. Indeed, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to think he titled songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pine ViewÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ is it a suburb, forest, housing division, mall, church? Ã¢â‚¬â€ so they could be co-opted by his listeners, giving us the freedom to apply our own sense of memory to these localities. By sourcing ballroom tracks from the 1920s, James Leyland Kirby worked with similar intention on his haunting Persistent Repetition of Phrases album. Here, Kenniff matches that work in emotional complexity, displacing KirbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s use of sunless, sampled loops for original piano compositions that invoke feelings both mournful and optimistic.\n\nIf weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re honest, the constant drone of online indie rock chatter can be as vapid and time-consuming as the din of a million Perrys and Gagas, leaving music fans little energy to appreciate artists like Goldmund. So, where do records like Famous Places fit in? They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. And, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the beauty of a genre so totally lacking in self-awarenessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more narcissistic tendencies. No, this recordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home is beside HammockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Chasing After ShadowsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Living With the Ghosts, Max RichterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Infra or BalmorheaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Constellations, profound compositional works released in 2010 that have largely gone unnoticed as publications saved space for bands that will be long-forgotten this time next year. Sure, these songs may find a home in film, TV or commercials, but Kenniff will remain only slightly more recognizable than a typical Oxford-wearing Berklee grad, slowly collecting on his talent as countless buzz bands come-and-go. Something tells me he and his fans like it this way, fans that Ã¢â‚¬â€œ thanks to the slope Ã¢â‚¬â€œ will forever stand by each new quiet accomplishment, of which Famous Places sits amongst his best.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:830b9cae61057c1c94385edefb1f7d520d660d8b","amp;dn":"Goldmund+-+Famous+Places+%5B2010%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"830b9cae61057c1c94385edefb1f7d520d660d8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,11,156,174,97,5,124,28,148,56,94,222,251,31,125,82,13,102,13,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
