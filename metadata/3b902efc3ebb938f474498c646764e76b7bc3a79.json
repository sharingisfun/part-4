You play as a nameless adventurer attempting to escape a living, magical dungeon that reconstructs itself each time you play, with only one way out - down. Craft, equip, explore, and fight to stay alive as you delve deeper and face ever-greater threats in the twisting halls and endless chasms of the NECROPOLIS. Have no doubt, youâ€™re going to die - often! - but youâ€™ll improve your combat skills, available upgrades, and dungeon know-how with every playthrough, bringing you one step closer to the exit. \r\n(Warning: â€œJust one more timeâ€ mindset can be addicting.)\r\n\r\nFor more info go to : https://www.gog.com/game/necropolis\r\n\r\n-Install\r\n-Play","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b902efc3ebb938f474498c646764e76b7bc3a79","amp;dn":"Necropolis-GOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b902efc3ebb938f474498c646764e76b7bc3a79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,144,46,252,62,187,147,143,71,68,152,198,70,118,78,118,183,188,58,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
