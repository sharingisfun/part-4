This software was designed by a small team with a clear mission: get people speaking Chinese as quickly as possible. We designed and built our ideal learning program, combining common sense, solid linguistics and the latest technology to allow for faster learning of what's truly relevant. At the center of fluenz mandarin is a real life instructor, Sonia Gil, a Cornell graduate who went to China to learn Mandarin herself and whose more than 150 video clips in English are embedded throughout the program. \n\nFluenz has been designed around three objectives: \n\n1. Instead of learning with Chinese logic, you need to start by relating basic Chinese grammar and syntax to that of English \n2. You need to start learning those few words and structures that will allow you to communicate the most in the least amount of time and\n3. You need to learn in a way that will allow you to internalize the material to avoid quickly forgetting what you just heard.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc2dea728d516f3650293f507a9e8289c8679ee4","amp;dn":"Fluenz+Chinese+Mandarin+1+and+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc2dea728d516f3650293f507a9e8289c8679ee4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,45,234,114,141,81,111,54,80,41,63,80,122,158,130,137,200,103,158,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
