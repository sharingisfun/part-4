As opposed to the summer version, Bering Sea Gold, with boats and issues of choppy seas, this series follows dredges housed in temporary shelters set up over ice holes. Viewers of Bering Sea Gold will recognise several crew members. In the first season we follow the crews on The Lazy Gator, The Clark, and Shamrock. The second season has Shamrock, The Clark, The Anchor Management, The Wild Ranger, and Steve's World on Ice.\n\n\nFollows three gold mining teams run by driven dredge captains whose very livelihoods depend on mining this wet and frozen gold. Split second thinking, extreme focus, and team work are key to staying alive under the ice. The risks are great, and the payoff even greater. \n\nZeke Tenhoff \nEmily Riedel \nSteve Riedel \nShawn Pomrenke \nSteve Pomrenke \nCody Moen \nVernon Adkison \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2299640&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2299640&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8405c18593644284849e06dc6d9d02d338ab482","amp;dn":"Bering+Sea+Gold+Under+The+Ice+Season+1+%26amp%3B+2+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8405c18593644284849e06dc6d9d02d338ab482","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,64,92,24,89,54,68,40,72,73,224,109,198,217,208,45,51,138,180,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
