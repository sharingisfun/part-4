He heads to the village of Port Isaac in Cornwall where he had spent some time as a boy. He's a bit of an oddity in the village and some at least suspect he may be there for no good reason. He soon makes friends and finds himself working on a fishing boat and enjoying a somewhat carefree life. Someone in the village is distributing poison pen letters of a sort with messages or photos stuck inside jellies that people find on their doorstep. Soon, some of the villagers point the finger at Martin who thinks those accusing him are daft.\n\nDoc Martin tells the tale of Martin Clunes' character in the film, in the months leading up to the Saving Grace story. Martin Bamford is a heart-broken London obstetrician, in a jealous rage after he finds out that his wife has been sleeping with three of his buddies. He escapes to a small Cornish fishing village, which he grows surprisingly attached to, and is extremely reluctant to return with his cheating wife when she comes to pick him up. Although he has only been looking for a week's R &amp; R, Dr Bamford stumbles across a network of secrets in the village of Port Isaac, and finds himself embroiled in the most exciting scandal the village has seen for centuries.\n\n\nghost dog...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96e10ecbfcfcb60e325f48e872e647d2be8f4c8c","amp;dn":"Doc+Martin+%28TV+Movie+2001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96e10ecbfcfcb60e325f48e872e647d2be8f4c8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,225,14,203,252,252,182,14,50,95,72,232,114,230,71,210,190,143,76,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
