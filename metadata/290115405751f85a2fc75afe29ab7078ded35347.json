F. Schumacher. The phrase &quot;Small Is Beautiful&quot; came from a phrase by his teacher Leopold Kohr. It is often used to champion small, appropriate technologies that are believed to empower people more, in contrast with phrases such as &quot;bigger is better&quot;.\n\nFirst published in 1973, Small Is Beautiful brought Schumacher's critiques of Western economics to a wider audience during the 1973 energy crisis and emergence of globalization. The Times Literary Supplement ranked Small Is Beautiful among the 100 most influential books published since World War II.\n\n\n--------------------------\n\nThe same author's Guide for the Perplexed can be found here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8582503&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8582503&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:290115405751f85a2fc75afe29ab7078ded35347","amp;dn":"E.+F.+Schumacher+-+Small+Is+Beautiful+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"290115405751f85a2fc75afe29ab7078ded35347","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,1,21,64,87,81,248,90,47,199,90,254,41,171,112,120,222,211,83,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
