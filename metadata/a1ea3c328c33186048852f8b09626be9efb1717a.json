Fifteen years ago, Kate Summers received an offer she couldn't refuse: a newborn baby boy to adopt and call her own. Still reeling from the death of her husband and daughter, Kate accepted this little blessing and agreed to leave Boston forever and not tell a soul. Today, she has a wonderful life in Oregon, but the threat of the past catching up with her haunts her daily. Now a mysterious man is in town searching for the child, and the only person Kate can turn to has secrets of his own-secrets tying him to the boy she loves dearly. Moving at a lightning-quick pace, this taut thriller is enhanced by a pulse-pounding narration from acclaimed voice actor Jack Garrett","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1ea3c328c33186048852f8b09626be9efb1717a","amp;dn":"Lisa+Jackson-Running+Scared","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1ea3c328c33186048852f8b09626be9efb1717a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,234,60,50,140,51,24,96,72,133,47,139,9,98,107,233,239,177,113,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
