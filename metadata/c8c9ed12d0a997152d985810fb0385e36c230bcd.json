Now her all-new series cranks up the deadly danger and intense desire to the next level, as sexy serial killer hunter Charlotte Stone returns to action in her thrilling second adventure.\n\nTHE LAST KISS GOODBYE\n\nDr. Charlotte Ã¢â‚¬Å“CharlieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Stone has dedicated her career as a psychiatrist to exploring the darkest territory of all: the hearts and minds of serial killers. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a job sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s uniquely suited for, thanks to the secret talent that gives her an uncanny edgeÃ¢â‚¬â€Charlie can see dead people, whose tormented spirits cry out to her for the justice only she can provide. This blessingÃ¢â‚¬â€or curseÃ¢â‚¬â€gives Charlie the power to hunt down and catch madmen and murderers. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also turned her love life upside down by drawing her into a hopelessly passionate relationship with the lingering ghost of charismatic bad boy Michael Garland.\n\nBut thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s little time for romance with her supernatural suitor when murder comes pounding at CharlieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s door in the form of a terrified young woman fleeing a homicidal maniac. Saving her life places Charlie squarely in the cross-hairs of a sadistic predator nicknamed Ã¢â‚¬Å“the Gingerbread Man,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ notorious for manipulating his victims like pawns in a deadly chess game. And now the queen this psychopathÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bent on capturing is Charlie. Refusal to play will only put more innocent lives in danger. Matching wits with this cunningly twisted opponent will require all of CharlieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s training and expert skills. But even with her devilish Ã¢â‚¬Å“guardian angelÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€not to mention her favorite flesh-and-blood Fed, Tony BartoliÃ¢â‚¬â€watching her beautiful back, the Gingerbread ManÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s horrifying grin might be the last thing Charlie ever sees.\n\nPraise for Karen Robards\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“One of the most popular voices in womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fiction.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Newsweek\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Draw a line between two extremely popular genres, mysteries and romance novels, and in the middle you will find the bestselling Robards.
