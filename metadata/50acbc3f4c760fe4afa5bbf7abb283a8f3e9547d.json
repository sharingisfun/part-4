His best-known works are Open Veins of Latin America, 1971 and Memory of Fire Trilogy, 1976, which have both been translated into 20 languages and transcend orthodox genres: combining journalism, political analysis, and history. The author himself has proclaimed his obsession as a writer saying, &quot;I'm a writer obsessed with remembering, with remembering the past of America and above all that of Latin America, intimate land condemned to amnesia.&quot;\n\nOpen Veins of Latin America is arguably Galeano's best-known work. In this book, he analyzes the history of Latin America as a whole from the time period of European contact with the New World to contemporary Latin America arguing against the European and later U.S. economic exploitation and political dominance over the region. It was the first of his many books to be translated by Cedric Belfrage into English. It is a classic among scholars of Latin American history. The book gained popularity in the English-speaking world after the Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez gave it as a gift to U.S. President Barack Obama. Memory of Fire is a three-volume narrative of the history of America, North and South. The characters are historical figures; generals, artists, revolutionaries, workers, conquerors and the conquered, who are portrayed in brief episodes which reflect the colonial history of the continent. It starts with pre-Columbian creation myths and ends in the 1980s. It highlights not only the colonial oppression that the continent underwent but particularly the long history of resistance, from individual acts of heroism to mass revolutionary movements.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following book, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* Children of the Days: A Calendar of Human History \n\n* Mirrors: Stories of Almost Everyone\n\n* Open Veins of Latin America\n\n* Soccer in Sun and Shadow\n\n* The Memory of Fire Trilogy\n\n* Upside Down: A Primer for the Looking-Glass World\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles,and SEED the torrent,and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Galeano&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Galeano&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bombmagazine.org/article/2397/eduardo-galeano&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bombmagazine.org/article/2397/eduardo-galeano&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/24/books/eduardo-galeano-disavows-his-book-the-open-veins.html?_r=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/24/books/eduardo-galeano-disavows-his-book-the-open-veins.html?_r=0&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/23/eduardo-galeano-children-days-interview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/23/eduardo-galeano-children-days-interview&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50acbc3f4c760fe4afa5bbf7abb283a8f3e9547d","amp;dn":"Eduardo+Galeano+-++Uruguayan+Author+%286+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50acbc3f4c760fe4afa5bbf7abb283a8f3e9547d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,172,188,63,76,118,15,228,175,165,187,247,171,178,131,168,243,233,84,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
