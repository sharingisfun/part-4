Much of the band's sound is inspired by Gypsy music. The band incorporates minor-key accordion and violin (and on some albums, saxophone) mixed with punk and dub. The band has appeared in a number of independent films, most notably in 2005's Everything Is Illuminated in which the lead singer, Eugene HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼tz, co-starred with Elijah Wood in a dramady\\adventure story about the Nazi purges in Ukraine. The entire group was present for one shot in which they played a brass band. Gogol Bordello contributed two songs to the film's score, &quot;Bublitschki&quot;, and &quot;Start Wearing Purple&quot;.\n\n.: Gogol Bordello Group :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bohemianartista.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/gogol_bordello.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bohemianartista.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/gogol_bordello.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\nVoi-La Intruder ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1999\nMulti Kontra Culti vs. Irony - 2002\nEast Infection - 2004","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6f4b39927a5cac89ce9ee8b1115b8f755a745d3","amp;dn":"Gogol+Bordello+-+Discografia+1999-2004+%5BMp3+VBR%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6f4b39927a5cac89ce9ee8b1115b8f755a745d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,244,179,153,39,165,202,200,156,233,238,139,17,21,184,247,85,167,69,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
