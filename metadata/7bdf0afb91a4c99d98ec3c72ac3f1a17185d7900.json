The subject of the movie is celebrity stalking. It was released in Iceland on December 19, 1982 and subsequently, on February 18, 1983 in the United States by 20th Century Fox.\n\nAfter Raging Bull was completed, Scorsese was keen to do a pet project of his, The Last Temptation of Christ, and wanted De Niro to play Jesus Christ. De Niro was not interested and became determined that their next collaboration should be a comedy. He had purchased the rights of a script by a film critic, Paul D. Zimmermann. Scorsese pondered whether he could face shooting another film, particularly with a looming strike by the Writers Guild of America. Producer Arnon Milchan knew he could do the project away from Hollywood interference by filming entirely on location in New York and deliver it on time with the involvement of a smaller film company. In the biography overview of his work, Scorsese on Scorsese, the director had high praise for Jerry Lewis, stating that during their first conversation before shooting, Lewis was extremely professional and had assured him before shooting that there would be no ego clashes or difficulties. Scorsese said he felt Lewis' performance in the film was vastly underrated and deserved more acclaim.\n\nAccording to an interview with Lewis in the February 7, 1983 edition of People Magazine, he claimed that Scorsese and De Niro employed method acting tricks, including making a slew of anti-Semitic epithets during the filming in order to &quot;pump up Lewis' anger.&quot; Lewis described making the film as a pleasurable experience and noted that he got along well with both Scorsese and De Niro. Lewis said that before the making of the film he was invited to collaborate on certain aspects of the script dealing with celebrity life. His suggested ending of Rupert Pupkin killing Jerry, however, was turned down. As a result, Lewis felt that the film, while good, did not have a &quot;finish&quot;. Scorsese stated in an interview on the DVD release that Lewis suggested the brief scene where Jerry Langford is accosted by an old lady for autographs and she, upon Langford's polite stifle, suddenly screams out &quot;You should only get cancer!&quot; This was based on a real life incident that had happened to Lewis. Scorsese also stated that Lewis directed the actress playing the old lady in order to get the timing right.\n\nMedia Info:\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : J:\\Seeding\\The King of Comedy (1983)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢]\\The King of Comedy (1983)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢].AVI\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 1.39 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 48mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 831 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 48mn\nBit rate                         : 1 498 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 464 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.187\nStream size                      : 1.14 GiB (82%)\nWriting library                  : XviD \n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 48mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 249 MiB (17%)\nAlignment                        : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 287 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98\n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.50.1.1100\nwww.malwarebytes.org\n\nDatabase version: 5758\n2/13/2011 11:41:57 PM\nmbam-log-2011-02-13 (23-41-57).txt\n\nScan type: Quick scan\nObjects scanned: 5\nTime elapsed: 32 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nWhen using TPB please read these important notes:\n  \n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n\nRequests?
