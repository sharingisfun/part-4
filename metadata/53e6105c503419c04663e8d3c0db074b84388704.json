Jonas Brothers)\n8.The Climb\n\nThe Time of Our Lives is the second extended play (first not to be live) by American pop recording artist Miley Cyrus. It was released on August 28, 2009 under Hollywood Records as a Wal-Mart exclusive. It was specially made to reciprocally promote Cyrus's joint clothing line with Max Azria. Cyrus worked with several producers and writers on the album, mainly Dr. Luke and John Shanks, the latter who produced Cyrus's successful song &quot;The Climb.&quot; Musically, the pop album has an inclination towards rock and represented a musical transition for Cyrus. The songs are generally inspired by love and portray some of Cyrus's personal struggles and life, though she only co-wrote &quot;Before the Storm.&quot;\n\nThe extended play received critical success, with reviewers claiming it was an intelligent transition. The Time of Our Lives found commercial success by reaching the second position of the Billboard 200 for two weeks and becoming Cyrus's eighth top ten album.\n\nThe lead single from the album, &quot;Party in the U.S.A.,&quot; became Cyrus's highest charting and Hollywood Records' fastest selling single; it reached number two in the Billboard Hot 100 and the top ten in various nations. She is also to release another single in correlation to the 2010 film, The Last Song, entitled &quot;When I Look at You&quot;. The album was promoted through mainly live performances at numerous venues, notably Cyrus' first international tour, the Wonder World Tour, and a controversial performance at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53e6105c503419c04663e8d3c0db074b84388704","amp;dn":"Miley+Cyrus+-+The+Time+Of+Our+Lives+2009+CDRip+%5BCov%2BCD%5D%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53e6105c503419c04663e8d3c0db074b84388704","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,230,16,92,80,52,25,192,70,99,232,211,192,219,7,75,132,56,135,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
