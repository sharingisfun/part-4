A relic of the Cold War, the Russian FSB believes the weapon has deteriorated and is no longer effective, but they are wrong. Boco Haram has the means for mass destruction, which will be set loose upon a multitude of unsuspecting innocents on one of the world's grandest stages.\n\nTrying to solve the riddle of who might be stalking them, Pike Logan and the Taskforce have no idea whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been set in motion; but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s another secret from the Cold War buried in the Russian FSB, and exposing it will mean the difference between life and deathÃ¢â‚¬â€not only for Pike and his partner, Jennifer, but for perhaps millions more around the globe.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ff9769969b9a73db83c3a75903a472e2c9a5be3","amp;dn":"Days+of+Rage+by+Brad+Taylor+%28Retail+-+Request%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ff9769969b9a73db83c3a75903a472e2c9a5be3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,249,118,153,105,185,167,61,184,60,58,117,144,58,71,46,44,154,91,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
