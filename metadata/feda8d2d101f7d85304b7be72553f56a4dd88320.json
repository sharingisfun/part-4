Frank Baum - OZ: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION (Aladdin, 2013).  One volume edition. -- ePUB + MOBI\n\n\nL. FRANK BAUM (1856-1919) was an American author chiefly known for his Oz series of children's books, beginning with THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ (1900).  He had written The Wizard of Oz without any thought of a sequel but after reading the novel, thousands of children wrote letters to him, requesting that he craft another story about Oz.  In 1904, he wrote and published the first sequel, THE MARVELOUS LAND OF OZ, explaining that he grudgingly wrote the sequel to address the popular demand.\n\nIn all, Baum wrote 13 sequels to the original novel which were published between 1904 and 1920.\n\nEven while he was alive, Baum was styled as &quot;the Royal Historian of Oz&quot; to emphasize the concept that Oz is an actual place.  The illusion created was that characters such as Dorothy and Princess Ozma related their adventures in Oz to Baum themselves, by means of wireless telegraph.\n\nThe following novels are included in this one-volume (unillustrated) edition:\n\n  1. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900)\n  2. The Marvelous Land of Oz (1904)\n  3. Ozma of Oz (1907)\n  4. Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (1908)\n  5. The Road to Oz (1909)\n  6. The Emerald City of Oz (1910)\n  7. The Patchwork Girl of Oz (1913)\n  8. Tik-Tok of Oz (1914)\n  9. The Scarecrow of Oz (1915)\n  10. Rinkitink in Oz (1916)\n  11. The Lost Princess of Oz (1917)\n  12. The Tin Woodman of Oz (1918)\n  13. The Magic of Oz (1919)\n  14. Glinda of Oz (1920)\n  15. The Royal Book of Oz (1921) by Ruth Plumly Thompson\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n                           &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
