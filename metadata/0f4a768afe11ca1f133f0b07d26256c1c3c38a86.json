The main impetus for consumers -- who may have repurchased this title in its various formats -- is having the entire Tommy rock opera intact. While impressive, that performance merely scratches the surface of the multifaceted sonic and visual improvements that exist on the Live at Leeds (Deluxe Edition). The 1995 single-disc restoration of Live at Leeds more than doubled the original six-track album, which consists of all the non-Tommy material performed that evening. This deluxe edition features the Who's entire performance -- albeit in a somewhat truncated form. To accommodate a seamless inclusion of Tommy onto the second disc, &amp;quot;Shakin' All Over,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;My Generation,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Magic Bus&amp;quot; have been taken from their chronologically correct place at the end of the entire show and relocated to the end of the first (read: non-Tommy disc). Even though drastic improvements augmented the 1995 release, time considerations meant that some ambience and stage dialogue between the band and the audience was still missing. With the expansion to a two-CD format, much of the previously edited material has been reinstated to reflect the actual pacing of the show more accurately. This new mix -- supervised by Pete Townshend (guitar/vocal) -- is an all-encompassing stereoscape which has never felt more intimidating. Although no mention is made in the information- and memorabilia-laden 28-page liner-notes booklet, vocalist Roger Daltrey performed several vocal overdubs during Tommy which are unique to this release. Although not impossible to locate, they blend surprisingly well with a recording that is fairly old. Live at Leeds (Deluxe Edition) is a must-own release for any rock &amp;amp; roll collection.\n\nDisk 1\n\n1.\t\tHeaven And Hell (Live At Leeds)  \t\n2.\t\tI Can't Explain (Live At Leeds)  \t\n3.\t\tFortune Teller (Live At Leeds)  \t\n4.\t\tTattoo (Live At Leeds)  \t\n5.\t\tYoung Man Blues (Remixed, Live At Leeds)  \t\n6.\t\tSubstitute (Remixed, Live At Leeds)  \t\n7.\t\tHappy Jack (Live At Leeds)  \t\n8.\t\tI'm A Boy (Live At Leeds)  \t\n9.\t\tA Quick One, While He's Away (Live At Leeds)  \t\n10.\t\tSummertime Blues (Remixed, Live At Leeds)  \t\n11.\t\tShakin' All Over (Remixed, Live At Leeds)  \t\n12.\t\tMy Generation (Remixed, Live At Leeds)  \t\n13.\t\tMagic Bus (Remixed, Live At Leeds)  \t\n\n\nDisk 2\n\n1.\t\tOverture (Live At Leeds)  \t\n2.\t\tIt's A Boy (Live At Leeds)  \t\n3.\t\t1921 (Live At Leeds)  \t\n4.\t\tAmazing Journey (Live At Leeds)  \t\n5.\t\tSparks (Live At Leeds)  \t\n6.\t\tEyesight To The Blind (The Hawker) (Live At Leeds)  \t\n7.\t\tChristmas (Live At Leeds)  \t\n8.\t\tThe Acid Queen (Live At Leeds)  \t\n9.\t\tPinball Wizard (Live At Leeds)  \t\n10.\t\tDo You Think It's Alright (Live At Leeds)  \t\n11.\t\tFiddle About (Live At Leeds)  \t\n12.\t\tTommy Can You Hear Me?
