This one is based on perennial Disney favourite Goofy's adventures in domesticated bliss. Goofy is now a single dad; when son Max gets blamed for a prank gone wrong at school, Goofy blames himself and decides that, for his vacation, he's going to get away with Max alone. Of course, this is no treat for Max, who has just met the girl of his dreams and harbours no wish to spend the summer touring America with his square dad. The vacation is one disaster after another, though they aren't particularly funny disasters; the culmination involves Goofy's efforts to get Max backstage at a big rock concert\n\nFormat : MPEG-4 at 1 684 Kbps\nLength : 898 MiB for 1h 14mn 33s 109ms\n\nVideo #0 : AVC at 1 037 Kbps\nAspect : 718 x 412 (1.859) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0 : AAC at 160 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage : en\n\nAudio #1 : AAC at 160 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage : de\n\nAudio #2 : AAC at 160 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage : es\n\nAudio #3 : AAC at 160 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage : fi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dc51407abe9825b5ca04be42678b4848590a894","amp;dn":"DISNEYS-A+GOOFY+MOVIE+AAC+MP4+MULTI+AUDIO+BY+WINKER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dc51407abe9825b5ca04be42678b4848590a894","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,197,20,7,171,233,130,91,92,160,75,228,38,120,180,132,133,144,168,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
