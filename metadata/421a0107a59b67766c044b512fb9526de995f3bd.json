The third season has (at this time of writing)\nnot yet been released on DVD so it's more limited in quality due to\nthe fact that its been ripped from a recorder.\nYou also have to have in mind that this tv series was filmed between 1990-1993\nand therefore even the DVD material is not as sharp as todays HD TV series.\n\nThis show is a personal favorite of mine so I enjoy sharing it with you all :)\n\n\n\n\nStoryline\n_____________\n\nTrendy high school student Parker Lewis, for whom, as suggested by his motto,\n&quot;Not a problem&quot;, nothing is impossible.\n\nLike his best buds Mikey Randall and Jerry Steiner, and his girlfriend\nAnnie Sloane, his prime concern is achieving and maintaining coolness during\nthe turbulent years of puberty.\n\nHowever, their efforts keep being thwarted by Parker's little sister, Shelly,\nand principal Grace Musso.\n\nApart from various aspects of teenage life,\nembedded in a wealth of cartoon-like special effects and camera trickery,\nan episode regularly contains more or less subtle references to movies,\npolitics, and celebrities.\n\n\n\n\nGREETiNGS &amp; RESPECT\n_______________________\n\neztv, LOL, SKIDROW, DIMENSION, CLS, DEViANCE, Fairlight, Hoodlum, Myth,\nRazor 1911, EOD, ThC, MiRaGe, Motiv8, RTS, RiSC, rhc\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:421a0107a59b67766c044b512fb9526de995f3bd","amp;dn":"Parker+Lewis+-+Can%5C%27t+Lose+-+HeXXa+-+TV+Series+1990-1993+-+COMPL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"421a0107a59b67766c044b512fb9526de995f3bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,26,1,7,165,155,103,118,108,4,75,81,47,185,82,109,233,149,243,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
