After Green and Frangicetto discovered likeminded bandmates in second guitarist Brendan Ekstrom, bassist Nick Beard, and drummer Steve Clifford, Circa Survive recorded their debut album, Juturna (named after a Roman goddess), for Equal Vision Records in 2005. Lots of touring followed, including Warped Tour dates, and the album steadily sold close to an impressive 100,000 copies. A spot on the 2007 Coachella festival led into the late May release of Circa Survive's follow-up, On Letting Go. The band eventually left Equal Vision and signed to Atlantic, and in 2010 released its third album, Blue Sky Noise.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0e4d05066c0245f27cfd9d9e1d34f723301d6cd","amp;dn":"Circa+Survive+-+Discography+%282005-2012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0e4d05066c0245f27cfd9d9e1d34f723301d6cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,228,208,80,102,192,36,95,39,207,217,217,225,211,79,114,51,1,214,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
