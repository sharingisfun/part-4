(When asked for CD, just press ESC.)\n\nI've programmed launcher and repacked installation including registry tweaks so you\n\ndon't have to tweak registry to be able to save/load. I do not take credit for\n\nFPS-limiter. \n\nAnd yes, it works on every Windows, granted you got updated Windows Installer.\n\nEnjoy and seed!\n\n\n\nP.S.
