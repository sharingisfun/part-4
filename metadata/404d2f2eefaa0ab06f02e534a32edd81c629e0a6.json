While some have tended to view asset class mispricings as mere &quot;noise,&quot; this compelling book shows why they are important signals of opportunities and risks that will shape the market for years to come. One of today's most respected names in finance, Mohamed El-Erian puts recent events in their proper context, giving you the tools that can help you interpret the markets, benefit from global economic change, and navigate the risks.\n\nThe world economy is in the midst of a series of hand-offs. Global growth is now being heavily influenced by nations that previously had little or no systemic influence. Former debtor nations are building unforeseen wealth and, thus, enjoying unprecedented influence and facing unusual challenges. And new derivative products have changed the behavior of many market segments and players. Yet, despite all these changes, the system's infrastructure is yet to be upgraded to reflect the realities of today's and tomorrow's world. El-Erian investigates the underlying drivers of global change to shed light on how you should:\n\n* Think about the new opportunities and risks\n* Construct an appropriately diversified and internationalized portfolio\n* Protect your portfolio against new sources of systemic risk\n* Best think about the impact of central banks and financial policies around the world\n\nOffering up predictions of future developments, El-Erian directs his focus to help you capitalize on the new financial landscape, while limiting exposure to new risk configurations.\n\nWhen Markets Collide is a unique collection of books for investors and policy makers around the world. In addition to providing a thorough analysis and clear perspective of recent events, it lays down a detailed map for navigating your way through an otherwise perplexing new economic landscape.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReviews:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&quot;El-Erian is a doer and a thinker and someone who understands the risks of rare events.
