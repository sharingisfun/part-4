Some might argue that \n    ReBirth-338 V 2.0.1 is obsolete and not useful because it is free. I \n    would say that it is one of the greatest sequencer programs ever brought\n    to a stable version. Once you work at the interface and overcome its\n    complexities you will understand its value is not in versatility or\n    ability, but in the sheer quality of it as a Real-time Virtual Module. \n    Free to play and create with, you must register account with Propellerhead\n    to download mods from museum, but I have included here for your convenience.\n    \n      To Install Rebirth - Mount .iso file or burn cd and install from that. \n      I recommend mounting in a virtual drive you can leave it in all the \n      time because the program requires the cd to be inserted for use.(Prevent \n      tying up your disc drive).\n    \n    \n   ^^Or Go with Propellerhead Info&gt;\n     \t \t\n\t\t\nThe ReBirth copy protection system uses a CD key that must be mounted when you launch the application. The CD-Rom includes the application, documentation manuals, example files and ReBirth Mods. There is no technical support from Propellerhead Software, however detailed instructions are provided on this page. Check the support section for more information.\n\t\n\tWindows\n\t\n\nThere is one disc image in .iso format available for download. You can burn this image file using a CD/DVD authoring software like Nero or any other software that can burn image files to a CD. For more information, see the documentation that comes with the application or the manufacturer's website.\n\nReBirth 2.0.1 Torrent\nWindows 95/98/NT/ME/XP version. 215 mb\n\nThis is a BitTorrent download.
