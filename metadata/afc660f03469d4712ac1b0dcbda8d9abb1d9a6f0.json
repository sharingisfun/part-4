It protects virtual machines from partial or complete site failures by replicating the virtual machines from a primary site to a secondary site. vSphere Replication provides several benefits as compared to storage-based replication.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Data protection at lower cost per virtual machine.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A replication solution that allows flexibility in storage vendor selection at the primary and secondary sites.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Overall lower cost per replication.\n\nWith vSphere Replication, you can replicate virtual machines from a primary datacenter to a secondary site quickly and efficiently. After you set up the replication infrastructure, you can choose the virtual machines to be replicated at a different recovery point objective (RPO). You can configure all vSphere Replication features in the vSphere Web Client. You monitor the status of a\nreplication through the replication management and monitoring dashboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afc660f03469d4712ac1b0dcbda8d9abb1d9a6f0","amp;dn":"VMware+vSphere+Replication+6.0.0.1-%5BFirstUploads%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afc660f03469d4712ac1b0dcbda8d9abb1d9a6f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,198,96,240,52,105,212,113,42,193,176,220,189,168,217,171,177,217,166,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
