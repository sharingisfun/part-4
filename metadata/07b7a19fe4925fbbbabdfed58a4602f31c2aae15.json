He enriched many established German styles through his skill in counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organisation, and the adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France. Bach's compositions include the Brandenburg Concertos, the Mass in B minor, the The Well-Tempered Clavier, his cantatas, chorales, partitas, Passions, and organ works. His music is revered for its intellectual depth, technical command, and artistic beauty.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07b7a19fe4925fbbbabdfed58a4602f31c2aae15","amp;dn":"J.S.+Bach+Ebooks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07b7a19fe4925fbbbabdfed58a4602f31c2aae15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,183,161,159,228,146,95,187,186,189,254,213,138,70,2,243,28,42,174,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
