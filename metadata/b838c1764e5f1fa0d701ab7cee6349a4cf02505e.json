Following a couple of one-off reunions in 1985 and 1992, the original Sabbath line-up of Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward reformed, playing sporadic dates until Dio replaced Ozzy a second time, reforming the Heaven and Hell lineup to tour following the release of the compilation album The Dio Years.\n\nThis 2-CD live album was put together from the first two shows after the reunion, at the Birmingham NEC. Along with live versions of tracks such as &quot;Paranoid&quot;, &quot;N.I.B.&quot;, &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; and &quot;Iron Man&quot;, it also features two new studio tracks - &quot;Selling My Soul&quot; and &quot;Psycho Man&quot;. This was the only new material to have been officially released by Black Sabbath post-reunion until three new tracks appeared on the post-Ozzy compilation Black Sabbath: The Dio Years in 2007. The two new tracks on Reunion were also released on a single CD in the USA.\n\nBlack Sabbath received their only Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance, for the live recording of &quot;Iron Man&quot; from this album. \n\nIt was released as a digipak and in a standard 2CD jewel-case.\n\nThough the band was considered a legend by this time, this was the first &quot;official&quot; live album featuring Osbourne on vocals. 1980's Live at Last was not approved for release by the band until 2002.\n\n\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nAll songs written by Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward, except where noted.\n\nDisc 1\n\n    &quot;War Pigs&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8:28\n    &quot;Behind the Wall of Sleep&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:07\n    &quot;N.I.B.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:45\n    &quot;Fairies Wear Boots&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:19\n    &quot;Electric Funeral&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:02\n    &quot;Sweet Leaf&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:07\n    &quot;Spiral Architect&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:40\n    &quot;Into the Void&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:32\n    &quot;Snowblind&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:08\n\nDisc 2\n\n    &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:36\n    &quot;Orchid/Lord of This World&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:07\n    &quot;Dirty Women&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:29\n    &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:29\n    &quot;Iron Man&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8:21\n    &quot;Children of the Grave&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:30\n    &quot;Paranoid&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:28\n    &quot;Psycho Man&quot; (Osbourne, Iommi) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:18\n    &quot;Selling My Soul&quot; (Osbourne, Iommi) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:10\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b838c1764e5f1fa0d701ab7cee6349a4cf02505e","amp;dn":"Black+Sabbath+-+Reunion+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b838c1764e5f1fa0d701ab7cee6349a4cf02505e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,56,193,118,78,95,31,160,215,1,171,124,238,99,73,164,207,2,80,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
