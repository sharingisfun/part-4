With an Introduction by Michael Dirda.\n\nISBN: 9780811218931 | 224 pages | PDF + EPUB\n\n\nABC OF READING, published in 1934 by Ezra Pound (1885-1972), sets out the poet's approach to the appreciation and understanding of literature, focusing primarily on poetry.\n\nIt is a primer for the reader who wants to maintain an active, critical mind and become increasingly sensitive to the beauty and inspiration of the world's best literature.  With characteristic vigor and iconoclasm, Pound illustrates his precepts with exhibits meticulously chosen from the classics, and the concluding &quot;Treatise on Meter&quot; provides an illuminating essay for anyone aspiring to read and write poetry.\n\nNote: Only the EPUB edition contains the 2010 Introduction by Michael Dirda.\n\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;Incredibly alive and intelligent and Ã¯Â¬ï¿½rst-rate.&quot; -- The New York Times\n\n&quot;Full of original and suggestive ideas on the meaning and operation of the poetic art.  The comments ring with Pound's early wit and vigor.&quot; -- The New Yorker\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61244378758d4b2cb1d408505e6100870cbc3abf","amp;dn":"Ezra+Pound+-+ABC+of+Reading+%281934%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61244378758d4b2cb1d408505e6100870cbc3abf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,36,67,120,117,141,75,44,177,212,8,80,94,97,0,135,12,188,58,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
