These files may be a little large for some.  But if you aren't worried about space, and want a higher quality, then this is for you.  I've previewed the episodes and they look and sound great on a 50 inch lcd/surround sound system.\n\nStargate SG-1\nSeason 8, episodes 1-20\n\nSource: DVD Rip\nAverage File Size: 625mb\n(note: the file size is a little larger than previous seasons, by 25mb, in order to accommodate the extra audio track (French).\n\nContainer: MKV\nVideo: x264\nAudio 1: English, AC3 passthru, 5.1 channel\nAudio 2: French, AC3 passthru, Dolby Surround\nAudio 3: English-Director's Commentary, AC3 passthru, Dolby Surround\n\n(Note: Episode 18, &quot;Threads&quot;, does not contain a Director's Commentary track.  There was no Director's Commentary track on the original DVD. However, English and French tracks are included.)\n\nSubtitles: English srt (in MKV)\n\n\nPlease seed when you are done...a good rule of thumb is to upload at least as much as you've downloaded...thanks!!\n\n\np.s. I ripped many of the subtitles myself, but also used subtitles that I found online.  I did re-sync and perform spot checks and they seem fine.  However I can't guarantee the accuracy of the subs since I didn't rip them myself.  Thanks to those who did.\n\np.s.s. ATT PS3 MEDIA SERVER (which I use for these) USERS: These files may not work properly with TSMuxer...use the MEncoder engine(default) instead. Also if using MEncoder, if you have problems with audio sync, try unchecking AV/Sync Alternative Method.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b57c84afdc237c9c1b4f14df05f6d4635145396","amp;dn":"Stargate.SG-1.Season.8.x264.ac3.subs-HighQuality","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b57c84afdc237c9c1b4f14df05f6d4635145396","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,87,200,74,253,194,55,201,193,180,241,77,240,95,109,70,53,20,83,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
