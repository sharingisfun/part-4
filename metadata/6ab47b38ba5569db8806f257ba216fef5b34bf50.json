WarrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hacks are eminently practical, but theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re also intrinsically interesting, and sometimes unexpected, much like the solution to a great puzzle. They are, in a word, a delight to any programmer who is excited by the opportunity to improve.\n\nExtensive additions in this edition include\n-    A new chapter on cyclic redundancy checking (CRC), including routines for the commonly used CRC-32 code\n-    A new chapter on error correcting codes (ECC), including routines for the Hamming code\n-    More coverage of integer division by constants, including methods using only shifts and adds\n-    Computing remainders without computing a quotient\n-    More coverage of population count and counting leading zeros\n-    Array population count\n-    New algorithms for compress and expand\n-    An LRU algorithm\n-    Floating-point to/from integer conversions\n-    Approximate floating-point reciprocal square root routine\n-    A gallery of graphs of discrete functions\n-    Now with exercises and answers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ab47b38ba5569db8806f257ba216fef5b34bf50","amp;dn":"Hacker%27s+Delight+%282nd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ab47b38ba5569db8806f257ba216fef5b34bf50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,180,123,56,186,85,105,219,136,6,242,87,186,33,111,239,91,52,191,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
