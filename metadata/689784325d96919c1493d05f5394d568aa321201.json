He was the middle of three children, with an older brother Michael Earl &quot;Micah&quot; Sparks (1964ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“) and a younger sister, Danielle &quot;Dana&quot; Sparks (1966ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2000), who died at the age of 33. Sparks has said that she is the inspiration for the main character in his novel A Walk to Remember.\n \nSparks was raised Roman Catholic[1] and is of German, Czech, English and Irish ancestry.[2] He and his wife are devout Catholics, and are raising their children in the Catholic faith. &quot;I was raised Catholic, baptized, confirmed, Sunday School, went to Notre Dame, go to confession, go to church weekly,&quot; the author says. &quot;My oldest son is an altar boy. All my children go to the Catholic school. My wife Catherine was raised Catholic. We were married in the Catholic Church. God is the most important thing in our lives. I suppose that's true of everybody's lives, whether or not they want to believe it.&quot;[3]\n \nHis father was pursuing graduate studies, and the family moved a great deal, so by the time Sparks was 8, he had lived in Watertown, Minnesota, Los Angeles, and Grand Island, Nebraska. In 1974 his family settled in Fair Oaks, California, and remained there through Nicholas's high school days. He graduated in 1984 as valedictorian from Bella Vista High School, then enrolling at the University of Notre Dame, having received a full track and field scholarship. In his freshman year, his team set a record for the 4 x 800 relay.[citation needed] Sparks majored in business finance and graduated with honors in 1988. He also met his future wife that year, Cathy Cote from New Hampshire, while they were both on spring break. They married on July 22, 1989 and moved to Sacramento, California.[4]\n \n[edit]\n\n Writing career\n While still in school in 1985 , Sparks had penned his first (never published) novel, The Passing, while home for the summer between freshman and sophomore years at Notre Dame. He wrote another novel in 1989, also unpublished, The Royal Murders.\n \nAfter college, Sparks sought work with publishers or to attend law school, but was rejected in both attempts. He then spent the next three years trying other careers, including real estate appraisal, waiting tables, selling dental products by phone and starting his own manufacturing business.[5]\n \nIn 1990, Sparks co-wrote with Billy Mills Wokini: A Lakota Journey to Happiness and Self-Understanding.[6] The book was published by Feather Publishing, Random House, and Hay House. Sales for this book approximated 50,000 copies in its first year after release.[7]\n \nIn 1992, Sparks began selling pharmaceuticals and in 1993 was transferred to Greenville, SC. It was there that he wrote another novel in his spare time, The Notebook.[8] Two years later, he was discovered by literary agent Theresa Park, who picked The Notebook out of her agency's slush pile, liked it, and offered to represent him. In October 1995, Park secured a $1 million advance for The Notebook from Time Warner Book Group. The novel was published in October 1996 and made the New York Times best-seller list in its first week of release.\n \nWith the success of his first novel, he moved to New Bern, NC. After his first publishing success, he wrote several international bestsellers. Six of his novels have been made into films: Message in a Bottle (1999), A Walk to Remember (2002), The Notebook (2004), Nights in Rodanthe (2008), Dear John (2010), and The Last Song (2010).\n \nAccording to his website, he has also sold the screenplay adaptations of True Believer and At First Sight, though it is uncertain whether either film will be made.[9] His latest screenplay turned novel, The Last Song, has been turned into a film produced by Offspring Entertainment for Touchstone Pictures featuring Miley Cyrus.\n \nSparks began his 16th novel, Safe Haven, on February 17, 2010, and it was published on September 14, 2010. Film producers asked Sparks on August 4 for rights to release a movie adaptation of this new novel and the deal was closed the next day.[10]\n \nOn June 17, 2011 Nicholas Sparks stated on his official website that Warner Bros. had bought the movie rights to his new book The Best of Me, which is coming out October 11, 2011. The production date for the movie has not been verified, although Sparks believes that filming of the movie will start in 2012.[11]\n \nOn August 2, 2011, Nicholas Sparks stated via his Twitter page that Safe Haven should begin production some time in October 2011. He also confirmed that The Lucky One, starring Zac Efron, should be in theaters in either March or April 2012.[12]\n \n[edit] Personal life and philanthropy\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:689784325d96919c1493d05f5394d568aa321201","amp;dn":"Nicholas+Sparks-15+Books%2C+Mobi%2C+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"689784325d96919c1493d05f5394d568aa321201","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,151,132,50,93,150,145,156,20,147,208,95,83,148,213,104,170,50,18,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
