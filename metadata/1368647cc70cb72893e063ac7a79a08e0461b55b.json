His first career, beginning as an army intelligence officer and including a distinguished run as one of CongressÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most powerful and respected members, lasted thirty-five years and culminated in his transformational role as ClintonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s budget czar and White House chief of staff. He then Ã¢â‚¬Å“retiredÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to establish the Panetta Institute with his wife of fifty years, Sylvia; to serve on the Iraq Study Group; and to protect his beloved California coastline. But in 2009, he accepted what many said was a thankless task: returning to public office as the director of the CIA, taking it from a state of turmoil after the Bush-era torture debates and moving it back to the vital center of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s war against Al Qaeda, including the campaign that led to the killing of Osama bin Laden. And then, in the wake of bin LadenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death, Panetta became the U.S. secretary of defense, inheriting two troubled wars in a time of austerity and painful choices.\n\nLike his career, Worthy Fights is a reflection of PanettaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s values. It is imbued with the frank, grounded, and often quite funny spirit of a man who never lost touch with where he came from: his familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s walnut farm in beautiful Carmel Valley, California. It is also a testament to a lost kind of political leadership, which favors progress and duty to country over partisanship. Panetta is a Democrat who pushed for balanced budgets while also expanding care for the elderly and sick; a devout Catholic who opposes the death penalty but had to weigh every drone strike from 2009 through 2011. Throughout his career, PanettaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s polestar has been his belief that a public servantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s real choice is between leadership or crisis. Troubles always come about through no fault of oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own, but most can be prevented with courage and foresight.\n\nAs always, Panetta calls them as he sees them in Worthy Fights. Suffused with its authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decency and stubborn common sense, the book is an epic American success story, a great political memoir, and a revelatory view onto many of the great figures and events of our time.\n\nHardcover, 512 pages\nPublished October 7th 2014 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1368647cc70cb72893e063ac7a79a08e0461b55b","amp;dn":"Leon+Panetta+-+Worthy+Fights%3A+A+Memoir+of+Leadership+in+War+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1368647cc70cb72893e063ac7a79a08e0461b55b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,104,100,124,199,12,183,40,147,224,99,172,122,121,160,142,4,97,181,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
