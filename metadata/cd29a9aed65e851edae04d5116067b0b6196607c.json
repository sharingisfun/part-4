Whatever the case, 2Pac re-emerged hardened and hungry with All Eyez on Me, the first double-disc album of original material in hip-hop history. With all the controversy surrounding him, 2Pac seemingly wanted to throw down a monumental epic whose sheer scope would make it an achievement of itself. But more than that, it&amp;#039;s also an unabashed embrace of the gangsta lifestyle, backing off the sober self-recognition of Me Against the World. Sure, there are a few reflective numbers and dead-homiez tributes, but they&amp;#039;re much more romanticized this time around. All Eyez on Me is 2Pac the thug icon in all his brazen excess, throwing off all self-control and letting it all hang out -- even if some of it would have been better kept to himself. In that sense, it&amp;#039;s an accurate depiction of what made him such a volatile and compelling personality, despite some undeniable filler. On the plus side, this is easily the best production he&amp;#039;s ever had on record, handled mostly by Johnny J (notably on the smash &quot;How Do U Want It&quot;) and Dat Nigga Daz; Dr. Dre also contributes another surefire single in &quot;California Love&quot; (which, unfortunately, is present only as a remix, not the original hit version). Both hits are on the front-loaded first disc, which would be a gangsta classic in itself; other highlights include the anthemic Snoop Dogg duet &quot;2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted,&quot; &quot;All About U&quot; (with the required Nate Dogg-sung hook), and &quot;I Ain&amp;#039;t Mad at Cha,&quot; a tribute to old friends who&amp;#039;ve gotten off the streets. Despite some good moments, the second disc is slowed by filler and countless guest appearances, plus a few too many thug-lovin&amp;#039; divas crooning their loyalty. Erratic though it may be, All Eyez on Me is nonetheless carried off with the assurance of a legend in his own time, and it stands as 2Pac&amp;#039;s magnum opus.\n\n\nReleases\n\nYear \tType \tLabel \t           Catalog #:\n1996 \tCS \tDeath Row \t524204\n \n1996 \tCD \tUniversal \t5242492\n \n1996 \tCD \tDeath Row \t24204\n \n1996 \tCD \tDeath Row \t524204\n \n1996 \tLP \tDeath Row \t524204\n \n2001 \tCS \tDeath Row \t63008\n \n2001 \tCD \tKoch \t63008\n \n2001 \tCD \tKoch \t5800\n \n2001 \tCD \tDeath Row \t108\n \n2001 \tLP \tDeath Row \t63008\n \n2001 \tCD \tDeath Row \t63008\n \n2001 \tCD \tDeath Row \t63008\n \n2002 \tLP \tDeath Row \t0000004\n \n2005 \tDD \tKoch \t5866\n \n2007 \tCD \tDeath Row \t2001\n \n2008 \tCD \tHi-Note Music UK \t20\n\n\nEnjoy!!\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dpbolvw.net/click-2835923-10517765&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dpbolvw.net/click-2835923-10517765&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.vmcsatellite.com/?aid=20849&amp;subaid=15&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.vmcsatellite.com/?aid=20849&amp;subaid=15&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pwc.hostrocket.com/webhosting.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pwc.hostrocket.com/webhosting.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd29a9aed65e851edae04d5116067b0b6196607c","amp;dn":"Tupac+-+All+Eyez+On+Me+-+By+PWConnections","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd29a9aed65e851edae04d5116067b0b6196607c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,41,169,174,214,94,133,30,218,224,77,81,22,6,123,11,97,150,96,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
