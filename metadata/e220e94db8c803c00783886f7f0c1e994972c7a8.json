Now comes Bad As Me, his first studio album of all new music in seven years, which finds Tom Waits in possibly the finest voice of his career and at the height of his songwriting powers, working with a veteran team of gifted musicians and longtime co-writer/producer Kathleen Brennan. Like a good boxer, these songs are lean and mean, with strong hooks and tight running times. And there is a pervasive sense of players delighting in each otherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s musical company that brings a feeling of loose joy even to the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s saddest songs. Bad As Me is a Tom Waits album for the ages. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e220e94db8c803c00783886f7f0c1e994972c7a8","amp;dn":"Tom+Waits+-+Bad+As+Me+%5Bmp3-vbr-2011%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e220e94db8c803c00783886f7f0c1e994972c7a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,32,233,77,184,200,3,192,7,131,136,111,127,12,30,153,73,114,199,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
