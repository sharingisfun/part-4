It's home to the bat-eared fox. They feed mainly on insects. With their long, big ears, they can detect the ultrasonic waves that insects emit. Ultrasonic waves usually travel in a straight line from their source, so a fox can determine the exact location the sound is coming from and strike, even if it's underground. During the rainy season, bat-eared foxes raise their young in underground dens. The parents work as a team to confront hyenas, honey badgers and other predators that single out their pups. Relying on their giant ears and tight bonds, bat-eared fox families survive in the Serengeti through their indomitable strength and will.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9d/An-Ear-for-Danger-Bat-Eared-Fox-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2d/An-Ear-for-Danger-Bat-Eared-Fox-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3b/An-Ear-for-Danger-Bat-Eared-Fox-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2a/An-Ear-for-Danger-Bat-Eared-Fox-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/75/An-Ear-for-Danger-Bat-Eared-Fox-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/96/An-Ear-for-Danger-Bat-Eared-Fox-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c1/An-Ear-for-Danger-Bat-Eared-Fox-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/10/An-Ear-for-Danger-Bat-Eared-Fox-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b5/An-Ear-for-Danger-Bat-Eared-Fox-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 21 (~3121Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.53 VBR 48KHz (~126Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 49 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 1.11 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://pf.nhk-ep.co.jp/detail/1755","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4f3e99399a36414bb3a3862df107c2b7e7b1d50","amp;dn":"NHK+Wildlife+2012+An+Ear+for+Danger+Bat-Eared+Fox+720p+x264+AAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4f3e99399a36414bb3a3862df107c2b7e7b1d50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,243,233,147,153,163,100,20,187,58,56,98,223,16,124,43,126,123,29,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
