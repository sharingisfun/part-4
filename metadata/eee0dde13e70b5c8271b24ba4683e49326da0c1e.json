If you are like many, you may struggle with self-confidence. You may also compare your successes and failures with those of others. If everything is going well in your life, this tactic may temporarily bolster your sense of self-worth. But what happens when things arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t going so well?\n\nBased on the idea that true self-esteem is grounded in internal, rather than external factors, this book offers 50 easy-to-use mindfulness practices that will help you improve inner awareness and live a more fulfilled life without harsh self-judgment. \n\nMindfulness can help you battle feelings of low self-worth by encouraging you to pay attention to your negative thoughts as they occur, accept them, and ultimately control of how you react to them.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction , General","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eee0dde13e70b5c8271b24ba4683e49326da0c1e","amp;dn":"50+Mindful+Steps+to+Self-Esteem+by+Janetti+Marotta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eee0dde13e70b5c8271b24ba4683e49326da0c1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,224,221,225,62,112,181,200,39,27,36,186,70,131,228,147,38,218,12,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
