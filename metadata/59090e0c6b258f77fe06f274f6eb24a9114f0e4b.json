The Booster CD's have been a kind of a corner stone within the TD community building some guidelines for those newbies who needed some help where to start discovering the various landmarks of TD's work.\n Quite a reasonable number of newer compositions have also found their way into the public. But we do not want the Boosters become a racehorse within a series of titles all running against each other.\n Therefore decision has been made to stop with a last product which simultaneously has some of the best and rare TD compositions from all decades to offer - of course subjectively speaking. Relax, sit back and enjoy a little trip with the TD time machine through a well-known and sometimes strange musical territory.
