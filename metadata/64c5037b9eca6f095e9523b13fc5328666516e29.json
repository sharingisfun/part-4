I spent a very long time trying to find this. On TPB all I could get was up to 1.13b and I was getting the odd Cambria crash to desktop. This is 1.13e and I am pretty sure it is all of the DLC. Comes with a very easy to use unpacker by R.G. Shift. \n  Install is very simple just locate the folder and run the setup from there. As a warning it does want you to disable your antivirus. I scanned afterwards and everything is 100%","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64c5037b9eca6f095e9523b13fc5328666516e29","amp;dn":"Jagged+Alliance%3A+Back+in+Action+%2B+DLC+1.13e+repack+by+%5BR.G.+Shif","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64c5037b9eca6f095e9523b13fc5328666516e29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,197,3,123,158,202,111,9,94,149,35,177,63,197,50,134,102,81,110,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
