It begins as Augustus is emperor, and his scheming wife Livia will stop at nothing to make her son from a previous marriage Tiberius the next emperor. This conflict sets the stage for a long period of intrigue and double-crosses among the Roman elite, all of it witnessed by Claudius, whose limp and stammer cause everyone to think him simple-minded and thus leave him alone. But Claudius in fact posesses a very keen intellect, and is determined to see justice be done and Rome returned to a Republican form of government.\n\nComplete mini-series, compiled from SKK's excellent posts:\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3243493\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3243498\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3259951\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3243599\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3243657\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3243658\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3243705\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3243706\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3243777\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3243779\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3243801\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3252133\n\nI compiled this because, frankly, there aren't a lot of seeds left on the previous single-episodes, and it would be a shame to miss any of them.  If you've already downloaded parts of previous episodes and are waiting for a seed, many bittorrent clients allow you to selectively download single parts of the entire torrent (Azureus, BitComet, etc.)\n\nApologies for the slow-ass connection.  This will take quite some time to seed to completion, but I intend to keep seeing until a few people have it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7e71faea88a4676ac8fa9bf9fe468d9621fb797","amp;dn":"I%2C+Claudius","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7e71faea88a4676ac8fa9bf9fe468d9621fb797","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,231,31,174,168,138,70,118,172,143,169,191,159,228,104,217,98,31,183,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
