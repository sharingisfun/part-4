Thanks to original uploader.\nIncludes all 3 movies,\n\n1. Left Behind I\n2. Left Behind II - Tribulation Force &amp;\n3. Left Behind III - World at War\n   \nOriginal Uploaders Comments:\n\nLeft Behind:\n\nRayford Steele is an airline pilot whose relationship with his wife has gone sour; she responds by devoting more of her time and energy to the church, while he ponders having an affair with an attractive flight attendant, Hattie Durham. In the midst of a flight to London, a number of their passengers mysteriously disappear, and chaos takes hold as a number of vehicles on the ground and in the air are suddenly unmanned. Meanwhile, Buck Williams, a television journalist, is pondering the rash of sudden disappearances as he works on a report about Dr. Chaim Rosenzweig, an Israeli scientist who has devised a formula that would make any soil on earth easy to cultivate. However, Buck wonders if there's more to Rosenzweig than he first imagined when he discovers the doctor is in cahoots with two multi-millionaires who plan to broker the invention to promote their own agenda of international domination.\n\nTribulation Force:\n\nThose left behind face war, famine, plagues, and natural disaster so devastating that only one in four people will survive. Odds are even worse for the enemies of the Antichrist and his new world order. Rayford Steele, Buck Williams, Bruce Barnes and Chloe Steeleband together to form the Tribulation Force. Their task is clear, and their goal is nothing less than to stand and fight against the enemies of God during the seven most chaotic years the planet will ever know.\n\nLeft Behind III: World at War\n\nIt's been eighteen months since Nicolae Carpathia's rise to power, and has been captivating the whole world, including President Fitzhugh (Oscar-winner Louis Gossett, Jr.). There are some far away, who suspect he's something more, the prophesied Antichrist. After a failed attempt on the President's life, Fitzhugh must call on Buck (Kirk Cameron) and Carolyn Miller (Jessica Steen) to uncover the mystery. Meanwhile, the rest of the Trib Force group: Rayford Steele (Brad Johnson), daughter (and now Buck's wife) Chloe, Pastor Bruce Barnes (Arnold Pinnock) and the newest member Amanda White (Laura Catalano) to uncover the mystery. Soon the lives of President Fitzhugh and the Tribulationn Force will be connected in ways they couldn't have imagined.\n\nPlease seed for as long as possible. \n\nUploaded by Indian Christian.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30fb675cb8591ca610e60cc464c05cc80e5c41e4","amp;dn":"Left+Behind+Collection+%28Christian+Movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30fb675cb8591ca610e60cc464c05cc80e5c41e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,251,103,92,184,89,28,166,16,230,12,196,100,192,92,200,14,92,65,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
