But the story starts in 1989 when he received his first electric guitar as a gift: &quot;a Washburn but I don't remember the model&quot;. He started to play along with his heroes (Michael Jackson, Van Halen, Europe), while other kids his age usually preferred to play soccer. In 1992 he left the guitar to study the drums, another huge passion. &quot;Being a drummer first and a guitarist second, helped me a lot in terms of creativity and rhythmic knowledge.&quot; In 1996 he left the drums because of his growing interest in guitar, especially after an intense listening of Images and Words by Dream Theater. Today, he's a guitar player, a composer and an arranger. He worked for a lot of artists since. In 2005 he flew to Canada to record James LaBrie's third solo release titled Elements of Persuasion which has become a hit with progressive metal fans. Now member of the James LaBrie band, he put out his first solo record titled There's Hope on Feb. 15th 2008 through Lion Music. In 2010 he also worked on the James LaBrie record Static Impulse as guitar player, co-writer and engineer. He released his second solo in 2012, titled reMarcoble and edited by JTC Records. In 2013 he joined the James LaBrie's band for the third time for the registration of Impermanent Resonance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32fe2245f14171a449df962eb3a280d74c52d469","amp;dn":"Marco+Sfogli+-+reMarcoble+2012+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32fe2245f14171a449df962eb3a280d74c52d469","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,254,34,69,241,65,113,164,73,223,150,46,179,162,128,215,76,82,212,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
