They had sold their home and business in London, and said &quot;farewell to England&quot; with a cheerful party where all their friends had gathered to wish them well on their great adventure: setting off to begin life anew on a remote, bucolic farm in rural Sweden.\n\nBut with that phone call, everything changes. Your mother's not well, his father tells him. She's been imagining things--terrible, terrible things. She's had a psychotic breakdown, and has been committed to a mental hospital.\n\nDaniel prepares to rush to Sweden, on the first available flight the next day. Before he can board the plane, his father contacts him again with even more frightening news: his mother has been released from the hospital, and he doesn't know where she is.\n\nThen, he hears from his mother:\nI'm sure your father has spoken to you. Everything that man has told you is a lie. I'm not mad. I don't need a doctor. I need the police. I'm about to board a flight to London. Meet me at Heathrow.\n\nCaught between his parents, and unsure of who to believe or trust, Daniel becomes his mother's unwilling judge and jury as she tells him an urgent tale of secrets, of lies, of a horrible crime and a conspiracy that implicates his own father.\n\nGenre: Fiction/Thriller","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b991ee6fef042ea9af40d85c0511aee89bb2cb3","amp;dn":"The+Farm+by+Tom+Rob+Smith","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b991ee6fef042ea9af40d85c0511aee89bb2cb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,153,30,230,254,240,66,234,154,244,13,133,192,81,26,238,137,187,44,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
