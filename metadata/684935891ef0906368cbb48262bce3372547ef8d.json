It's not\r\nthe kind of gap you'd necessarily notice -- it's kind of like\r\nrealizing you don't have a pair of navy blue dress socks -- but it\r\nwas a gap all the same, so the group released The Beatles 1 late in\r\n2000, coinciding with the publication of their official\r\nautobiography, the puzzlingly titled Anthology. The idea behind this\r\ncompilation is to have all the number one singles the Beatles had,\r\neither in the U.K. or U.S., on one disc, and that's pretty much what\r\nthis generous 27-track collection is.\r\n\r\nRelease Date: November 14, 2000\r\n\r\nDuration: 01:18:59\r\n\r\nGenre: Pop/Rock\r\n\r\nRecording Date: September 11, 1962 - April 1, 1970","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:684935891ef0906368cbb48262bce3372547ef8d","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+1%28MP3%29%7BCTShoN%7D%5BCTRC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"684935891ef0906368cbb48262bce3372547ef8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,73,53,137,30,240,144,99,104,203,180,130,98,188,227,55,37,71,239,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
