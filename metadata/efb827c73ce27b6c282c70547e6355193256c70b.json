What followed was a mysteriously rapid rise to glory, as the team catapulted out of decades of obscurity to become one of the best in the world. Central to this success were two men named Escobar: AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s, the captain and poster child of the National Team, and Pablo, the infamous drug baron who pioneered the phenomenon known in the underworld as &quot;Narco-soccer.&quot; But just as Colombia was expected to win the 1994 World Cup and transform its international image, the shocking murder of Andres Escobar dashed the hopes of a nation.\n\nThrough the glory and the tragedy, &quot;The Two Escobars&quot; daringly investigates the secret marriage of crime and sport, and uncovers the surprising connections between the murders of Andres and Pablo.[/quote]\n\nVIDEO: MPEG4 (AVC)\n832x468 - (16/9)\n1268 Kbps\n30 fps\n\nAUDIO: AAC\n5.1 channels\n128 Kbps\n\n\nBROADCAST: ESPN-HD\nFULL BROADCAST\nCommercials cut","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efb827c73ce27b6c282c70547e6355193256c70b","amp;dn":"30+for+30+-+The+Two+Escobars","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efb827c73ce27b6c282c70547e6355193256c70b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,184,39,199,60,226,123,108,40,44,112,84,126,99,85,25,50,86,199,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
