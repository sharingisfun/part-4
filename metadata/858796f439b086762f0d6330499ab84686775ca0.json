Running a mere 65 minutes, the film divides its time equally between a platoon of soldiers operating on the Israeli-Lebanese border, and the two men at the center of a clandestine relationship.\n\nYossi (Ohad Knoller) is a brooding commander who feels constrained by his role as a macho authority figure to conceal his sexuality from the conscripts under his command, while Jagger (Yehuda Levi) is one of his subordinates, a carefree guy who wants them to declare their love publicly by retiring from the Army and setting up house together. There\\&amp;#039;s a now-famous scene, early in the movie, when Yossi and Jagger make love in the snow (don\\&amp;#039;t get excited - all you see are some lingering kisses and the aftermath, in which the two characters are entirely at ease with one another, free from the restraints imposed by Army discipline), but their romance takes up a surprisingly small amount of the movie\\&amp;#039;s running time, which appears to have been curtailed for reasons of length (there\\&amp;#039;s a number of images doing the rounds from scenes which were apparently shot but didn\\&amp;#039;t make it to the final print). Based on a true story, the film is warm-hearted...\n\nHardcoded English subtitles.\n\nImage quality is good but not great.  This is the clearest copy I have found. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:858796f439b086762f0d6330499ab84686775ca0","amp;dn":"Yossi+%26+Jagger%5BEng+Subs%5D+%282002%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"858796f439b086762f0d6330499ab84686775ca0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,135,150,244,57,176,134,118,47,13,99,48,73,154,184,70,134,119,92,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
