Stewart Lee is 42 and \nFrankie's heartless Scottish words have made him \nwonder if it's worth carrying on.\n\nUndaunted, the furiously baffled comedian tries to \nwin round the legendarily harsh Glasgow audience \nwith a crowd-pleasing Mcintyre-style routine about \ncoffee shops, but is distracted by scores of imaginary \npirates; he tries to talk about every day middle aged \nmen's concerns, but is drawn into a forty minute rant \nagainst Top Gear and all it stands for; he attempts to \nfind some common ground with happy childhood memories \nthat he and the audience can share, but is instead \nconsumed with loathing and despair as a result of a \nMagners' Cider advertising campaign.\n\nHe screams from the balconies, stumbles in the aisles, \nand ends with a country and western song. If You Prefer \nA Milder Comedian Please Ask For One is a vast and \nall-consuming epic of stand-up comedy, exploring the \nabsolute formal limits of the art form. \n\nThere are also some jokes. \n\n[Clan]\n\nLookin fae: 100mbit+ eu affils, uk [ph]dtv cappers, retai","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33d5cefa27a7826fefb43df25589a14bcb43733c","amp;dn":"Stewart.Lee.If.You.Prefer.A.Milder.Comedian.Please.Ask.For.One.D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33d5cefa27a7826fefb43df25589a14bcb43733c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,213,206,250,39,167,130,111,239,180,61,242,85,137,161,75,203,67,115,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
