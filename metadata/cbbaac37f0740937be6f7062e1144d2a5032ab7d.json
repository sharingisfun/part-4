You CANNOT Upgrade from previous versions of Windows.\nThere is no validation required. This PASSES WGA. This works 100% with Windows Update.\nI have included the CD-Key already in the install process. This means at no point will you have to enter it.\nSome people using Macs or Virtual Machines might need the serial. See Serial.txt if you do need it.\nSerial.txt is located in the download folder and in a folder on the disc/iso.\nThis has all windows updates through November 2010. This is has been tested numerous times with no errors.\nThis has minimalist Internet Explorer 6. (Use It To Download Firefox, Opera, Safari, Chrome, Etc)\nThis is the x86 version (32Bit).\n\nAlmost all drivers have been stripped from this release. You must install all necessary drivers on your own.\n\nUpdates currently work fine and this also currently passes WGA.\n\nThis is set to automatically log you in each time you start up. If you want to be prompted for a username and password\nplease see the &quot;TJ&quot; folder on the disc. It contains a registry patch that you can run to have it prompt for username and password again.\nThis folder on the disc also contains numerous other little tweak applications, registry patches &amp; More.\n\nI have integrated the latest DirectX &amp; System runtimes. I have removed the original Net Framework that ships with XP. It's super old and outdated.\nYou can still download and use a newer version however. Just download the latest version from Microsoft.com or Windows Update.\n\nThis CANNOT be installed via a USB Drive. Sorry, Critical files needed for a USB install have been removed to keep size very small.\n\nThe Following has been Removed From This OS...\n\nApplications:\nBriefcase\nGames\nInternet Games\nPinball\nScreensavers\n\nDrivers:\nAsynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)\nDisplay Adapters\nIBM PS/2 TrackPoint\nIBM ThinkPad\nISDN\nLogitech WingMan\nMicrosoft SideWinder\nModems\nMultifunctional\nPrinters\nScanners\nSerial Pen Tablet\nSony Jog Dial\nTape drives\nToshiba DVD decoder card\n\nHardware Support:\nATM Support\nBrother Devices\nGravis Digital GamePort\nIomega Zip drive\nMulti-port serial adapters\nRamdisk\nWindows CE USB Host\n\nMultimedia:\nAOL ART Image Format Support\nImages and Backgrounds\nIntel Indeo codecs\nMedia Center\nMouse Cursors\nMovie Maker\nMusic Samples\nOld CDPlayer and Sound Recorder\nTablet PC\nWindows Media Player\nWindows Sounds\n\nNetwork:\nClient for Netware Networks\nCommunication tools\nComtrol Test Terminal Program\nConnection Manager\nFrontPage Extensions\nH323 MSP\nInternet Connection Wizard\nInternet Information Services\nIP Conferencing\nMSN Explorer\nNetmeeting\nNetShell Cmd-Tool\nNetwork Diagnostic\nPeer-to-Peer (Has Nothing To Do With Torrents, XDCC, UseNet, Gnutella, LimeWire, Etc)\nShare Creation Wizard\nSynchronization Manager\nTAPI Application Support\nVector Graphics Rendering\nWeb Folders\nWindows Messenger\n\nOperating System Options:\nNET Framework\nBlaster/Nachi removal tool\nColor Schemes\nDesktop Cleanup Wizard\nDocument Templates\nDR Watson\nFAT to NTFS converter\nFile and Settings Wizard\nFile System Encryption\nHelp and Support\nIExpress Wizard\nManual Install and Upgrade\nMS Agent\nMS XML 2.0\nOut of Box Experience\nPrivate Character Editor\nRemote Installation Services\nSearch Assistant\nSecurity Center\nService Pack Messages\nSymbolic Debugger\nTour\nWeb View\n\nServices:\nApplication Layer Gateway\nError Reporting\nIndexing Service\nMessenger\nNetwork DDE\nRemote Registry\nRemovable Storage\nRoute Listening Service\nRPC Locator\nService Advertising Protocol\nSimple TCP/IP Services\nTelnet\n\nDirectories:\nDOCS\nSUPPORT\nVALUEADD\n\nI have disabled and deleted the Classic Windows XP Install Screens with the info about XP and the blue Background.\nYou will just see a black background now and the install will look similar to 2000. This saves Space and gives more\ninfo while installing.\n\nThe Minimum HD and RAM Requirements have been lifted. You can try and install this on whatever machine you like now.\nHigh ISO Compression has been enabled to save space.\n\nPatches:\nTCP/IP Half-Open Connections = 1000 (Default 10)\nUXTheme Patch

Number\nFirewall Disabled (Can be re-enabled)\nSystem Restore Service Disabled (Can be re-enabled)\nAutomatic Updates Disabled (Can be re-enabled)\nDefault Theme Set on Classic (Can Change to Luna Which is Still Included)\n\nInstall Notes:\n1. Unrar the Archive(s) using WinRAR or 7Zip. This will produce an ISO file.\n2. Burn the ISO using a program such as IMGBurn, Nero, Alcohol 120, Blindwrite, ect... (Burn at a slow Speed to ensure no errors, 1x-4x)\n3. Change Bios Priority settings so it boots from the CD-ROM Drive First. (You may be able to skip this step)\n4. Insert Disc and Reboot PC, Follow the on screen prompts and enjoy.\n\nNotes:\nIf you are getting errors while copying files. It's your CD, not the release. Try burning it to different brand of cd/media and try burning at the slowest speed possible.\nI just tested this in VMWare and it works flawless. You should get between 16-19 Processes and under 100mb of ram usage when using the computer initially.\nEverything you install/use will obviously increase this, however its the leanest XP Copy around.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbbaac37f0740937be6f7062e1144d2a5032ab7d","amp;dn":"Windows+XP+Pro+Performance+Edition+SP3+November+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbbaac37f0740937be6f7062e1144d2a5032ab7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,186,172,55,240,116,9,55,190,111,112,98,225,20,77,42,80,50,171,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
