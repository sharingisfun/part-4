Gabriel Cash is a Los Angeles narcotics cop who has long, disheveled hair, and dresses in worn-out sweatshirts. Even though they are rivals, Tango and Cash are the two best narcs in LA, which infuriates drug kingpin Yves Perret. Perret wants Tango and Cash out of the way, so Perret frames them for the murder of an undercover FBI agent. Perret's plan is to have Tango and Cash killed in prison in order to avoid risking all-out war with the LAPD. But Tango and Cash accept a plea bargain that will give them 18 months in a minimum-security prison, then Perret arranges for their destination to be diverted to a maximum-security prison where Perret's minions proceed to torture Tango and Cash. Tango and Cash are forced to work together in a spectacular escape from the prison. After the escape, Tango and Cash set out to prove their innocence, and Cash has a romance with Tango's sister Catherine &quot;kiki&quot; Tango.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0098439/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0098439/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63ca18a617c67c51e87ca39a13e4a90cda2131cc","amp;dn":"Tango.and.Cash.DVDRip.DivX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63ca18a617c67c51e87ca39a13e4a90cda2131cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,202,24,166,23,198,124,81,232,124,163,154,19,228,169,12,218,33,49,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
