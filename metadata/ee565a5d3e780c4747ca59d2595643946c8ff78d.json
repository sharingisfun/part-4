But in the midst of an economic crisis, it's just as important to save money as it is to go green. \n\nAs Gehring shows in this thorough but concise guide, being kind to Mother Earth can also mean being kind to your bank account! It doesn't matter where your homestead is located-farm, suburb, or even city. Wherever you live, The Homesteading Handbook can help you.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction / Cooking","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee565a5d3e780c4747ca59d2595643946c8ff78d","amp;dn":"The+Homesteading+Handbook+by+Abigail+R.+Gehring","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee565a5d3e780c4747ca59d2595643946c8ff78d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,86,90,93,62,120,12,71,71,202,89,210,89,86,67,148,108,143,247,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
