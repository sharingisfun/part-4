Plus, author Todd Perkins shows how to monetize your game further with income from Google Mobile ads. The course demonstrates how to install and set up your coding environment; build the game's core scenes, layers, and sprites; handle touch and accelerometer data; create classes based on a detailed game flow chart; and manage misses, wins, and scores. Last, you'll prepare your game to support Google ads and in-app purchases.\n\nTopics Include:\n---------------\n* Installing and downloading Cocos2d-x\n* Positioning sprites and adjusting their properties\n* Creating simple frame animations\n* Designing for multiple screen sizes\n* Adding buttons\n* Incorporating audio\n* Creating the core classes and constants\n* Adding the game layers and background\n* Displaying challenges at timed intervals\n* Displaying the player's score\n* Enabling a pause feature\n* Enabling ads and in-game purchases for Google Play and the Amazon Appstore for Android\n\nIntroduction 5m 1s\n------------------\nWelcome 59s\nUsing the exercise files 2m 36s\nWhat you should know before starting this course 25s\nViewing the finished game 1m 1s\n\n1.
