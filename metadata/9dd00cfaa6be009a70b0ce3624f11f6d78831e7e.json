The audience therefore includes clinicians who want to serve their patients better and patients who are eager to supplement their own conventional treatment.\nThe authors of the book belong to three different fields, viz. clinical and basic sciences, Chinese medicine and pharmacology. They provide information from their areas of expertise and concern, attempting to make it comprehensive for users. The approach is macroscopic and philosophical; readers convinced of the philosophy are to seek specific assistance.\n\nAuthor(s): Ping-Chung Leung, Charlie Changli Xue, Yung-Chi Cheng.\nTitle: A Comprehensive Guide to Chinese Medicine\nPublisher: World Scientific Publishing Company\nYear: 2003\nFormat: PDF\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
