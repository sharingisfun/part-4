Maddie and Chloe compete head-to-head and continuing with the political theme Abby has the Abby Lee Dance Company vote on who gave the best performance. Forced to sit on the sidelines, injured Mackenzie must watch her coveted spot on the team be taken over by ALDC's newest little powerhouse, Asia.\n\n\nThanks to RKSTR for capping and sharing.\n\nEnjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32121331a4ba19f1c93aa0d4d8108ac5db6c8e04","amp;dn":"Dance.Moms.S03E15.The.Politics.Of.Dancing.HDTV.x264-RKSTR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32121331a4ba19f1c93aa0d4d8108ac5db6c8e04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,18,19,49,164,186,25,241,201,58,160,212,216,16,138,197,219,108,142,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
