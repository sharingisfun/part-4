Unable to prevent herself from being drawn into the very club she despises, Winter is about to lose everything important to her, unless Viper can prove sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more than a moonlight run.\n\nKnox's Stand\nKnox, a former Navy Seal, has been in several dangerous situations, but nothing compares to dealing with Diamond Richards. Framed for murder, he needs the passionless lawyer to prove his innocence. But when he no longer needs her help, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to show her the passion sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s capable of and walk away a free man.\nDiamond plans on earning her huge fee to prove Knox is innocent, but she had no idea the muscled biker could bring out the passion she kept hidden behind her designer clothes.
