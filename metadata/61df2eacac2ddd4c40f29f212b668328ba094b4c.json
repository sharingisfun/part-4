Although the Grateful Dead ultimately proved more long-lived and popular, Jefferson Airplane defined the San Francisco sound in the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢60s, with the acid rock guitar playing of Jorma Kaukonen and the soaring twin vocals of Grace Slick and Marty Balin, scoring hit singles and looking out from the covers of national magazines.\nThey epitomized the drug-taking hippie ethos as well as the left-wing, antiwar political movement of their time, and their history was one of controversy along with hit records. Their personal interactions mirrored those times; the group was a collective with shifting alliances, in which leaders emerged and retreated. But for all the turmoil, Jefferson Airplane was remarkably productive between 1965 and 1972.\n\nDeluxe Vinyl Replicas by Culture Factory constitute high quality reissued compact-discs which reproduce all the components of the original LPs and are their exact replicas in compact-disc size, with authentic single or gatefold cardboard jackets and paper sleeves. Culture Factory strives to achieve an authentic sound with the highest possible fidelity to the original studio masters.\nIn the remastering studio the audio tracks are handled in the form of high-definition, 96Kz / 24-bit digital files for greatest preservation of fidelity. Signal compression is sometimes used to bring out frequencies that were absent or barely heard in the original recordings, and we use the least amount of compression possible. While sound perception varies greatly among individuals our vinyl replica CDs are designed to provide the optimal listening experience when using flat EQ settings.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61df2eacac2ddd4c40f29f212b668328ba094b4c","amp;dn":"Jefferson+Airplane+-+Surrealistic+Pillow+%282013%29+%5BCulture+Factory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61df2eacac2ddd4c40f29f212b668328ba094b4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,223,46,172,172,45,221,76,64,242,159,33,43,102,131,40,186,9,75,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
