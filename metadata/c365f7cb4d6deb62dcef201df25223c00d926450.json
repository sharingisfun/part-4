IRL yelling and excitement \nmay occur, in this ultimate two-player showdown of fast-paced \nfencing and melee attacks. \n\nBeware, advantages in Nidhogg are often fleeting, as new opponents \ncontinually spawn in your way. Use a variety of fencing maneuvers \nwhile armed -- lunges, parries, and even dirty tricks like throwing \nyour sword. If swordless, press forward with punches, sweep kicks, \ndive kicks, rolls, and wall jumps. \n\nThe combat arena stretches in both directions, although besting an \nopponent only gains you ground. Matches arenÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“t won or lost with a \nsingle kill, but with a series of kills granting you right-of-way \nto run/fight/flee to your own goal-zone. \n\nEach arena holds different strategic formations and chokepoints to \nuse to your advantage. Until you reach your goal-zone, anything is \npossible. Only one thing is certain in NidhoggÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Âª the only way to win \nis to outwit your opponent. En Garde! \n\nInstallation instructions:\n1. Execute the Nidhogg v1.0 (2-click run).exe file.\n2. Follow the instructions.\n3. Enjoy the program.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c365f7cb4d6deb62dcef201df25223c00d926450","amp;dn":"Nidhogg+v1.0+%282-click+run%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c365f7cb4d6deb62dcef201df25223c00d926450","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,101,247,203,77,109,235,98,220,239,32,29,242,82,35,192,13,146,100,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
