Even the imperial legions, long inured to the bloodshed, yearn for some respite. Yet Empress Laseen's rule remains absolute, enforced by her dread Claw assassins.\n&quot;For Sergeant Whiskeyjack and his squad of Bridgeburners, and for Tattersail, surviving sorceress of the Second Legion, the aftermath of the Siege of Pale should have been a time to mourn the many dead. But Darujhistan, last of the Free Cities of Genabackis, yet holds out and it is to this ancient citadel that Laseen turns her predatory gaze.\n\n&quot;However, it would appear that the Empire is not alone in this great game. Sinister, shadowbound forces are gathering as the gods themselves prepare to play their hand...&quot;\n\n\n\nGardens of the Moon is the first novel in the Malazan Book of the Fallen epic fantasy series.\n\nRead for you by Ralph Lister.\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n-Ventricle","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54a0b054535ad805d0cf2c77a7737cffa753269b","amp;dn":"Gardens+of+the+Moon+-+Steven+Erikson+-+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54a0b054535ad805d0cf2c77a7737cffa753269b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,160,176,84,83,90,216,5,208,207,44,119,167,115,124,255,167,83,38,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
