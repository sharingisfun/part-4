Ben Webster\n\nRoots\n\n1962\n\n\n\n\nCD / 2006 / 320Kbps\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. I'd Rather Drink Muddy Water \n\n2. I'm Gonna Move to the Outskirts of Town\n \n3. Key to the Highway\n \n4. Did You Ever\n \n5. Confessin' the Blues\n \n6. Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out\n \n7. Your Red Wagon\n \n8. Rain Is Such a Lonesome Sound\n \n9. Cherry Red\n \n10. It's a Low Down Dirty Shame\n \n11. Just a Dream\n \n12. Please, Mr. Webster \n\n\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\n\nJimmy Witherspoon: vocals\n\nBen Webster: tenor-sax\n\nGerald Wilson: trumpet\n\nErnie Freeman: piano\n\nHerman Mitchell: guitar\n\nRalph Hamilton: bass\n\nJim Miller: drums\n\n\n\n\nJimmy Witherspoon laid out two great records in 1962 on Reprise, Spoon and this one. \nRoots places the great blues singer and guitarist in the company of saxophonist Ben Webster, trumpeter Gerald Wilson, and a rhythm section consisting of pianist Ernie Freeman and drummer Jim Miller. The mood is laid-back, down-home, and full of emotion and sentiment. \nThe warmth of Witherspoon's voice on material like &quot;Your Red Wagon,&quot; &quot;I'd Rather Drink Muddy Water,&quot; &quot;Key to the Highway&quot; (in one of the more unique versions ever recorded), and Jimmy Rushing's &quot;Did You Ever&quot; is on the other side of lonesome. Webster and Wilson underscore the sung lines with fills that accent the deep blue in Witherspoon's vocal.\nIt's just chilling. This is one of those recordings that is a true hidden classic. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:528f782ef0937a12a3776659688deb0dc7a219b0","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Witherspoon+feat.+Ben+Webster+-+Roots+1962+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"528f782ef0937a12a3776659688deb0dc7a219b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,143,120,46,240,147,122,18,163,119,102,89,104,141,235,13,199,162,25,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
