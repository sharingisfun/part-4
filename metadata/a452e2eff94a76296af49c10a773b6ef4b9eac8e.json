It was released on \nJune 3, 2014 through Demigodz Records and Dirty Version. The album is mostly produced by Apathy, along with other \nproducers, such as Da Beatminerz on the first track of the same name as the album, Teddy Roxpin, Smoke the World on \n&quot;The Grand Leveler&quot;, and The Doppelgangaz on &quot;Beefin' Over Bitches&quot; (which features Kappa Gamma on the track).\n\n\n\nConnecticut Casual has been described as an album that uncovers the darker sides of Connecticut and New England that \nmost people are unfamiliar with. &quot;From the opulent lifestyle of the Kennedy family, to the economically destitute \nneighborhoods of Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Mansions and projects. Tennis courts and bodegas. \nSummers spent on the shores of the Atlantic. Mysterious meetings in Masonic lodges. Homicides that go unsolved due to \ninadequate law enforcement budgets in poor areas, to literally getting away with murder by being well connected to \nEast Coast royalty.&quot; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n           We pillage, we plunder we rifle and loot\n                It's a pirate's life for me\n                   Drink up, me hearties\n\t\t\t\n                       _____|____\n                      | Ph1l0s0phy|\n\t\t      |     1s    |\n\t\t      |\t   D34d   |\n                      |.----||----.\n                        .---''---,\n                         ;..__..'    _...\n                       ,'/  ;|/..--''    \n                     ,'_/.-/':            :\n                _..-'''/  /  |         _|/|\n                     /-./_ ;       ,;'   \n               ,    / :  `:       //    `:`.\n             ,'    /-._;   | :    : ::    ,.   .\n           ,'     ::   /`-._| |    | || ' :  `.`.)\n        _,'       |;._:: |  | |    | `|   :    `'\n      ,'   `.     /   |`-:_ ; |    |  |  : \n      `--.   )   /|-._:    :          |    \n         /  /   :_|   ;`-._;   __..--';    : :\n        /  (    ;|;-./_  _/.-:'o |   /     ' |\n       /  , ._/_/_./--''/_|:|___|_,'        |\n      :  /   `'-'--'----'---------'          |\n      | :     O ._O   O_.
