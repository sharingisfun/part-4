Hosted by Pete Evans and Manu Feildel.\n\nEmma and Jane Victoria\nWe're both successful in our careers but we're here because our real passion is food. \nHigh school friends and flatmates Jane and Emma are an almost unlikely match.\nStraight-laced corporate lawyer Jane is highly organised, highly strung and very particular with crossing all the T's and dotting all the I's in everything she does.\n&quot;I am a perfectionist and it pretty much impacts every aspect of my life,&quot; confesses Jane.\nBy contrast, her flatmate of 18 months Emma is a laidback, messy-at-times free flowing advertising accounts executive.\n&quot;I don't clean dishes,&quot; admits advertising account manager Emma, 27. &quot;Jane is very clean; I'm a bit more relaxed. Jane is so prim and proper Ã¢â‚¬â€œ she is just like Mary Poppins.&quot;\nTo which Jane quickly adds: &quot;Practically perfect in every way.&quot;\nAfter moving in together, the girls implemented 'Gourmet Sundays'. &quot;During the week it's so busy and you don't have time to cook so we try to do something nice on Sunday afternoons,&quot; says Jane, 27.\n&quot;We're both successful in our careers but we're here because our real passion is food,&quot; says Emma. &quot;We eat out two to three times a week, we spend pretty much all of our money on food. We're obsessed.&quot;\nThey love to throw themed dinner parties for their friends so they can get more time experimenting in the kitchen. &quot;We all have to make one dish in the theme,&quot; explains Emma of their previous Jamaican and Mexican themed nights.\nBut their approach in the kitchen mirrors their very different personalities as well.\n&quot;We're completely opposite,&quot; says Emma. &quot;I'm more loose, like I won't usually measure stuff and I'll get it close enough and I'll taste it.&quot;\n&quot;And because I love desserts, I'm very precise. With baking you kind of have to be. Measure everything out and follow the recipe down to a T,&quot; admits Jane.\nAs such Emma focuses on the first two savoury courses, while Jane is head chef in the sweets department.\n&quot;My favourite course to order in a restaurant is entrÃƒÂ©e because you can try more,&quot; says Emma.\nBoth the eldest of four siblings, they grew up in large households. Emma's mum started a family rule when she was 13 that everyone had to cook one meal a week. She kicked it off with a beef casserole from a children's cookbook and so began her love affair with slow cooking.\n&quot;My signature dish is probably my lamb shanks,&quot; she enthuses.\nJane will round off the meal with her delicious red velvet cake. &quot;I used to do a lot of baking when I was younger. My grandma was a good cook. And I've still stuck with the desserts now. I like to make cakes, like red velvet cakes and things like that. Pretty desserts. I'm very girly,&quot; says Jane.\nBut the one thing Jane is hoping isn't in abundance in the competition is chilli. &quot;I hate spicy food. I wish I liked it because I feel like I'm missing out because everyone else raves about it. But I just think it spoils it and I can't taste anything else. I'm working on it; I'm trying to build my tolerance.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:425d11bce13f7fa3873bb9c60cb0172fce30b2f8","amp;dn":"My.Kitchen.Rules.s06e16.WS.PDTV.x264.BF1.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"425d11bce13f7fa3873bb9c60cb0172fce30b2f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,93,17,188,225,63,127,163,135,59,185,198,12,176,23,47,206,48,178,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
