Now, for the first time, del Toro reveals the inspirations behind his signature artistic motifs, sharing the contents of his personal notebooks, collections, and other obsessions. The result is a startling, intimate glimpse into the life and mind of one of the world's most creative visionaries. Complete with running commentary, interview text, and annotations that contextualize the ample visual material, this deluxe compendium is every bit as inspired as del Toro is himself.\nContains a foreword by James Cameron, an afterword by Tom Cruise, and contributions from other luminaries, including Neil Gaiman and John Landis, among others.\n\nAbout the Author\nBorn and raised in Guadalajara, Mexico in 1964, Guillermo Del Toro displayed rare filmmaking talent from an earlier age. A film prodigy dedicated to Latin American cinema, he soon earned a place on Time magazine's list of &quot;50 Young Leaders for the New Millenium.&quot; After executive producing his first feature at age 22, he worked as a special effects make-up designer for several years before forming his own company, Necropia. In 1993, Del Toro made his feature directorial debut with the film Cronos, which went on to win multiple awards, including the Critics Prize at the Cannes Film Festival and eight of his country's academy awards. In the wake of that success he made his first foray into Hollywood filmmaking with Mimic (1997) starring Mira Sorvino. He returned to his native Mexico in 2001 to make The Devil's Backbone, a chilling ghost story set during the Spanish Civil War, a time period he revisited in 2006 in his masterpiece, Pan's Labyrinth, which garnered enormous critical praise worldwide and won three Academy Awards. He has also directed several successful comic-book inspired films such as Blade II, Hellboy I, and Hellboy II. He will direct two films based on THE HOBBIT, to be produced by Peter Jackson.\n\nMarc Scott Zicree has created classic episodes of &quot;Star Trek-The Next Generation,&quot; &quot;Deep Space Nine,&quot; &quot;Babylon Five,&quot; &quot;Sliders&quot; and many more. He has appeared as a media expert on hundreds of radio and TV shows and is the author of the bestselling Twilight Zone Companion. He lives in West Hollywood with his wonderful wife, vile little dog, and affable big dog.\n\nCONTENTS\nDEDICATION\nFOREWORD BY JAMES CAMERON\nINTRODUCTION\nCOLLECTIONS\nBLEAK HOUSE\nGRAPHIC INSPIRATIONS\nANALYZING FILM\nSTORYTELLING\nIDEA INCUBATORS\nNOTEBOOKS\nCRONOS\nMIMIC\nTHE DEVILÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S BACKBONE\nBLADE II\nHELLBOY\nPANÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S LABYRINTH\nHELLBOY II: THE GOLDEN ARMY\nPACIFIC RIM\nUNFINISHED PROJECTS\nMEAT MARKET\nMEPHISTOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S BRIDGE\nTHE LIST OF SEVEN\nTHE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS\nAT THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS\nAFTERWORD BY TOM CRUISE\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nCREDITS\nCOPYRIGHT\nABOUT THE PUBLISHER","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaf13fcff41d7baaa5d521a67ffa797e8777b190","amp;dn":"Guillermo+del+Toro+Cabinet+of+Curiosities+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaf13fcff41d7baaa5d521a67ffa797e8777b190","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,241,63,207,244,29,123,170,165,213,33,166,127,250,121,126,135,119,177,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
