While no one doubts her magic ability, it is just that all of the\nspells that she casts go wrong, usually with disastrous and explosive results. Rumour has it that none\nof the spells that she tried to cast have ever gone as expected, which is how she picked up her nickname Ã¢â‚¬â€ Zero.\n\nOne of the most import second-year student rituals is the summoning of a familiar. A familiar once summoned\nwill stay with the magician for rest of their life. A mage's magical familiar can appear in the form of any\ncreature Ã¢â‚¬â€ as small as a mouse, as a fearsome fire salamander, and perhaps even as a dragon for an\nexceptional mage. True to form, Louise's familiar summoning spell goes very wrong and pulls Hiraga Saito\nfrom his life as a high school student in Japan into the magic world. The ritual is sacred and once started,\ncannot be changed, so Louise accepts her fate and gives Saito a kiss (on the lips) to seal their bond. The\nother students take delight in teasing Zero Louise at having summoned an ordinary commoner as a familiar,\nbut they have forgotten that familiars are magical creatures and by their nature Ã¢â‚¬â€ are never ordinary or common. \n\n\nVIDEO\nVideo Source: BD-J\nVideo Codec: H.264/AVC\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720p HD (16:9)\nVideo FPS: 23.976\n\nAUDIO\nCodec: FLAC 16bit\nTrack 1: English: Stereo\nTrack 2: Japanese: Stereo\n\nSUBTITLES\nTrack 1: English Signs/Songs\nTrack 2: English Subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6de54a7e43a63c686f9536a1214019f91783e840","amp;dn":"%5BCBM%5D+The+Familiar+of+Zero+1-13+Complete+%28Dual+Audio%29+%5BBDRip-720","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6de54a7e43a63c686f9536a1214019f91783e840","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,229,74,126,67,166,60,104,111,149,54,161,33,64,25,249,23,131,232,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
