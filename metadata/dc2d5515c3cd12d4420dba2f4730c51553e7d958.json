It is a spin-off from the popular X-Men franchise. The series has been relaunched several times with different team rosters, most recently in X-Factor volume 3 as X-Factor Investigations.\n\nX-Factor launched in 1986, featuring a team composed of the five original X-Men. In 1991, the founding members were incorporated back into the regular X-Men series, and X-Factor relaunched as a U.S. government-sponsored team incorporating many secondary characters from the X-Men mythos. The series was canceled in 1998.\n\nIn 2002, a four-part X-Factor mini-series detailed an investigation by the Mutant Civil Rights Task Force into an alleged conspiracy by hate-groups to commit murder against mutants.\n\nIn 2005, a new X-Factor series was launched, following the mutant detective agency X-Factor Investigations. Written by Peter David, the series drew acclaim from Ain't It Cool News, as well as controversy for establishing a romantic relationship between Rictor and Shatterstar, a move criticized by Shatterstar's co-creator, Rob Liefeld. The series also won a 2011 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comic Book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc2d5515c3cd12d4420dba2f4730c51553e7d958","amp;dn":"X-FACTOR+001-253+%281986-2013%29+Complete+%28Marvel%29+%2B+Annuals+%2B+More","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc2d5515c3cd12d4420dba2f4730c51553e7d958","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,45,85,21,195,205,18,212,66,13,186,47,71,48,197,21,83,231,217,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
