Have you heard that volumes four and five, A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons, cover the same time period but split up the characters, so that most of the people who appear in Feast donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t show up in Dance and vice versa? Do you think youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be one of the people that finds this really frustrating? (IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not, I was perfectly happy with the books as-is and recommend them as such, but I know yÃ¢â‚¬â„¢all are out there.) Are you interested in recombining the two halves of the story in hopes that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll make for a more satisfying reading experience?\n\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin famously took years to finish Feast after Storm came out, and infamously took even more years to finish Dance after Feast came out. As we know, this came down to several problems. First, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d intended to have a five-year jump in the narrative following the conclusion of Storm, but after about a year of writing he realized it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t working and had to start over. Then, once heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d started over, he discovered that while the five-year jump didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work for most of the storylines, it worked really well for a few, and it was hard to get them right without it. Then he realized that he had way too many characters and way too much story to fit in one volume as planned, and he needed to decide how to split one volume into two Ã¢â‚¬â€œ should he tell half the story for all the characters, or (nearly) all the story for half the characters? (He chose the latter solution.) Finally, he struggled with something called Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Meereenese Knot.&quot; To discuss this IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d have to get a little bit spoilery, but it boiled down to how to get a whole bunch of characters to the place where a certain other character was, and in what order, and whether to have all of them get there by the end of Dance, and what to do with the character toward whom theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re traveling while theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re on their way. \n\nRight now, for the first time, the only real-world delay necessary to endure between reading, say, JonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last chapter in Storm and his first in Dance is the amount of time it takes you to read the entirety of Feast and get to the beginning of Dance after youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve finished Storm, since Martin split the characters up between the two books.\n\nBut since we now have access to both books at once, whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to stop us from folding the stories back together re-reading Feast and Dance simultaneously?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ca9c654fbcfe952da8bf53fa45f754e3140b94a","amp;dn":"Combined+Feast+for+Crows+and+A+Dance+with+Dragons+Roy+Dotrice.7z","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ca9c654fbcfe952da8bf53fa45f754e3140b94a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,169,198,84,251,207,233,82,218,139,245,63,164,95,117,78,49,64,185,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
