Their undeniably funny lyrics and on-stage antics might have suggested a simple troupe of clowns, but Coasters records were no mere novelties -- their material, supplied by the legendary team of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, was too witty, their arrangements too well-crafted, and the group itself too musically proficient. That engaging and infectious combination made them one of the most popular early R&amp;B/rock &amp; roll acts, as well as one of the most consistently entertaining doo wop/vocal groups of all time. \n\nGenre................: Oldies Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Rhino\nIncluded.............: Covers, Lossless Audiochecker, Accurip Log, Cue\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.Riot In Cell Block #9\n02.Wrap It Up\n03.Framed\n04.Whadaya Want\n05.One Kiss\n06.I Must Be Dreamin'\n07.The Hatchet Man\n08.Just Like A Fool\n09.Smokey Joe's Cafe\n10.Turtle Dovin'\n11.Down In Mexico\n12.One Kiss Led To Another\n13.Brazil\n14.Searchin'\n15.Young Blood\n16.Idol With The Golden Head\n17.(When She Wants Good Lovin') My Baby Comes To Me\n18.What Is The Secret Of Your Success\n19.Sweet Georgia Brown\n20.Yakety Yak\n21.Zing!
