One of the most successful popular\nsingers in history, he was dubbed the &quot;King of Calypso,&quot; a title which he was very reluctant to accept (according to the documentary Calypso Dreams) for popularizing the Caribbean musical style with an international audience in the 1950s. Belafonte is perhaps best known for singing the &quot;Banana Boat Song&quot;, with its signature lyric &quot;Day-O&quot;. Throughout his career, he has been an advocate for civil rights and humanitarian causes. He was a vocal critic of the policies of the Bush Administration.\nHarry Belafonte received the Kennedy Center Honors in 1989. He was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 1994 and he won a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in globally through the 1950s to the 2000s. He gave his last concert in 2003, and in a 2007 interview stated that he has since retired from performing.\n(Source Wikipedia)\n\nThese four CDÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s is a release from ReaderÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s Digest with the title\nThe Very Best Of Harry Belafonte. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.akh.se/harbel/b93001.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.akh.se/harbel/b93001.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n; Generated with Mp3tag v2.43\n; http://www.mp3tag.de\n1993  The Very Best of Harry Belafonte CD1 BelafonteÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s Greatest Hits, Try To Remember\n01  Day-O (Banana Boat Song)  1955 - Harry Belafonte\n02  Island In The Sun  1957 - Harry Belafonte\n03  Matilda, Matilda  1957 - Harry Belafonte\n04  Hava Nageela  1956 - Harry Belafonte\n05  Shenandoah  1956 - Harry Belafonte\n06  Come Back Liza  1957 - Harry Belafonte\n07  La Bamba  1960 - Harry Belafonte\n08  Angelina  1961 - Harry Belafonte\n09  Scarlet Ribbons (For Her Hair)  1956 - Harry Belafonte\n10  Jamaica Farewell  1955 - Harry Belafonte\n11  Try To Remember  1961 - Harry Belafonte\n12  Unchained Melody  1955 - Harry Belafonte\n13  Scarborough Fair/Canticle  1970 - Harry Belafonte\n14  Waltzing Mathilda  1963 - Harry Belafonte\n15  Sylvie  1959 (with the Norman Luboff Choir) - Harry Belafonte\n16  Delia  1967 - Harry Belafonte\n17  If I Were A Carpenter  1969 - Harry Belafonte\n18  Mr. Bojangles  1975 - Harry Belafonte\n19  Midnight Special  1962 - Harry Belafonte\n20  Michael Row The Boat Ashore  1962 - Harry Belafonte\n\n1993  The Very Best of Harry Belafonte CD2 The King Of Calypso, Favourite Requests\n01  Cocoanut Woman  1957 - Harry Belafonte\n02  Jump in the Line  1961 - Harry Belafonte\n03  Brown Skin Girl  1956 - Harry Belafonte\n04  Will His Love Be Like His Rum  1956 - Harry Belafonte\n05  Goin' Down Jordan  1961 - Harry Belafonte\n06  Zombie Jamboree (Back to Back)  1966 - Harry Belafonte\n07  Jump Down, Spin Around  1956 - Harry Belafonte\n08  Mama Look a Boo-Boo (Shut Your Mouth - Go Away)  1957 - Harry Belafonte\n09  Dolly Dawn  1956 - Harry Belafonte\n10  Kingston Market  1961 - Harry Belafonte\n11  Man Smart (Woman Smarter)  1956 - Harry Belafonte\n12  Round the Bay of Mexico  1959 - Harry Belafonte\n13  Don't Ever Love Me  1957 - Harry Belafonte\n14  God Bless the Child   - Harry Belafonte\n15  Cotton Fields  1958 - Harry Belafonte\n16  Hosanna  1962 - Harry Belafonte\n17  I Do Adore Her  1956 - Harry Belafonte\n18  Haiti Cherie  1957 - Harry Belafonte\n19  Muleskinner  1962 - Harry Belafonte\n20  Hallelujah, I Love her So  1958 - Harry Belafonte\n21  A Day in the Life of a Fool  1968 - Harry Belafonte\n\n1993  The Very Best of Harry Belafonte CD3 Songs From All Over The World, And I Love You So\n01  Danny Boy - Harry Belafonte\n02  This land Is Your Land - Harry Belafonte\n03  Merci Bon Dieu - Harry Belafonte\n04  Hen  Ma Tov - Harry Belafonte\n05  Walking on the Moon - Harry Belafonte\n06  If You Are Thirsty with Nana Mouskouri - Harry Belafonte\n07  The Wide Sea - Harry Belafonte\n08  Train Song with Miriam Makeba - Harry Belafonte\n09  On Top of Old Smokey - Harry Belafonte\n10  In the Evenin' Mama - Harry Belafonte\n11  And I Love You So - Harry Belafonte\n12  Suzanne - Harry Belafonte\n13  The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face - Harry Belafonte\n14  By the Time I Get to Phoenix - Harry Belafonte\n15  Marianne - Harry Belafonte\n16  The Circle game - Harry Belafonte\n17  Softly - Harry Belafonte\n18  Four Strong Winds - Harry Belafonte\n19  Hush, Hush (Thula, Thula) - Harry Belafonte\n20  Homeward Bound - Harry Belafonte\n\n1993  The Very Best of Harry Belafonte CD4 When The Saints Go Marching In, An Evening With Belafonte And Friends\n01  My Lord What a Morning - Harry Belafonte\n02  Swing Low Sweet Chariot - Harry Belafonte\n03  Steal Away - Harry Belafonte\n04  Were You There When They Crucified My Lord? - Harry Belafonte\n05  All My Trials - Harry Belafonte\n06  Bulked And Scorned - Harry Belafonte\n07  Abraham, Martin and John - Harry Belafonte\n08  Amen - Harry Belafonte\n09  When the Saints Go Marching In - Harry Belafonte\n10  Darlin' Cora - Harry Belafonte\n11  Cucurucucu Paloma - Harry Belafonte\n12  Don't Stop the Carnival - Harry Belafonte\n13  Man Piaba - Harry Belafonte\n14  The Click Song with Miriam Makeba - Harry Belafonte\n15  One More Dance with Miriam Makeba - Harry Belafonte\n16  Irene with Nana Mouskouri - Harry Belafonte\n17  A Hole in the Bucket with Odetta - Harry Belafonte","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01539e3eaedba8a5ffc9d542d043d708a3f99f0b","amp;dn":"The+Very+Best+Of+Harry+Belafonte+vol+1-4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01539e3eaedba8a5ffc9d542d043d708a3f99f0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,83,158,62,174,219,168,165,255,201,213,66,208,67,215,8,163,249,159,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
