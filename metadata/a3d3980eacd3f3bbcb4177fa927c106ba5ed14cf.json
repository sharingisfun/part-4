I decided to make a torrent out of it cause sometimes going to any of the sites that advertise this you have to go through a gauntlet of BS and ad/malware to try to get it. At least from here, if you get music from me you know my torrents are clean and I am a trusted uploader at many popular indexes. And just like the music I upload this is what I like, and use every day, In fact even as I type its busy giving the peeps the music I love.\r\n\r\n(Problems with magnets links and Bloatware are fixed by downgrading your torrent client to utorrent 2.2.1!)\r\n\r\nWhat can I say Im a music uploader, and I have had to answer some different questions from the peeps.\r\n\r\nWell a few of the most common ones are: What torrent client is best?\r\nAnd which one do you use?\r\nAlong with who is favorite band, that's the tough one ,there are so many great bands, but for torrent client that's easy cause there is only one.\r\n\r\nWell this is the answer to two of those questions: utorrent 2.2.1\r\n\r\nAnd its the same answer that you will get from most of your serious uploaders.\r\nIt don't crash often and it can handle a massive amount of torrent activity.\r\n\r\nBoth uploading and dcwnloading.\r\n\r\nI have run it at its limit just so I could know how far I could take it. And it went A lot farther than the designers ever envisioned. They created the best. And just look at every POS that has followed. They cant make it any better and jam it with bloatware. They cant even match it. I used some of the 3. versions and all that did for me was freeze or crash constantly.\r\nIm sure my Hdd was made dead from that. (It was)\r\nSince then reinstalled 2.2.1 I have had no more problems with disk overload/freeze/crash.\r\n\r\nIt can handle a prolonged load without problems anywhere from 700-1000 active torrents.\r\n\r\nI don't recommend a new user to try that.\r\nAnd most will never go past 20-50.\r\n\r\nIts not a media center, This is the best torrent client for sharing, it is the tool of the filesharing trade.\r\nIf you want a MC get one.\r\nThis is a torrent client, It will allow you to play the finished torrents.\r\nAnd if you have good enough speed you can stream music or videos.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway I have posted this, get it if you want.\r\nJust ask anyone that knows and this or one of the other builds from the 2,0 series are the answer and No, this one did not and does not have the advertising that came in the 3. models and up. And nobody is mining anything...ugh!\r\nimage\r\nEnough, get it already, and one more piece of advice: bitcomet is not the one Avoid it.\r\nStick to lil utorrant 2.2.1\r\nand you will avoid the problems that are endlessly irritating those who don't.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and seed if ya want. WAIT! Just one last thing, that ad that says upgrade your torrant client. That's incorrect.\r\nThis is the answer. So trouble with magnet links and torrenting? Downgrade that piece of bloatware and go with 2.2.1(recommended)\r\nAny questions will be addressed. But I don't expect many cause this lil client is the one I use at all the indexes I share with.....\r\nanalogkid6103","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3d3980eacd3f3bbcb4177fa927c106ba5ed14cf","amp;dn":"Utorrent++2.2.1+-+Build+25110.exe+%28recommended%29++ak+torrent","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3d3980eacd3f3bbcb4177fa927c106ba5ed14cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,211,152,14,172,211,243,187,203,65,119,250,146,124,16,107,165,237,20,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
