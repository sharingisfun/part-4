Campbell Memorial Award Nominee for Best Science Fiction Novel (2007)\n\nEighty years in the future, Earth becomes aware of an alien presence when thousands of micro-satellites survey the Earth; through good luck, the incoming alien vessel is detected, and the ship Theseus, with its artificial intelligence captain and crew of five, are sent out to engage in first contact with the huge alien vessel called Rorschach.\nAs they explore the vessel and attempt to analyze it and its inhabitants, the narrator, Siri, considers his life and strives to understand himself and ponders the nature of intelligence and consciousness, their utility, and what an alien mind might be like. Eventually the crew realizes that they are greatly outmatched by the vessel and its unconscious but extremely capable inhabitants.\nWhen the level of this threat becomes clear, Theseus runs a kamikaze mission using its antimatter as a payload, while Siri returns to Earth, which he eventually realizes has been overrun by vampires, and that non-sentient creatures are beginning to exterminate what may be the only spark of consciousness in the universe.\n\nRead by T. Ryder Smith\nFormat: MP3\nUnabridged\nRun time: 11 hours and 47 min.\n\nThe end of this book wasnt recorded in the audiobook.\nif you want know what happend goto http://rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c208b8048f4ffcb587d82bdb01f66d110b4fff5","amp;dn":"Peter+Watts+-+Blindsight+%28Firefall+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c208b8048f4ffcb587d82bdb01f66d110b4fff5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,32,139,128,72,244,255,203,88,125,130,189,176,31,102,209,16,180,255,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
