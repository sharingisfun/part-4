The album is notably more upbeat than her previous work, which she partly attributes to her relationship with JD Samson as well as her childhood influences Cyndi Lauper and Madonna. The album's first single, &quot;You've Changed&quot; was released in December 2009 and the second, &quot;Clap Your Hands&quot;, in April 2010.\n\n\n\n\nTracklist\n__________________________\n\n1)&quot;The Fight&quot;\n2)&quot;Clap Your Hands&quot;\n3)&quot;Stop Trying&quot;\n4)&quot;You've Changed&quot; \n5)&quot;Be Good to Me&quot;\n6)&quot;Bring Night&quot;\n7)&quot;Hurting Me Now&quot;\n8)&quot;Never Gonna Leave Me&quot;\n9)&quot;Cloud&quot;\n10)&quot;I'm in Here&quot;\n11)&quot;The Co-Dependent&quot;\n12)&quot;Big Girl, Little Girl&quot;\n13)&quot;Oh Father&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4840c97c775f9c811a47290ea97237c76fe8c1c7","amp;dn":"Sia+-+We+Are+Born+%5B2010-MP3%5D%5BSspankyy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4840c97c775f9c811a47290ea97237c76fe8c1c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,64,201,124,119,95,156,129,26,71,41,14,169,114,55,199,111,232,193,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
