This was the first part of Wenders' &quot;Road Movie Trilogy&quot; which included The Wrong Move (1975) and Kings of the Road (1976). The film is shot in black and white by Robby MÃƒÂ¼ller with several long scenes without dialogue. The film's theme closely foreshadows Wenders' later film Paris, Texas.\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/5X5GULz.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/SjSwnzx.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/rG0h4bB.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0313263c1cef0d069d5f29de503d5aaa9b7678b","amp;dn":"Alice+in+the+cities+-+Wim+Wenders+%281973%29+%5BH264+-+Deu+Ac3+-+Sub+E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0313263c1cef0d069d5f29de503d5aaa9b7678b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,49,50,99,193,206,240,208,105,213,242,157,229,3,213,170,169,183,103,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
