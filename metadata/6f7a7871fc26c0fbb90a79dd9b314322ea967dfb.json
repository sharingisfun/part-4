Pierre Brasseur plays a brilliant plastic surgeon, Prof. Genessier, who has vowed to restore the face of his daughter, Christiane (Edith Scob), who was mutilated in an automobile accident. With the help of his assistant (Alida Valli), he kidnaps young women, surgically removes their facial features, and attempts to graft their beauty onto his daughter's hideous countenance. This naturally has an adverse effect on the &quot;donors,&quot; some of whom commit suicide rather than go through life faceless. Franju's haunting, muted handling of basic horror material is what lifts Eyes Without a Face out of the ordinary and into the realm of near-classic. When the film failed to draw crowds under its original title, however, the distributors decided to exploit it as a two-bit &quot;scare&quot; flick with the new title The Horror Chamber of Dr. Faustus. \n\nFile Name .........................................: Les yeux sans visage.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,314,277,376 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:30:37\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 664x392 (AR: 1.694)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1732 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.278 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [1 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053459/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053459/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: French\nSubtitles: English, Spanish and Portuguese\n\nMy rip of the Criterion DVD\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f7a7871fc26c0fbb90a79dd9b314322ea967dfb","amp;dn":"Georges+Franju+-+Les+yeux+sans+visage+%5BEyes+Without+a+Face%5D+%28196","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f7a7871fc26c0fbb90a79dd9b314322ea967dfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,122,120,113,252,38,192,251,185,10,121,221,155,49,67,34,234,150,125,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
