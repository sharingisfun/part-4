Like The Number of the Beast and, later, Fear of the Dark and The Final Frontier, it debuted at No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart. It also marks the first appearance of many progressive rock elements which would be used frequently in later albums, seen in the length and odd time signatures of the title track &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot;, and by the fact that it is a concept album.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n1. \t&quot;Moonchild&quot;   \tAdrian Smith, Bruce Dickinson \t5:38\n2. \t&quot;Infinite Dreams&quot;   \tSteve Harris \t6:08\n3. \t&quot;Can I Play with Madness&quot;   \tSmith, Dickinson, Harris \t3:30\n4. \t&quot;The Evil That Men Do&quot;   \tSmith, Dickinson, Harris \t4:33\t\n5. \t&quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot;   \tHarris \t9:52\n6. \t&quot;The Prophecy&quot;   \tDave Murray, Harris \t5:04\n7. \t&quot;The Clairvoyant&quot;   \tHarris \t4:26\n8. \t&quot;Only the Good Die Young&quot;   \tHarris, Dickinson \t4:40\n\nBonus Disc [320k MP3]\t\n\n1. \t&quot;Black Bart Blues&quot;   \tHarris, Dickinson \t6:41\n2. \t&quot;Massacre&quot; (Thin Lizzy cover) \t\t2:53\n3. \t&quot;Prowler '88&quot;   \tHarris \t4:07\n4. \t&quot;Charlotte the Harlot 88&quot;   \tMurray \t4:11\n5. \t&quot;Infinite Dreams&quot; (live) \tHarris \t6:03\n6. \t&quot;The Clairvoyant&quot; (live) \tHarris \t4:27\n7. \t&quot;The Prisoner&quot; (live) \tSmith, Harris \t6:09\n8. \t&quot;Killers&quot; (live) \tHarris, Paul Di'Anno \t5:03\n9. \t&quot;Still Life&quot; (live) \tMurray, Harris \t4:38","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d69eba63a7af0c26eeef18be7946c741f41d828","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+Seventh+Son+Of+A+Seventh+Son+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d69eba63a7af0c26eeef18be7946c741f41d828","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,105,235,166,58,122,240,194,110,238,241,139,231,148,108,116,31,65,216,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
