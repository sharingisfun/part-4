The richness of the artistic explosion that Russia experienced between 1896 and 1932 does not permit here the treatment of the subject in its entire range.

The advent of nonobjective art had been preceded by a glorious symbolist period as well as by an extraordinary cubo-futurist flowering which could by itself constitute the subject of another book.
