Michael Corleone is nearly 60 and feeling tremendous guilt for indulging in his ruthless ambition over the years, especially for ordering the murder of his brother Fredo two decades before. Although his previous conquests have made him a very rich man, the thoughts of his children, their future, happiness, and his legacy are now his primary motivations, and he has all but retired from the Mafia, selling the Las Vegas casinos and leaving the Corleone family's criminal interests in the hands of former enforcer Joey Zasa. His adopted brother Tom Hagen is now dead and the Corleone compound at Lake Tahoe has been abandoned. Michael and Kay have been divorced since 1959, and Michael gave her custody of their children, Anthony and Mary. He has since returned to New York City, where he is using his wealth and power to restore his reputation via numerous acts of charity. In an attempt to break with the past, Michael creates a charity, the Vito Corleone Foundation, in memory of his father, which he has endowed with $100 million to use for the betterment of Sicily.\n\nAt a ceremony in St. Patrick's Old Cathedral, presided over by Archbishop Gilday, Michael is named a Commander of the Order of St. Sebastian. At a lavish party following the ceremony, Michael and Kay have a somewhat uneasy reunion. Anthony tells his father that he is going to drop out of law school to pursue a career as an opera singer (Kay reveals this as the &quot;only reason she came&quot; to the party). Kay supports his choice, but Michael initially disagrees, wishing that his son would either finish law school or join the family business. Anthony steadfastly refuses, stating that while he loves his father, he will never be part of the family business (much like Michael's initial relationship with his own father). Michael eventually, though somewhat reluctantly, acquiesces to Anthony's wishes.\n\nMeanwhile, Vincent Mancini, the illegitimate son of Michael's brother Sonny, shows up at the party. He is embroiled in a feud with Zasa, who has involved the Corleone family in drug trafficking and turned Little Italy into a slum. In Michael's study, Vincent and Zasa tell him about their feud. The discussion grows heated, with Vincent accusing Zasa of mocking Michael behind his back. Michael makes it clear that he is not a &quot;gangster&quot; and that whatever bad blood exists between Vincent and Zasa is none of his business, and must only be settled between them. He asks the two men to make peace with one another. They embrace, but Zasa insults Vincent by whispering the word &quot;bastardo&quot; in his ear. Enraged, Vincent bites off part of ZasaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ear. Zasa is escorted out and Michael scolds Vincent for losing his temper, but is nevertheless impressed by Vincent's passionate loyalty to him and agrees to take Vincent under his wing. The party concludes with a family picture, where Michael asks Vincent to join the rest of the family.\n\nThat night, as Vincent makes love with Grace Hamilton, a journalist he met at the party, two men break in and try to kill him. Vincent quickly gains the upper hand, and kills one in order to frighten the other into revealing that Zasa is the man who sent them. Once the second assassin has surrendered, Vincent kills him, too. When Michael learns of Vincent's actions, he again chastises him, telling him that he could have let them live as &quot;he only had a knife...you had a gun.&quot; Meanwhile, Michael busies himself with the biggest deal of his career: he has recently bought up enough stock in Immobiliare, an international real estate holding company known as &quot;the world's biggest landlord&quot;, to control six of the company's 13-member board of directors. He now makes a tender offer to buy the Vatican's 25% interest in the company, which will give him majority control. Knowing that Archbishop Gilday, who serves as head of the Vatican Bank, has run up a massive deficit through his mismanagement, he offers to pay $600 million to the Bank in exchange for the shares. While in the Vatican, Michael learns that several influential parties oppose the deal for many reasons, not the least of which is his extensive criminal history.\n\nDon Altobello, an elderly New York Mafia boss and old friend of the Corleones (as well as Connie's godfather), soon visits Michael, telling him that his old partners on the Commission want in on the Immobiliare deal. A meeting is arranged at an Atlantic City hotel, and Michael appeases most of the Mafia bosses with generous payoffs from the sale of his Las Vegas holdings. Zasa, however, gets nothing. Furious, he declares that Michael is his enemy and storms out. Altobello follows close behind, allegedly attempting to calm him down. Minutes later, a helicopter hovers outside the conference room and sprays it with submachine gun fire. Most of the other mob bosses are killed, but Michael, Vincent, and Michael's bodyguard, Al Neri, escape. Back at his apartment in New York, Michael is told that those mob bosses who escaped the massacre quickly made deals with Zasa, and comes to the realization that Altobello was the boss who supported Zasa in carrying out the hit. As Michael considers how to respond to the situation, he suffers a diabetic stroke and is hospitalized. In his delirium, Michael cries out Fredo's name shortly before he is loaded on an ambulance to the hospital.\n\nAs Michael recuperates in the hospital, Vincent begins a romantic relationship with Mary, despite being first cousins, and also plots revenge against Joey Zasa. During a street festival hosted by Zasa's Italian American civil rights group, Vincent's men gun down Zasa's bodyguards. Vincent, disguised as a mounted police officer, then murders Zasa himself. When Michael discovers this, he berates Vincent for his rashness. Michael also insists that Vincent end his relationship with Mary, because Vincent's involvement in the family's criminal dealings puts Mary's life in jeopardy. Vincent agrees.\n\nThe family takes a vacation to Sicily in March of 1980, in preparation for Anthony's operatic debut in Palermo. They stay at the villa of Don Tommasino, the Mafia boss who sheltered Michael when he was on the run in the first film. Michael tells Vincent to speak with Altobello and falsely tell him that he is planning to leave the Corleone family. Altobello supports the idea of Vincent switching his allegiance, and introduces him to Don Licio Lucchesi, a powerful Italian political figure. Michael realizes that the Immobiliare deal was a conspiracy by Lucchesi, Archbishop Gilday, and Vatican accountant Frederick Keinszig to swindle him out of his money, and visits Cardinal Lamberto, the man favoured to become the next Pope, to speak about the deal. Lamberto convinces Michael to make his first confession after nearly thirty years, in which he tearfully admits to ordering Fredo's murder.\n\nShortly after the meeting between Vincent and Lucchesi, Altobello travels to the small village of Montelepre, where he meets Mosca, an elderly, veteran hitman with whom he has previously done business. Altobello hires Mosca and his son, Lupe, to assassinate Michael, saying, &quot;I have a stone in my shoe. You can remove it.&quot; A few days later, Mosca and Lupe, disguised as priests, make their move, attempting to hijack Don Tommasino and force him to allow them entry to his villa. Tommasino refuses, and Mosca kills him with a lupara. Touring Sicily with Kay, who has arrived for AnthonyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s operatic debut, Michael asks for her forgiveness. As they both admit that they still love each other, Michael receives word that Tommasino is dead.\n\nAfter the death of Pope Paul VI, Cardinal Lamberto is elected Pope John Paul I, which means that the Immobiliare deal will likely be ratified, due to his intention to &quot;clean up&quot; the dealings of the Vatican. The new Pope's intentions come as a death knell to the plot against the ratification of the Immobiliare deal, prompting frantic attempts by the plotters to cover their own tracks. Vincent tells Michael that he has learned from Altobello of Mosca's plot on his life. Vincent wants to strike back, but Michael cautions him, saying that if he goes ahead with such a plan, there will be no turning back. Vincent insists on revenge, and Michael relents. He makes Vincent the new don of the Corleone family, telling him, &quot;Nephew, from this moment on, call yourself Vincent Corleone.&quot; In exchange, Vincent agrees to finally put an end to his relationship with Mary. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099674/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099674/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPLEASE SEED AND ENJOY THANKS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:263e981b9b9e987e2052678c31a530af47869a93","amp;dn":"THE-GODFATHER.Part-3.DVDrip%5Bvice%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"263e981b9b9e987e2052678c31a530af47869a93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,62,152,27,155,158,152,126,32,82,103,140,49,165,48,175,71,134,154,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
