This series lasted for only 1 season, as they cancelled it due to then immense popularity of Pokemon. Shame! I really liked the plot in this one, not to mention his suit :D\n\nDownload, seed and enjoy :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c23e27c5e1193f1bf6d2791e42af60818e4299df","amp;dn":"Spiderman+Unlimited+Series+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c23e27c5e1193f1bf6d2791e42af60818e4299df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,62,39,197,225,25,63,27,246,210,121,30,66,175,96,129,142,66,153,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
