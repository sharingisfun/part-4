Academy Award-winning actor Colin Firth (The KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Speech, A Single Man) turns in an authentic and stirring performance for this distinguished audio release.\n\nThe End of the Affair, set in London during and just after World War II, is the story of a flourishing love affair between Maurice Bendrix and Sarah Miles. After a violent episode at MauriceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s apartment, Sarah suddenly and without explanation breaks off the affair. This very intimate story about what actually constitutes love is enhanced by Mr. FirthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s narration, who said Ã¢â‚¬Å“this book struck me very, very particularly at the time when I read it and I thought my familiarity with it would give the journey a personal slant.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0a802cb79d2e76705ce6b0d7d1aa003a3bba800","amp;dn":"The+End+of+the+Affair+by+Graham+Greene+read+by+Colin+Firth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0a802cb79d2e76705ce6b0d7d1aa003a3bba800","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,168,2,203,121,210,231,103,5,206,107,13,125,26,160,3,163,187,168,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
