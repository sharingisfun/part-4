Take a less than serious look at the 'business' of organized crime with this hilarious game. If you fancy becoming a 'made man' and impress the Godfather with your hoodlum antics then this game will keep you glued to the screen. Deal with gangsters, murder and bribery. See how a gang war background can be cool and inoffensive at the same time, despite the violent content. Humorous undertones just won't let you take things too seriously.\n\nBonus content: manual, soundtrack.\n\nHow to play:\n1) Run setup_mob_rule.exe and install the game;\n2) Launch the game using its main executable or shortcuts (DRM free).\n\n! Notice\nIf the game screen scrolls too fast, set the game executable MR.exe to run in compatibility mode for Windows 98.\n\nIf you like the game, BUY it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1f1b969e86402b7f538b68f9be9d4f030090e7d","amp;dn":"Mob++Rule++GOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1f1b969e86402b7f538b68f9be9d4f030090e7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,241,185,105,232,100,2,183,245,56,182,143,155,233,212,240,48,9,14,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
