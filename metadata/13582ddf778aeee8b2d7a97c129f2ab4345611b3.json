Weaving the history of science and technology with the fortunes of war and the stories of men and women whose discoveries brought both benefits and destruction to the world, Hitler's Scientists raises questions that are still urgent today. As science becomes embroiled in new generations of weapons of mass destruction and the war against terrorism, as advances in biotechnology outstrip traditional ethics, this powerful account of Nazi science forms a crucial commentary on the ethical role of science.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13582ddf778aeee8b2d7a97c129f2ab4345611b3","amp;dn":"Hitler%27s+Scientists%3A+Science%2C+War%2C+and+the+Devil%27s+Pact","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13582ddf778aeee8b2d7a97c129f2ab4345611b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,88,45,223,119,138,238,232,178,215,169,124,18,159,42,180,52,86,17,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
