As a portrait painter, as a creator of menacing and melancholy images in oils, as a master of enigmatic, satirical and revolutionary drawing and engraving, as the champion of the Spanish people in their struggle against oppression, and the recorder of their life and customs and their sufferings in war, he is known and appreciated everywhere. The aim of this new anthology is to bring out the many moods of this great artist, from the gaiety and tenderness of the Tapestry Cartoons, such as the Boys blowing up a balloon, to the mysterious ferocity of the late Black Paintings. Many of Goya's most famous pictures are reproduced - the two versions of the Maja, The 3rd of May and The Family of Charles IV, which is shown in its newly restored and pristine state - but there are also many less well known masterpieces : including the portraits of the actress, Antonia Zarate, and the architect Juan Antonio Cuervo, and The Forge, whose uninhibited technique and candid imagery anticipate so much modern painting","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03100a7a024e908b2b8fff76fb2c76d85735d5b3","amp;dn":"Goya+%28Phaidon+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03100a7a024e908b2b8fff76fb2c76d85735d5b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,16,10,122,2,78,144,139,43,143,255,118,251,44,118,216,87,53,213,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
