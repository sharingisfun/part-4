Unfortunately she wants to move the franchise to Miami and a losing season is her only ticket to Florida. So she signs the wildest gang of screwballs that ever spit tobacco. They're handsome but they're hopeless! Her catcher (Tom Berenger) is a washed-up womanizer who struck out in life. Her ace pitcher (Charlie Sheen) is a punked-out crazy who struck out with the law. And her third baseman (Corbin Bernsen) is more concerned fielding endorsements than grounders. Throw in a busload of other misfits and you ve got yourself a hilarious line-up that's destined for disaster!\n\n  Starring: Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, Corbin Bernsen, Margaret Whitton, James Gammon, Wesley Snipes.\n\n  Directed by: David S.
