Everyone knows the name of\nCommissioner Gordon. But what of his rise from rookie detective to Police\nCommissioner? What did it take to navigate the layers of corruption in\nGotham City, the spawning ground of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most iconic villains?\nGOTHAM is the origin story of the great DC Comics Super-Villains and\nvigilantes, revealing an entirely new chapter that has never been told.\nFrom executive producer Bruno Heller, this crime drama follows one cop's\nrise through a dangerously corrupt city and chronicles the genesis of one\nof the most popular super heroes of our time. Although the crime drama\nfollows Gordon's turbulent and singular career, it also focuses on his\nunlikely friendship with the young heir to the Wayne fortune - a friendship\nthat will play a crucial role in helping the young boy eventually become\nthe crusader he's destined to be.\n\nProduced by DC Entertainment and Warner Bros.
