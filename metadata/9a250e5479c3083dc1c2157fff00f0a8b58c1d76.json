A.K. details\nKurosawa's meticulous directorial role. The film is filmed exclusively in the\nfoothills of Mount Fuji, the setting for Ran. Marker film opens with Kurosawa's\nproclamation: &quot;I always say to my crew, to create is to remember. Memory\nis the basis of everything.&quot; Marker evokes the fist of this phrase almost a\ndecade later when in an epigraph to The Last Bolshevik he quotes George\nSteiner: &quot; It is not the the literal past tat rules us. It is images of the past.&quot;\nA.K. details the production of visual spectacle based on memory, exploring\nhow images of history are artfully created and crafted. For instance, the\nfilm reveals that Kurosawa always set up three cameras to record three\ndifferent angles that could later be edited together. Marker's documentary\nfootage establishes one more perspective. Furthermore, his images, shot\nin 35mm, rival those of Kurosawa. But, whereas Ran plunges us into a\nmedieval world of shoguns, samurai and beautiful horses, A.K. portrais the\nworkers of the film industry and depicts a very contemporary scenery of\ncars, trailers and scaffolding. It also captures the lenghty preparations, the\nboredom of waiting for optimal weather conditions, and the tedious process\nof waiting for the actors and the crew to get into position. In short, Marker's\nfilm focuses specifically on the extensive labor that goes into making the\nmagic of a film. As such, A.K. is essentially an essayistic homage to a style\nof filmmaking that is radically different from Marker's own and yet one that\nhe evidently respects and admires.\n\nName.......................: A.K.
