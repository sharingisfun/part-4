Instead, the Chi-Lites were from Chicago, a town better known for its gritty urban blues and driving R&amp;B. Led by vocalist Eugene Record, the Chi-Lites had a lush, creamy sound distinguished by their four-part harmonies and layered productions. During the early '70s, they racked up 11 Top Ten R&amp;B singles, ranging from the romantic ballads &quot;Have You Seen Her&quot; and &quot;Oh Girl&quot; to protest songs like &quot;(For God's Sake) Give More Power to the People&quot; and &quot;There Will Never Be Any Peace (Until God Is Seated at the Conference Table).&quot; All the songs featured Record's warm, pleading tenor and falsetto, and the majority of the group's hits were written by Record, often in collaboration with other songwriters like Barbara Acklin. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Oh Girl\n02.Give It Away\n03.We Are Neighbors\n04.Let Me Be The Man My Daddy Was\n05.Have You Seen Her\n06.24 Hours Of Sadness\n07.(For God's Sake) Give More Power To The People\n08.The Coldest Days Of My Life\n09.What Do I Wish For\n10.I Want To Pay You Back (For Loving Me)\n11.Stoned Out Of My Mind\n12.A Letter To Myself\n13.There Will Never Be Any Peace (Until God Is Seated At The ...)\n14.I Found Sunshine\n15.Toby\n16.Homely Girl\n17.We Need Order\n18.Are You My Woman (Tell Me So)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:514dae9b667f24332247c38f6fc976a355b0aab6","amp;dn":"The+Chi-Lites+-+Greatest+Hits+%281992%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"514dae9b667f24332247c38f6fc976a355b0aab6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,77,174,155,102,127,36,51,34,71,195,143,111,201,118,163,85,176,170,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
