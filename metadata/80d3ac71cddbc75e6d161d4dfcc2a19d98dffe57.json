No one got along better than these two catgirls when they were younger, but lately, they've been fighting all the time.\r\n\r\nDespite their sisterly love, a small misunderstanding ends up driving a wedge between them. As the story of these catgirl sisters unfolds, they'll grow to understand each other and strengthen their familial bonds in this heartfelt catgirl comedy, which is only a little lewd. Now open for business!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80d3ac71cddbc75e6d161d4dfcc2a19d98dffe57","amp;dn":"NEKOPARA+Vol.+2-HI2U","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80d3ac71cddbc75e6d161d4dfcc2a19d98dffe57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,211,172,113,205,219,199,94,109,22,29,77,252,194,161,157,152,223,254,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
