It is particularly interesting to hear material recorded live in 1966: the songs are introduced with stories relating to the black experience in America, told with the same engagement with which Rawls sings, and the rapport with the audience is apparent even on disc. \nThis CD in combination with its follow-up of newly recorded material, Portrait of the Blues, comprise a full education on get-dressed-up urban(e) blues.
