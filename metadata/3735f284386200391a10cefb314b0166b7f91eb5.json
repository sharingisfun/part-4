Applying its sinuous, curvilinear motifs to the decorative arts, graphics, architecture, sculpture, and painting, artists and crafters attempted to create a style suitable for a &quot;modern&quot; age.\r\nThis treasury of rare Art Nouveau decorative ornaments offers an unusual selection of the genre's most strikingly imaginative graphics. Originally published in Paris in 1899 and sold by subscription, the collection features fifty full-page plates depicting a rich profusion of everyday items rendered in the distinctive Art Nouveau style. Intricate patterns of flowers, vines, faces, and other designs decorate scores of objects made of metal, ceramic, and glass: pitchers and vases, cutlery, walking sticks, jewelry, and other objects and artifacts. A source of authentic Art Nouveau graphics, this compilation will serve as an inspiration for artists, illustrators, and designers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3735f284386200391a10cefb314b0166b7f91eb5","amp;dn":"Art+Nouveau+-+Objects+and+Artifacts+%282015%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3735f284386200391a10cefb314b0166b7f91eb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,53,242,132,56,98,0,57,26,16,206,251,49,75,1,102,183,249,30,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
