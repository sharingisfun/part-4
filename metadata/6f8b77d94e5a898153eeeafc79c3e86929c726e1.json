As the camera moves from one viewpoint to another, the specimen appears to rotate in space, letting the viewer experience it as a three-dimensional object. Acland's DVD Atlas uses fresh, un-embalmed specimens that retain the color, texture, mobilityÃ¢â‚¬â€and beautyÃ¢â‚¬â€of the living human body.\n\nA concise synchronized narration runs throughout the program. As each new structure is shown, its name appears on the screen. There is a self-testing feature at the end of each section. Specific content can be accessed through detailed searches of the index and table of contents.\n\nFor students, Acland's DVD Atlas is a time-saving aid to first-time learning, an effective way to relearn anatomy for clinical rotations, and a time-efficient tool for review. For clinicians in training and in practice, it assures a swift renewal of anatomic knowledge. For teachers, Acland's DVD Atlas shortens the time needed to provide immediate, satisfying explanations of three-dimensional structure.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f8b77d94e5a898153eeeafc79c3e86929c726e1","amp;dn":"Acland%27s+DVD+Atlas+of+Human+Anatomy+-+Extreme+Quality","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f8b77d94e5a898153eeeafc79c3e86929c726e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,139,119,217,78,90,137,129,83,238,234,252,121,195,232,105,41,199,38,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
