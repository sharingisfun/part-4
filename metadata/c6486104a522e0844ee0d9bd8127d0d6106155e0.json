Abercrombie's lines aren't nearly as freaky and fuzzy as Jimi's, but the groove here is a really nice change â€“ one that almost digs into the inherently soulful elements of Hendrix's music, then turns it further into a vehicle for jazz-based exploration! Marvin Smitty Smith is in drums â€“ and titles include &quot;Third Stone From The Sun&quot;, &quot;Foxy Lady&quot;, &quot;Castles Made Of Sand/Star Spangled Banner&quot;, and &quot;Jimi Meets Miles&quot;.\r\n\r\nThe resurrection of Lonnie Smith continues with this exciting mini-survey of the Jimi Hendrix legacy. This time, the material allows Smith's crackling, tightly knit collaborators, John Abercrombie and Marvin &quot;Smitty&quot; Smith, to run a bit wild â€“ indeed, Abercrombie's tone and attack takes on a Hendrix-like cast on the title track â€“ while Lonnie mostly remains in the same cool soul-jazz frame of mind, an excellent foil. \r\n\r\nThe most ambitious track, &quot;Castles Made of Sand,&quot; takes on a military rhythm before breaking out into Smitty's everywhere-at-once drum patterns, cooking at a fine boil through its 23 1/2-minute length before breaking into a suitably chaotic rendition of &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot; toward the end. On the latter, Abercrombie has a ball pouring on the sarcasm, and Lonnie bounces around the organ. \r\n\r\n&quot;Third Stone from the Sun&quot; moves at a casual, loping pace before Abercrombie and Smitty go into their guitar- and drum-slinger modes. Finally, there is a bit of fantasy in Lonnie's &quot;Jimi Meets Miles&quot; â€“ a musical event that nearly happened â€“ with Abercrombie doing a laconic Hendrix impression over a propulsive rhythm that recalls Miles' Bitches Brew period. \r\n\r\nA companion disc, Purple Haze (recorded the next day), is also available.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - Foxy Lady\r\n02 - Castles Made Of Sand - Star Spangled Banner\r\n03 - Third Stone From The Sun\r\n04 - Jimi Meets Miles\r\n\r\n*2011 Venus Records | VHCD-78232\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nLonnie Smith - organ\r\nJohn Abercrombie - electric guitar\r\nMarvin &quot;Smitty&quot; Smith - drums\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Lonnie Smith Album's.....\r\n\r\n\r\nLonnie Smith - Move Your Hand (1969) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9051597/Lonnie_Smith_-_Move_Your_Hand_%281969%29__[EAC-FLAC]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lonnie Smith = John Abercrombie Trio - Afro Blue (1994) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9061329/Lonnie_Smith___John_Abercrombie_Trio_-_Afro_Blue_%281994%29_[EAC-FLA\r\n\r\n\r\nLonnie Smith - Live At Club Mozambique (1970) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/12662242/Lonnie_Smith_-_Live_At_Club_Mozambique_%281970%29_[EAC-FLAC]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6486104a522e0844ee0d9bd8127d0d6106155e0","amp;dn":"Lonnie+Smith+Trio+-+Foxy+Lady+-+Tribute+To+Jimi+Hendrix+%281994%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6486104a522e0844ee0d9bd8127d0d6106155e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,72,97,4,165,34,224,132,78,224,217,189,129,39,208,214,16,97,85,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
