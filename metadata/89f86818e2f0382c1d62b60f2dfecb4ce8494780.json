Author Matt Blumberg, a technology and marketing entrepreneur, knows this all too well. Back in 1999, he started a company called Return Path, which later became the driving force behind the creation of his blog, OnlyOnceÃ¢â‚¬â€because &quot;you're only a first time CEO once.&quot;\n\nNow, more than a decade later, he's written Startup CEO. As the fifth book in the StartUp Revolution series, this reliable resource is based on Blumberg's experience as a startup CEO and covers a number of issues he's faced over the dozen years he's been a CEO.\n\nOffers valuable insights into how the CEO sets the overall vision and strategy of the company and communicates it to all stakeholders\nDiscusses how to build a company's human capital by recruiting, hiring, and retaining the very best talent\nExamines how a CEO must align available resources with the company's strategy in order to ensure success\nAddresses what it takes to master the &quot;How&quot; of being a CEOÃ¢â‚¬â€from leading an executive team to managing in any type of market","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89f86818e2f0382c1d62b60f2dfecb4ce8494780","amp;dn":"Startup+CEO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89f86818e2f0382c1d62b60f2dfecb4ce8494780","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,248,104,24,226,240,56,44,29,98,182,15,45,254,203,76,232,73,71,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
