In late 2012, the band independently released a demo entitled Roman Acupuncture. Recently, BÃƒÂ¶lzer unleashed a 12 &quot; vinyl EP limited to a 1,000 copies simply entitled Aura. The album encompasses three studio compositions of a unique black metal/death metal mix.\n\nBÃƒÂ¶lzer produces the style of brutal Swiss death metal that hearkens back to the days when &quot;brutal&quot; was a descriptive adjective and not simply indicative of a particular subset of the genre. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a sort of cosmic churn to their pummelling, bestial underground metal, the type that exists in some other area before death and black, that puts you in mind of cavemen revering the stars. Think somewhere between Incantaion, early Immolation and Grave. They are well recognized for crafting dark and extremely memorable atmospheric tracks.
