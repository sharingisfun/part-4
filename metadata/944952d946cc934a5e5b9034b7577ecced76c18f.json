It is an adventure game. Each clay animation was painstakingly captured frame-by-frame.\n\nOwing to the quirky and wacky animation, silly characters and unusual music by composer Terry Scott Taylor, this award winning game has a cult following to this day, though it has been out of print and largely unavailable for years. As of 2007, there are numerous fansites devoted to The Neverhood. Its soundtrack, Imaginarium: Songs from the Neverhood, also continues to sell well.\n\nThe Neverhood received good reviews, but was not a commercial hit. By the mid-1990s adventure games had begun to decline in popularity. Several other adventure games made in this period such as Grim Fandango also received critical acclaim, but failed to sell well. The Neverhood was put in the official Microsoft list of underrated games.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:944952d946cc934a5e5b9034b7577ecced76c18f","amp;dn":"The+Neverhood+%2B+patch+%28english%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"944952d946cc934a5e5b9034b7577ecced76c18f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,73,82,217,70,204,147,74,94,91,144,52,183,87,126,204,237,118,193,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
