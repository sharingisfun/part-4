He becomes a well-respected leader in Egypt - so much so, that the Pharaoh even prefers him over his own son as a potential successor to the throne. But everything changes when he discovers the truth of his origin. Deciding his place is with his enslaved people, he is eventually banished - but an encounter with God turns him into a prophet. It is through this he discovers the secret of his existence - he is the &quot;chosen one&quot; of legend, the one whose destiny it is to free the Hebrews from bondage. \n  Overlong run time aside, the Ten Commandments is the quintessential biblical epic. The story is timeless, and DeMille's take on the classic tale is the definitive version. With its classic &quot;cast of thousands&quot; and the characters they portray, a gripping storyline, and a wonderful Bernstein score, it's truly a classic film. Of all the versions of the Ten Commandments ever put on film, DeMille's 1956 version is by far the best.\n\n  Starring: Charlton Heston, Yul Brynner, Anne Baxter, Edward G.
