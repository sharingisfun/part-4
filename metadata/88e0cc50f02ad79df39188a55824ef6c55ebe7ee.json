Edition)\n\n\n\nDescription :\nThis DVD is intended to compare the two DVD surrounds formats 5.1DD (448kbps) and DTS (1536kbps/768kbps).\n\nFurthermore this Surround Test DVD can be used to test your A/V-Receiver (5.1DD/DTS decoder) capabilities because it includes LPCM tracks as reference.\n\nAlso you can just enjoy the surround because it is 100% mixed in real discreet surround.\nA very fine DVD to demo your high-end A/V-Receiver ;)\n\n\n\nDVD Info (Audio Only) :\nSource : Ambra - Prism of Life - DVD9\nVideo : NTSC 16/9 (150kbps, still pictures)\nAudio : 2x LPCM (1536kbps), DTS (1536kbps), 2x DTS (768kbps), 2x 5.1DD (448kbps) en 2.0DD (192kbps) \nTracks : 15 tracks\nMenu : Yes, Main and Settings (8x Audio selection)\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Info Tracks 1 to 8 :\n\nTrack 1 :\nOriginal 5.1 DTS track from the Ambra DVD in full bitrate (1536kbps).\n\nTrack 2 :\nConverted DTS (768kbps) - DTS HD Encoder.\n\nTrack 3 :\nConverted 5.1DD (448kbps) - Aften 4.1 Encoder.\n\n\n\n\nTrack 4 :\nOriginal LPCM (stereo) track from the Ambra DVD\n\nTrack 5 :\nLPCM from 5.0 DD (448kbps) Aften 4.1 Encoder (stereo only)\n\nTrack 6 :\n5.0 DD (448kbps) Aften 4.1 Encoder (stereo only)\n\nTrack 7 :\n5.0 DTS (768kbps) (stereo only)\n\nTrack 8 :\n2.0 DD (192kbps)\n\n\nNote : For the necessary decoding of the DTS and 5.1DD (AC3) Foobar2000 is being used.\n\n\n\n\nTesting Surround 5.1DD&amp;DTS :\nThe surround tracks 2 to 3 are both converted using the same source (track 1).\nThey should sound (almost) equally.\nThe reference DTS (track 1) might sound slightly clearer, however this is according to me marginal.\n\nIf clear differences are heart between DTS and 5.1DD continue comparing Track 4 to 7.\n\n\nChecking the stereo tracks :\nThe reason for checking in stereo is to exclude faults from DTS or AC3 decoders.\nLPCM is a very old and simple codec which will in all cases be converted perfectly by any A/V-Receiver and therefore be seen as a reference.\n\nCompare Track 4 with 5 and you will notice that there is almost no differences.\nAny differences heart is caused by the codec Dolby Digital and its compression.\n\nCompare Track 4 with 6.\nIf you hear more differences between 4 and 6 (compared to 4 and 5) this is caused by the Dolby Digital decoder of your A/V-Receiver.\n\nCompare Track 4 with 7 to see if your DTS decodes perfectly.\nIt should sound almost identical to the LPCM track.\n\nPlease note that the stereo tracks (DTS/DD) are in fact encoded in 5.0 surround mode and only L and R are modulated.\nI did not included a LPCM track converted back from the DTS track.\nThe differences would (theoretically) be less than the LPCM conversion of the 5.1DD track.\n\n\n\nCallibration :\nThe DVD can also be used to callibrate your receiver levels for different modes.\nTrack 4, 6, 7 and 8 are Resp. LPCM, Surround DD, DTS and Stereo DD.\nThese tracks have all the same modulation (within 0.1dB).\nModern A/V-Receivers have the abbility to adjust levels for these different modes.\nUse the LPCM as reference and adjust the others to the same level. \n\nPlease take care that 2.0DD is callibrated in stereo and not in Dolby Prologic.\n\nBefore callibrating the different modes it is neccesary to callibrate the levels of all your speakers.\nMost modern A/V-Receivers have internal test tones (noise) which can be used to callibrate the 5 (or more) channels to the same level.\n\n\n\nI hope you will all ENJOY this &quot;Ultimate 5.1DD/DTS Surround Test-DVD - (R.K. Edition)&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88e0cc50f02ad79df39188a55824ef6c55ebe7ee","amp;dn":"The+Ultimate+5.1DD%2FDTS+Surround+Test-DVD+-+%28R.K.+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88e0cc50f02ad79df39188a55824ef6c55ebe7ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,224,204,80,240,42,215,157,243,145,136,165,88,36,239,108,85,235,231,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
