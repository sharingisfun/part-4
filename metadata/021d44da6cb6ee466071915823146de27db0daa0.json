Science tells us people with power feel less compassion for the suffering of others. \n\nPrevious experiments also show us that those who are obedient to authority are capable of the worst forms of murder, and tolerant of the worst forms of abuse. They will even chastise those of us who resist corrupt authority. They become facilitators of evil, believing that obedience to authority absolves them of personal responsibility. \n\nThis is the fifth draft of a renegade psychological experiment on authoritarian sociopathy, specifically on police brutality. We aim to show the world beyond a shadow of a doubt, that power corrupts absolutely, and corrupt authority deserves no obedience.\n\nIf you like this audiobook, consider sending some BTC to 1BnAeWodsXMG4U2r9P6cHXD9DDfvJLZLvF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:021d44da6cb6ee466071915823146de27db0daa0","amp;dn":"Authoritarian+Sociopathy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"021d44da6cb6ee466071915823146de27db0daa0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,29,68,218,108,182,238,70,96,113,145,88,35,20,109,226,125,176,218,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
