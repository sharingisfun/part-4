The members of    \n    the group, Luke Boerdam (Vocals, Guitars), James Tidswell      \n    (Guitars), Luke Henery (Bass) and Michael Richards (Drums).    \n    Violent Soho began playing music together in their teens, who  \n    embraced an 80's and 90's punk-grunge impact to their music    \n    without disregarding the ethic that ideally follows from such  \n    influence. The band has since then gone on its way to          \n    creating an energetic live show. From its beginnings, playing  \n    shows at outer-suburban pubs and rehearsing and recording      \n    demos in their parents' garages. Violent Soho has toured       \n    extensively across the globe as well as played shows with      \n    such bands as Dinosaur Jr, Built to Spill, Trail of Dead, The  \n    Black Keys, The Bronx, Black Francis, Dead Weather, The        \n    Grates, Grinspoon, Cosmic Psychos, Celibate Rifles, Hard-Ons,  \n    and others. They've played many festivals around Australia     \n    including Homebake, Meredith, Falls Festival, Laneway          \n    Festival and featured on this year's line-up for Download      \n    festival in the UK. The band signed an overwhelmingly          \n    exciting deal with Ecstatic Peace/Universal Motown US - a      \n    totally ace label headed up by none other than Sonic Youth's   \n    Thurston Moore (obviously a major hero to VS as the front man  \n    to one of the greatest bands ever). This of course is pretty   \n    much the band's biggest dream come true, so obviously they     \n    are over the moon at the opportunity to be backed by such a    \n    man &amp; the prospect of spending a lot of 2009 in the USA        \n    releasing their debut album in March 2010 and touring.         \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c3b82fe7f1d0ef20ab461c02dc4f60891e0f6fb","amp;dn":"Violent+Soho+-+Violent+Soho+%5B2010%5D+-+GovoGrave","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c3b82fe7f1d0ef20ab461c02dc4f60891e0f6fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,59,130,254,127,29,14,242,10,180,97,192,45,196,246,8,145,224,246,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
