Written by the developers of C, this new version helps readers keep up with the finalized ANSI standard for C while showing how to take advantage of C's rich set of operators, economy of expression, improved control flow, and data structures. The 2/E has been completely rewritten with additional examples and problem sets to clarify the implementation of difficult language constructs. For years, C programmers have let K&amp;R guide them to building well-structured and efficient programs. Now this same help is available to those working with ANSI compilers. Includes detailed coverage of the C language plus the official C language reference manual for at-a-glance help with syntax notation, declarations, ANSI changes, scope rules, and the list goes on and on.\n\n\n\n-----\n\nContains bookmarks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8bf459af513b45cc58f23e17f59d56357e4979e","amp;dn":"The+C+Programming+Language%2C+2nd+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8bf459af513b45cc58f23e17f59d56357e4979e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,191,69,154,245,19,180,92,197,143,35,225,127,89,213,99,87,228,151,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
