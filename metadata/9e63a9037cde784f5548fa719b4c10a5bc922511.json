It allows the reader to engage with the immediate development of the power system and to take part in the debate over the future Smart Grid. The book opens with an overview on understanding the Smart Grid, and then is divided into three sections. Section 1 ('Information and Communications Technologies') covers communication standards for the Smart Grid. Section Two discusses sensing, measurement, control and automation.Smart metering and demand side participation are described in detail, before distribution automation and the distribution management system. The last chapter of this section covers advanced transmission system operation. Section Three looks at power electronic and advanced components. First of all the topic of power electronics in power demand and supply is presented. Enabling technologies and advanced components are described last of all, giving a balanced view of Smart Grids.\n\n\nHardcover: 310 pages\nPublisher: Wiley; 1 edition (April 17, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0470974095\nISBN-13: 978-0470974094","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e63a9037cde784f5548fa719b4c10a5bc922511","amp;dn":"Smart+Grid%3A+Technology+and+Applications+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e63a9037cde784f5548fa719b4c10a5bc922511","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,99,169,3,124,222,120,79,85,72,250,113,155,76,16,165,188,146,37,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
