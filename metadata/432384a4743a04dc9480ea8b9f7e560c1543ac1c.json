One estimate to the casualties of that disaster put the death number at about 16,000:  8,000 died within the first weeks and another 8,000 have since died from gas-related diseases. A government affidavit filed in the Supreme Court in 2006 stated that of the 558,125 cases of injury resulting from the disaster, 516,406 (92.5%) were minor, 38,478 (6.8%) were temporary partial disablement while 0.7% (~3,900) were severely and permanently disabled.\n\n\nThere are 52 titles in this UL distributed over the main directory and 2 subdirectories.
