This medium, more than any other, goes its own way - it drips, forms puddles, is vulnerable to temperature and air and, most especially, to every nuance of the touch of the brush. It reflects each mark and every stroke leaves its impression. Because of these properties, Draughon, like many artists before her, feels a deep passion for watercolour. This volume argues that strong feelings and emotions make for strong and powerful art. She shows readers how to scratch the surface of their subconscious in order to generate more meaningful work. Draughon's approach is to guide readers in exploring their own feelings and emotions towards key subject areas, such as childhood memories, religious imagery, our inner selves as revealed in animals and plants, self-portraiture, and real and imagined landscapes. Each painting is viewed from the inside - from the preconscious with inner life as the model - and from the outside - with nature as a model","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c521632a689cf4f31a0d750233036f86f3ba32e2","amp;dn":"A+Passion+for+Watercolor+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c521632a689cf4f31a0d750233036f86f3ba32e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,33,99,42,104,156,244,243,26,13,117,2,51,3,111,134,243,186,50,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
