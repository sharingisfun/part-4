Now a mere cleaning man at the Bolshoi, he learns by accident that the ChÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢telet Theater in Paris invites the Bolshoi orchestra to play there. He decides to gather together his former musicians and to perform in Paris in the place of the current Bolshoi orchestra. As a solo violin player to accompany his old Jewish or Gypsy musicians he wants Anne-Marie Jacquet, a young virtuoso. If they all overcome the hardships ahead this very special concert will be a triumph. (IMDB)\n\n\nTHIS TORRENT IS THE &quot;ORIGINAL VERSION&quot;, SPOKEN IN FRENCH AND RUSSIAN.
