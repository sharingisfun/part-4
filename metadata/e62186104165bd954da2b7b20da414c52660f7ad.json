His contribution to poetry began with his development of Imagism, a movement derived from classical Chinese and Japanese poetry, stressing clarity, precision and economy of language.\n\nIn 1924, he moved to Italy; during this period of voluntary exile, Pound became involved in Fascist politics, broadcasting radio propaganda that criticized the U.S., Roosevelt, and Jews. As a result, he was arrested by American forces in Italy in 1945 on charges of treason and subsequently incarcerated in a psychiatric hospital for over 12 years. After continuous appeals from writers won his release from the hospital in 1958, Pound returned to Italy where he died, a semi-recluse, in 1972.\n\nHis best-known poetical works include RIPOSTES (1912); HUGH SELWYN MAUBERLEY (1920); PERSONAE, a selection of poems Pound wished to keep in print; and THE CANTOS (1917-69), an unfinished encyclopedic epic. Among his most famous prose works are THE SPIRIT OF ROMANCE (1910); LITERARY ESSAYS (1954), the bulk of his best criticism, edited with an introduction by T. S. Eliot; and GUIDE TO KULCHUR (1938). Pound's SELECTED LETTERS (1971) offers an excellent introduction to his literary life and inimitable epistolary style.\n\nPound's political views and antisemitism ensure that his work remains as controversial now as it was during his lifetime. In 1933 Time magazine called him &quot;a cat that walks by himself, tenaciously unhousebroken and very unsafe for children.&quot; On the other hand, Ernest Hemingway declared that &quot;the best of Pound's writing, and it is in the CANTOS, will last as long as there is any literature.&quot; \n\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise indicated:\n\n\n                                 == POETRY ==\n\n* A Lume Spento &amp; Other Early Poems (New Directions, 1965)\n\n* Cantos, The (Faber &amp; Faber, 1975)\n\n* Canzoni (Elkin Mathews, 1911)\n\n* Diptych Rome-London: &quot;Homage to Sextus Propertius&quot; and &quot;Hugh Selwyn Mauberley&quot; (New Directions, 1994) -- ePUB\n\n* Early Poetical Works (Delphi Classics, 2015) -- ePUB\n\n* Exultations (Elkin Mathews, 1909)\n\n* Lustra and Other Poems (Knopf, 1917)\n\n* Personae (Elkin Mathews, 1909)\n\n* Personae: The Shorter Poems (New Directions, 1990).
