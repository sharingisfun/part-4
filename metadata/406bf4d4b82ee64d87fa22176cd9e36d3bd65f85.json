Following a question-answer approach to developing the narrative, and including self-assessment MCQs, EMQs and SAQs, the book includes 27 fully-illustrated cases covering a wide range of neurological presentations and conditions.\n\nIdeal for medical students with clinical attachments in neurology, and in the run up to examinations, the book will also be useful to doctors in training in general internal medicine, medicine of the elderly, psychiatry and neurology.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:406bf4d4b82ee64d87fa22176cd9e36d3bd65f85","amp;dn":"Neurology%2C+Clinical+Cases+Uncovered+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"406bf4d4b82ee64d87fa22176cd9e36d3bd65f85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,107,244,212,184,46,230,77,135,250,34,23,108,217,227,109,59,214,95,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
