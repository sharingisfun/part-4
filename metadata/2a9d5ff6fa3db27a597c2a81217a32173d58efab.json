But what are thoughts? How does the brain--billions of tiny neurons and synapses--accomplish thought? \n\n In this compelling Very Short Introduction, Tim Bayne offers a compact but wide-ranging account of the nature of thought, drawing upon philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and anthropology. Bayne touches on a stimulating array of topics. Does thinking occur in public or is it a purely private affair? Do young children and non-human animals think? Is human thought the same everywhere, or are there culturally specific modes of thought? What is the relationship between thought and language? What kind of responsibility do we have for our thoughts? In what ways can the process of thinking go wrong? Beginning with questions about what thought is and what distinguishes it from other kinds of mental states, he explores the logical structures of thought as well as the mechanisms that make thought possible. In sum, this book provides an engaging survey of what we know--and what we don't know--about one of the most central of human capacities.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a9d5ff6fa3db27a597c2a81217a32173d58efab","amp;dn":"Thought%3A+A+Very+Short+Introduction+%282013%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a9d5ff6fa3db27a597c2a81217a32173d58efab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,157,95,246,250,61,178,122,89,124,42,129,33,122,50,23,61,88,239,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
