The muckrakers are portrayed through the greatest group of journalists ever assembled at one magazineÃ¢â‚¬â€Ida Tarbell, Ray Stannard Baker, Lincoln Steffens, and William Allen WhiteÃ¢â‚¬â€teamed under the mercurial genius of publisher S. S. McClure.\n\nGoodwinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s narrative is founded upon a wealth of primary materials. The correspondence of more than four hundred letters between Roosevelt and Taft begins in their early thirties and ends only months before RooseveltÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death. Edith Roosevelt and Nellie Taft kept diaries. The muckrakers wrote hundreds of letters to one another, kept journals, and wrote their memoirs. The letters of Captain Archie Butt, who served as a personal aide to both Roosevelt and Taft, provide an intimate view of both men.\n\nThe Bully Pulpit, like GoodwinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brilliant chronicles of the Civil War and World War II, exquisitely demonstrates her distinctive ability to combine scholarly rigor with accessibility. It is a major work of historyÃ¢â‚¬â€an examination of leadership in a rare moment of activism and reform that brought the country closer to its founding ideals.\n\nAn Amazon Best Book of the Month, November 2013: In an era when cooperation between the national media and the US government seems laughable, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Doris Kearns GoodwinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s timely 100-year look backward explores the origins of the type of muckraking journalism that helped make America a better country. Focusing on the presidencies of Theodore Roosevelt and his successor, William Howard Taft--one-time colleagues and friends who later became sworn foes--Goodwin chronicles the birth of an activist press, which occurred when five of the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best-ever journalists converged at McClureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s magazine and helped usher in the Progressive era. At times slow and overly meticulous, with a lot of backstory and historical minutiae, this is nonetheless a lush, lively, and surprisingly urgent story--a series of entwined stories, actually, with headstrong and irascible characters who had me pining for journalismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earlier days. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a big book that cries out for a weekend in a cabin, a book to get fully lost in, to hole up with and ignore the modern world, to experience the days when newsmen and women were our heroes. --Neal Thompson","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f71fecb32a08c879c9b251771e29ccd6c47dfc8","amp;dn":"Doris+Kearns+Goodwin+-+The+Bully+Pulpit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f71fecb32a08c879c9b251771e29ccd6c47dfc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,113,254,203,50,160,140,135,156,155,37,23,113,226,156,205,108,71,223,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
