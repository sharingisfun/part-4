If you understand the math but don't do well in word problems then you will have trouble. And if you understand the word problem but have no idea where to begin with the math, again, you will not do well.\r\n\r\nThe Ultimate Physics 2 Tutor, Volume is a focuses on Thermodynamics and begins at the very beginning assuming the student has never been exposed to this material. The course then proceeds to introduce new topics in an easy-to-understand fashion. \r\n\r\nThe course is a 3 DVD series, 10 full hours in duration, and contains 11 chapters of material so you can be assured that all of the core topics are covered in detail. What sets this DVD apart from the rest is that the concepts are taught entirely through example problems. The easiest way to learn Physics is to work problems as you learn the material - and that is exactly what this 2 DVD series provides. You will immediately improve your problem-solving skills which will help on homework and exams, and you will have a reference for many of the commonly asked problems in Physics. If you have a problem with your homework, simply find a similar problem fully worked on the Ultimate Physics Tutor!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTopics Covered;\r\n\r\nSection 1: Thermometers and Temperature Scales\r\nSection 2: Expansion and Contraction of Materials [View Sample Lesson]\r\nSection 3: Kinetic Theory of Gases\r\nSection 4: Heat [View Sample Lesson]\r\nSection 5: Latent Heat and Phase Change\r\nSection 6: Heat Transfer by Convection, Radiation, and Conduction\r\nSection 7: Work, Heat, and PV Diagrams\r\nSection 8: The First Law of Thermodynamics [View Sample Lesson]\r\nSection 9: Heat Engines and the Second Law of Thermodynamics\r\nSection 10: Refrigerators\r\nSection 11: Entropy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d1dee21a162e6cfd5e4cd70c68578cf7803fd42","amp;dn":"Ultimate+Physics+Tutor+Course+2.1+-+Thermodynamics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d1dee21a162e6cfd5e4cd70c68578cf7803fd42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,29,238,33,161,98,230,207,213,228,205,112,198,133,120,207,120,3,253,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
