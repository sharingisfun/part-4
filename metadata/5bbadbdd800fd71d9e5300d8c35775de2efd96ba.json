Today, the group's sales exceed 80 million records, a figure that places Foreigner among the best-selling bands of all time. Their classic songs continue to resonate with fans in the modern era, having just recently received RIAA gold and platinum awards for digital sales on six of their iconic rock anthems.\n\nRhino celebrates the band's prolific tenure with Atlantic Records with a seven-disc collection that brings together Foreigner's first seven studio albums, as well as a number of bonus tracks.\n\nPresented in a clamshell box, the collection retraces the group's history at Atlantic Records between 1977 and 1991 and features 80 tracks, including nine Top 10 hits. The set includes: Foreigner (1977), Double Vision (1978), Head Games (1979), 4 (1981), Agent Provocateur (1984), Inside Information (1987) and Unusual Heat (1991).\n\nThe remarkable number of instantly recognizable Top 40 hits included in this set is truly impressive and a reminder of why Foreigner has sold so many records: &quot;Feels Like the First Time&quot; and &quot;Cold As Ice&quot; from the band s 5x-platinum self-titled debut; &quot;Hot Blooded&quot; from the 6x-platinum Double Vision; &quot;Dirty White Boy&quot; from the 5x-platinum Head Games; &quot;Waiting For A Girl Like You&quot; and &quot;Urgent&quot; from the 6x-platinum 4; &quot;I Want To Know What Love Is&quot; from the 3x-platinum Agent Provocateur; and &quot;Say You Will&quot; and &quot;I Don t Want To Live Without You&quot; from the platinum Inside Information.\n\nBeyond the studio albums, The Complete Atlantic Studio Albums 1977-1991 also features every bonus track from the 2002 deluxe editions of the band s first four albums. Among the many standouts are the demo of &quot;Feels Like The First Time,&quot; a live version of &quot;Hot Blooded,&quot; and a &quot;nearly unplugged&quot; version of &quot;Waiting For A Girl Like You.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bbadbdd800fd71d9e5300d8c35775de2efd96ba","amp;dn":"Foreigner+-+The+Complete+Atlantic+Studio+Albums+-+7CD-Box+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bbadbdd800fd71d9e5300d8c35775de2efd96ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,186,219,221,128,15,215,29,158,83,0,216,195,87,117,222,46,253,150,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
