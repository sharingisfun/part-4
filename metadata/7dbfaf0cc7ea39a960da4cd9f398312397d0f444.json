This course will help you plan and model your own APIs and understand the six REST design constraints that help guide your architecture. Author Keith Casey starts with a simple overview, including advice on identifying the users or &quot;participants&quot; of your system and the activities they might perform with it. He'll help you paper test your model, validating the design before you build it. You'll then explore the HTTP concepts and REST constraints needed to build your API. Challenges along the way help you test your skills and open your mind to other API design possibilities, such as APIs without documentation.\nTopics include:\n\n    The three approaches to adding an API\n    Modeling tips\n    Creating and grouping API methods\n    Mapping activities to verbs and actions\n    Validating your API\n    Working with HTTP headers and response codes\n    Caching\n    Layered systems\n    Creating a uniform interface\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dbfaf0cc7ea39a960da4cd9f398312397d0f444","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+Effective+Design+of+RESTful+APIs+with+Keith+Casey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dbfaf0cc7ea39a960da4cd9f398312397d0f444","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,191,175,12,199,234,57,169,96,218,76,217,243,152,49,35,151,208,244,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
