This film will concentrate on those eight years of battles, as well \nas his relationship with his boyhood friend and battle mate, Hephaestion. \nAlexander died young, of illness, at 33. Alexander&amp;#039;s conquests paved the way \nfor the spread of Greek culture (facilitating the spread of Christianity \ncenturies later), and removed many of the obstacles that might have prevented \nthe expansion of the Roman Empire. In other words, the world we know today \nmight never have been if not for Alexander&amp;#039;s bloody, yet unifying, conquest. \n\n\nEnjoy....
