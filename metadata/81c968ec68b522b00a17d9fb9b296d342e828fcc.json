Immediately, Fontaine becomes obsessed with the idea of escape. He has nothing to lose. It is only a matter of time before he will be executed by the Nazis. With a spoon, sharpened into an improvised chisel, Fontaine painstakingly dismantles the door to his top floor cell. He then makes a rope from blankets and the wire mesh of his bed. Just as he is about to make his bid for freedom, another prisoner is placed in his cell, a young Frenchman who deserted after joining the German army. Fontaine now faces a terrible dilemma. He must decide whether to take his young cellmate into his confidence or kill him... \n\nFile Name .........................................: A Man Escaped.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,677,557,760 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:36:37\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 704x528 (AR: 1.333)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 2081 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.224 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 224 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049902/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049902/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFrench audio; English, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted at KG by darkkie, whom we thank\n\nRobert Bresson - A Man Escaped (1956)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81c968ec68b522b00a17d9fb9b296d342e828fcc","amp;dn":"Robert+Bresson+-+A+Man+Escaped+%281956%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81c968ec68b522b00a17d9fb9b296d342e828fcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,201,104,236,104,181,34,176,10,23,217,251,155,41,109,52,46,130,143,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
