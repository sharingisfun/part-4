Such a society is characterized by wide spread of: pornography, prostitution, infidelity, sex scandals, sexual liberation, rape and sexual abuse crimes.\n\nThis upload is closely related to the uploads about sexual abuse in Christian homes and churches. The transformation of modern western societies into hypersexual societies may explain the surge of sexual abuse in these societies; but it does not explain the prevalent sexual abuse in the church that has been going on for 2000 years.\nIt is hard to admit; but, the cause of this phenomena has to be rooted in the corrupted content of the Bible that portrays the Prophets of Israel and their immediate families as committing all kinds of sexual crimes and perversions: rape, incest, infidelity, adultery, .. etc.\n\n\n-  America's Top 53 Political Sex Scandals\n\n-  Baker - Sperm Wars; Infidelity, Sexual Conflict and Other Bedroom Battles (1996)\n\n-  Bernstein - Temporarily Yours; Intimacy, Authenticity, and the Commerce of Sex (2007)\n\n-  Brents - The State of Sex; Tourism, Sex, and Sin in the New American Heartland (2010)\n\n-  Brown - Sexual Teens, Sexual Media; Investigating Media's Influence on Adolescent Sexuality (2008)\n\n-  Bruce &amp; Stewart (eds.) - College Sex, Philosophy for Everyone; Philosophers with Benefits (2010)\n\n-  Chiose - Good Girls Do; Sex Chronicles of a Shameless Generation (2001)\n\n-  Earle &amp; Sharp - Sex in Cyberspace; Men Who Pay For Sex (2007)\n\n-  Edwards - Erotics &amp; Politics (1994)\n\n-  Elliott - Sex for America; Politically Inspired Erotica (2008)\n\n-  Florence - Sex at Work; Attraction, Orientation, Harassment, Flirtation and Discrimination (2004)\n\n-  Freitas - Sex and the Soul; Juggling Sexuality, Spirituality, Romance, and Religion on AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s College Campuses (2008)\n\n-  Heap - Slumming; Sexual and Racial Encounters in American Nightlife, 1885ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1940 (2009)\n\n-  Hirshman &amp; Larson - Hard Bargains; The Politics of Sex (1998)\n\n-  Hutton - Risky Pleasures; Club Cultures and Feminine Identities (2006)\n\n-  Jakobsen &amp; Pellegrini - Love the Sin; Sexual Regulation and the Limits of Religious Tolerance (2003)\n\n-  Jenkins - Beyond Tolerance; Child Pornography on the Internet (2001)\n\n-  Jones &amp; Miley - Restless Virgins; Love, Sex, and Survival at a New England Prep School (2007)\n\n-  Kammeyer - A Hypersexual Society; Sexual Discourse, Erotica, and Pornography in America Today (2008)\n\n-  Kroker - Body Invaders, Panic Sex in America (1988)\n\n-  Lawrence - Sexual Liberation; The Scandal Of Christendom (2007)\n\n-  Lubet - Sex, Lies, and Clients; From Bill Clinton to Oscar Wilde (2004)\n\n-  Moulton - Before Pornography; Erotic Writing in Early Modern England (2000)\n\n-  Ost - Child Pornography and Sexual Grooming; Legal and Societal Responses (2009)\n\n-  Pascoe - Dude, YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re a Fag; Masculinity and Sexuality in High School (2007)\n\n-  Peakman - Mighty Lewd Books; The Development of Pornography in 18th Century England (2003)\n\n-  Powell - Sex, Power and Consent; Youth Culture and the Unwritten Rules (2010)\n\n-  Reichert &amp; Lambiase - Sex in Advertising; Perspectives on the Erotic Appeal (2003)\n\n-  Reumann - American Sexual Character; Sex, Gender, and National Identity in the Kinsey Reports (2005)\n\n-  Roach - Stripping, Sex, and Popular Culture (2007)\n\n-  Rumens &amp; Cervantes-Carson (eds.) - Sexual Politics of Desire and Belonging (2007)\n\n-  Starr Report on Clinton-Lewinsky Affair (1998)\n\n-  Struthers - Wired for Intimacy; How Pornography Hijacks the Male Brain (2009)\n\n-  Thorn - Hillary (and Bill); The Sex Volume, Part One of the Clinton Trilogy (2008)\n\n-  Toulalan - Imagining Sex; Pornography and Bodies in Seventeenth-Century England (2007)\n\n-  Ullman - Sex Seen; The Emergence of Modern Sexuality in America (1997)\n\n-  Watson &amp; Martin  - &quot;There She is, Miss America&quot;; The Politics of Sex, Beauty, and Race in America's Most Famous Pageant (2004)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94761a42924e99f8bca39174de28a5b788b780c2","amp;dn":"Criticism+of+the+Western+Civilization+-+Collection+11+%28Hypersexu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94761a42924e99f8bca39174de28a5b788b780c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,118,26,66,146,78,153,248,188,163,145,116,222,40,165,183,136,183,128,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
