It shows that John Coltrane could hold his own with the ballad giants, Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, and Ben Webster.  John is more known for his Ã¢â‚¬Å“sheets of soundÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ playing and his exploratory cutting edge sessions recorded in the mid-60s. With the exception of Love Thy Neighbor, which is taken at a faster, more aggressive pace, the balance of these selections here are taken at a ballad pace.\n\nMatching Stardust, with later Coltrane issues is a nice way to balance both his avant searching qualities with his more romantic side. Add Stardust to your Coltrane collection to get a more complete picture of the genius that is John Coltrane.\n\n\nStraight, no chaser.\n:)\n\n\n  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8c3363595337f47a553a1d6a8c44277d10d172b","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+Stardust+1958+%2F+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8c3363595337f47a553a1d6a8c44277d10d172b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,195,54,53,149,51,127,71,165,83,161,214,168,196,66,119,209,13,23,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
