The book covers the collection, isolation, and culture of diagnostic specimens, with detailed notes on the biochemical, serological and other tests currently used to identify and distinguish between microbial pathogens. The new edition sets out to provide the most up-to-date account of all the clinically and economically important pathogens, including Bovine Spongiform Encephalomyeltis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, E-coli, and Salmonella. The clear, accessible format, together with the complete revision of the content, makes this a valuable resource.\n\nAudience\nAll veterinary medicine students are educated to understand the importance of micro-organisms in the health of the animals they treat. The area of microbiology ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚â€œ including general procedures, bacteriology, mycology and virology are taught, in stages, from the 3rd year onwards. Therefore, although the main market will be both small and large animal clinical practitioners, and specialist microbiologists in particular, the student and library markets are also very important .\n\nNew to This Edition\nGreatly expanded chapter on viruses\nMore on PRIONS (including BSE)\nReclassification of viruses - many changes to nomenclature\nFully revised pathogenicity sections\nRevised/complete coverage of E coli 0157\nRevised Systems section\nComplete update of Infectious Diseases coverage in the appendices\n\nKey Features\nHigh quality full colour photography - Essential for accurate diagnosis\nFully revised pathogenicity sections taking into account the major discoveries/incidences of the last 3-5 years\nReclassification of viruses, including changes to nomenclature\nAppendices of Infectious Diseases - Fast access to vital information\nUnique and practical inclusion of virology, bacteriology and mycology in one text","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95f691ea874197e22f11a45cbed2aa08506cef4f","amp;dn":"Clinical+Veterinary+Microbiology%2C+2+Ed.+%5Btahir99%5D+VRG.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95f691ea874197e22f11a45cbed2aa08506cef4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,246,145,234,135,65,151,226,47,17,164,92,190,210,170,8,80,108,239,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
