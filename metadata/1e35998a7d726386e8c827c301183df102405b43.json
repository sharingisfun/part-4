Interactive\nDeveloper: Monolith Productions\n\nMiddle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is an action-packed adventure-RPG inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Exploring an original story of vengeance and redemption, the game puts players in the role of Talion, a valiant ranger whose family is slain in front of him the night Sauron and his army return to Mordor -- moments before his own life is taken. Resurrected by a Spirit of vengeance and empowered with Wraith abilities, Talion ventures into Mordor and vows to destroy those who have wronged him. Through the course of his personal vendetta, Talion uncovers the truth of the Spirit that compels him, learns the origins of the Rings of Power and ultimately confronts his true nemesis.\n\nEvery enemy that players face is a unique individual, differentiated by their personality, strengths and weaknesses. Through the Nemesis System, enemy relationships and characteristics are shaped by player actions and decisions to create personal archenemies that remember and adapt to the player and are distinct to every gameplay session. Gamers are able to craft their own battles, enemies and rewards within the dynamic world that remembers and adapts to their choices, delivering a unique experience to every player.\n\n\nSize : XXX Gb\nSize After Extraction : 31.4 Gb\nDo not Cut / Recoded \nCrack Used : CODEX\nLanguage:  ENG \nVoice set Language: ENG \n100% Audio\n100% Video\nInstall And Play\n\n\nOS: 64-bit: Vista, Win 7, Win 8\nProcessor: Intel Core i5-750, 2.67 GHz | AMD Phenom II X4 965, 3.4 GHz\nMemory: 3 GB RAM\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460 | AMD Radeon HD 5850\nDirectX: Version 11\nNetwork: Broadband Internet connection\nHard Drive: 40 GB available space\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/1fje94Z.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/1fje94Z.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[b]Seed Atleast 2 Gb To Aid The Files For Future Downloads Also\n\nIf You Like Our Work For You, Appreciate Us By Writing A Comment !![/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e35998a7d726386e8c827c301183df102405b43","amp;dn":"Middle-earth%3A+Shadow+of+Mordor+%7C+PC+Game+2014+%7C+GPR+Repack+%7C+Dow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e35998a7d726386e8c827c301183df102405b43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,53,153,138,125,114,99,134,232,200,39,195,1,24,61,241,2,64,91,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
