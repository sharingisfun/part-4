Organized thematically around important concepts in comparative politics, Who rules? What explains political behavior? Where and why? the book integrates a set of extended case studies in eleven core countries. Serving as consistent geographic touchstones, the cases are set in chapters where they make the most sense substantively not separated from theory or in a separate volume and vividly illustrate issues in cross-national context.\n\nFeatures include several core country case studies: Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, India, Iran, Nigeria, Russia, the UK, the U.S., and, new to this edition, Mexico. The book also features new &quot;Methods in Context&quot; boxes that model how comparativists do their research and analysis, &quot;In Context&quot; fact boxes that put eye-opening data into thematic context, &quot;Where and Why?&quot; boxes that explore why certain political outcomes occur in some countries but not in others, and &quot;Country and Concept&quot; tables that display key indicators for core countries.\n\nUpdates and revisions include: * recent elections around the world and the effects of the global financial crisis and its aftermath, * authoritarian versus totalitarian regimes, * ethnic violence, * racial politics and identity, * economic globalization, * executive-legislative institutions, and * the role of civil society in government.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a2fddad25ebbdfa3068170dc4afd6575d69e8bb","amp;dn":"Introducing+Comparative+Politics%2C+2E+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a2fddad25ebbdfa3068170dc4afd6575d69e8bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,47,221,173,37,235,189,250,48,104,23,13,196,175,214,87,93,105,232,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
