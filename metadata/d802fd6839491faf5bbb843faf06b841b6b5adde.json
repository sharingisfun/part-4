Michael Wood heads to the city of Kaifeng, the greatest city in the world before the 19th century.\r\nHere in Twin Dragon Alley, locals tell him the legend of the baby boys who became emperors. He explores the ideas and inventions that made the Song one of greatest eras in world culture, helped by China's most famous work of art, the Kaifeng scroll, which shows the life of the city in around 1120. A chef makes Michael a recipe from a Song cookbook, while a guide to 'how to live happy, healthy lives for old people', published in 1085 and still in print, is discussed with local women doing their morning exercises. The Song was also a great era for scientific advance in China. Michael steers a huge working replica of an astronomical clock, made by China's Leonardo da Vinci. Then at a crunch Chinese Premier League match, Michael tells us the Chinese invented football!\r\nThe golden age of the northern Song ended in 1127, when invaders sacked Kaifeng, but they survived in the south. At their new capital, Hangzhou, Wood joins locals dancing by the West Lake, while in the countryside he meets Mr Xie with his records of 40 generations of ancestors.\r\nThe final defeat of the Song took place in a naval battle in the estuary of the Pearl River in 1279. When all was lost, rather than surrender to the Mongols, a loyal minister jumped into the sea with the young boy emperor in his arms. 'So ended the glory of the Song', Wood concludes, 'but a new age would arise... as in China, it always has!'\r\n\r\n                  This is Part 3 of a 6 Part series\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/61/The-Golden-Age-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/92/The-Golden-Age-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d0/The-Golden-Age-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/49/The-Golden-Age-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a6/The-Golden-Age-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/97/The-Golden-Age-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/99/The-Golden-Age-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e1/The-Golden-Age-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5e/The-Golden-Age-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1f/The-Golden-Age-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f8/The-Golden-Age-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e4/The-Golden-Age-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7b/The-Golden-Age-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1e/The-Golden-Age-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0f/The-Golden-Age-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d1/The-Golden-Age-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3010 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.30 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06zyd53\r\n\r\n2)  Related Documentaries \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Ancestors \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Silk%20Roads%20and%20China%20Ships","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d802fd6839491faf5bbb843faf06b841b6b5adde","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Story+of+China+The+Golden+Age+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d802fd6839491faf5bbb843faf06b841b6b5adde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,2,253,104,57,73,31,175,91,187,132,63,175,6,184,65,182,181,173,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
