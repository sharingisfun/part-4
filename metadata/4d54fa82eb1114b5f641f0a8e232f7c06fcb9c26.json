It is an easily read and absorbing overview of the history of mathematics with suggestions for its use in the classroom. The history of each major branch of mathematics (Number, Computation, Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry and Calculus) is individually summarized and followed by brief essays on specific topics of significance within each branch. This organization makes it easy to find and quickly read the informative articles on any chosen topic. The writing style and reading levels of most articles also make them available to high school students. \r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nPREFACE ix\r\nI THE HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS AS A TEACHING TOOL\r\nPhillip S.
