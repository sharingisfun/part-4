This second edition enhances that learning experience.\r\n\r\nHere you will find unique, photographically precise diagrams of breadboarded components, to help you build circuits with speed and precision. A new shopping guide and a simplified range of components, will minimize your investment in parts for the projects. A completely new section on the Arduino shows you how to write properly structured programs instead of just downloading other people's code. Projects have been reworked to provide additional features, and the book has been restructured to offer a step-by-step learning process that is as clear and visually pleasing on handheld devices as it is on paper. Full color is used throughout.\r\n\r\nAs before, Make: Electronics begins with the basics. You'll see for yourself how components work--and what happens when they don't. You'll short out a battery and overheat an LED. You'll also open up a potentiometer and a relay to see what's inside. No other book gives you such an opportunity to learn from real-life experiences.\r\n\r\nUltimately, you will build gadgets that have lasting value, and you'll have a complete understanding of how they work. From capacitors to transistors to microcontrollers--it's all here.\r\n\r\nHans Camenzind, inventor of the 555 Timer (the world's most successful integrated circuit chip), said that &quot;This is teaching at its best!&quot; when he reviewed the first edition. Now the second edition offers even more!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d76664486516fa902ae037c055977c3912056ff0","amp;dn":"Make+Electronics+-+2nd+Ed+%282015%29+%28Pdf+and+Epub%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d76664486516fa902ae037c055977c3912056ff0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,102,100,72,101,22,250,144,42,224,55,192,85,151,124,57,18,5,111,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
