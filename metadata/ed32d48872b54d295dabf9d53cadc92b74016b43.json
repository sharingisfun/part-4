His influence cannot be underestimated. Over 125 years after his mahasamadhi, his organization is still going strong. But the real influence is in the ideas that, through Vivekananda, went out to the world.\n\n\nThis includes some really great works -- notably &quot;Ramakrishna The Great Master&quot;, the complete Kathamritam by Mahendranath Gupta, and the abridged version titled &quot;The Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot;.\n\nAdvaita Ashrama and the Vedanta Society (the main organization promulgating these teachings)have, sadly, withdrawn many of these books and are now looking to iTunes and an App to allow the purchase of their books. They are quite expensive. It really saddens me to see spiritual books being used as a revenue stream. I hope someone will get all the books that are available and put them on the net.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed32d48872b54d295dabf9d53cadc92b74016b43","amp;dn":"Ramakrishna+%2825+books+plus+fotos%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed32d48872b54d295dabf9d53cadc92b74016b43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,50,212,136,114,181,77,41,93,171,249,213,60,173,201,43,116,1,107,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
