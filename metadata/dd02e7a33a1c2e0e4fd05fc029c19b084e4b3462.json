Various acts of self-destruction, multiple band break-ups, and botched record deals have condemned his music to obscurity. Frozen for decades in his parents' basement, Bobby is finally discovered by the heavy metal underground. With the help of Sean 'Pellet' Pelletier, his friend and manager, Bobby struggles to overcome his demons. Directed by Don Argott and Demian Fenton, Last Days Here chronicles the triumphs and downfalls of this underground icon who finds himself at the crossroads of life and death.
