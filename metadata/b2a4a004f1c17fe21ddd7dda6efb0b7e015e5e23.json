They look harmlessâ€”mostly old, lots of polyester, and married to their RVs. But as Dan Torrance knows, and spunky twelve-year-old Abra Stone learns, the True Knot are quasi-immortal, living off the steam that children with the shining produce when they are slowly tortured to death.\r\n\r\nHaunted by the inhabitants of the Overlook Hotel, where he spent one horrific childhood year, Dan has been drifting for decades, desperate to shed his fatherâ€™s legacy of despair, alcoholism, and violence. Finally, he settles in a New Hampshire town, an AA community that sustains him, and a job at a nursing home where his remnant shining power provides the crucial final comfort to the dying. Aided by a prescient cat, he becomes â€œDoctor Sleep.â€\r\n\r\nThen Dan meets the evanescent Abra Stone, and it is her spectacular gift, the brightest shining ever seen, that reignites Danâ€™s own demons and summons him to a battle for Abraâ€™s soul and survival. This is an epic war between good and evil, glorious story that will thrill the millions of devoted readers of The Shining and satisfy anyone new to this icon in the Stephen King canon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2a4a004f1c17fe21ddd7dda6efb0b7e015e5e23","amp;dn":"Stephen+King+-+Doctor+Sleep+%28The+Shining%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2a4a004f1c17fe21ddd7dda6efb0b7e015e5e23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,164,160,4,241,193,127,226,29,221,125,218,110,251,11,126,1,94,94,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
