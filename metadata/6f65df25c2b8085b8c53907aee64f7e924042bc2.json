Often the infamous Illuminati is mentioned as the core of conspiracies which span the globe. The Illuminati is actually a historical secret society which had goals of revolutions and world domination dating back to the 1770s. Since then, rumors and conspiracy theories involving the Illuminati continue to spread, sometimes finding their way into popular novels like Dan Brown's Angels &amp; Demons and Hollywood movies like Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. Some men have even come forward claiming to be former members, offering details of what they allege are the inner workings of the organization. When you sift through all of the information available on the subject, you may be surprised that the truth is stranger than fiction. In The Illuminati: Facts &amp; Fiction, author and occult expert Mark Dice separates history from Hollywood and shows why tales of the secret society won't die. \nGenre: Nonfiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f65df25c2b8085b8c53907aee64f7e924042bc2","amp;dn":"The+Illuminati+Facts+%26amp%3B+Fiction+by+Mark+Dice.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f65df25c2b8085b8c53907aee64f7e924042bc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,101,223,37,194,184,8,91,140,83,144,122,238,100,247,233,36,4,43,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
