McRoberts quot;Arduino Starter Kit (ASK) Manual: A Complete Beginners Guide to the Arduinoquot;\nISBN: 0976782222 | Earthshine Design | March 2010 | 105 pages | File type: PDF | English | 10 mb (book) 16KB (code)\nThis book will guide you, step by step, through using the Starter Kit to learn about the Arduino hardware, software and general electronics theory. Through the use of electronic projects we will take you from the level of complete beginner through to having an intermediate set of skills in using the Arduino.\n\nThe purpose of this book and the kit is to give you a gentle introduction to the Arduino, electronics and programming in C and to set you up with the necessary skills needed to progress beyond the book and the kit into the world of the Arduino and microcontroller electronics.\n\nThe booklet has been written presuming that you have no prior knowledge of electronics, the Arduino hardware, software environment or of computer programming. At no time will we get too deep into electronics or programming in C. There are many other resources available for free that will enable you to learn a lot more\n\nContents:\n\nIntroduction\nThe Starter Kit Contents\nWhat exactly is an Arduino?\nGetting Started\nUpload your first sketch\nThe Arduino IDE\n\nThe Projects:\n\nProject 01 - LED Flasher\nProject 02 - SOS Morse Code Signaller\nProject 03 - Traffic Lights\nProject 04 - Interactive Traffic Lights\nProject 05 - LED Chase Effect\nProject 06 - Interactive LED Chase Effect\nProject 07 - Pulsating Lamp\nProject 08 - Mood Lamp\nProject 09 - LED Fire Effect\nProject 10 - Serial Controlled Mood Lamp\nProject 11 - Drive a DC Motor\nProject 12 - Piezo Sounder Melody Player\nProject 13 - Serial Temperature Sensor\nProject 14 - Light Sensor\nProject 15 - Shift Register 8-Bit Binary Counter\nProject 16 - Dial 8-Bit Binary Counters\nProject 17 - LED Dot Matrix - Basic Animation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb8bd24902319fcc2bde1eade777db6b16f0d296","amp;dn":"Arduino+Starter+Kit+Manual+and+Example+Code","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb8bd24902319fcc2bde1eade777db6b16f0d296","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,139,210,73,2,49,159,204,43,222,30,173,231,119,219,107,22,240,210,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
