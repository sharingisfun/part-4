White, published in a single volume in 1958. The quartet comprises The Sword in the Stone (1938), The Queen of Air and Darkness--first published as The Witch in the Wood (1939)--The Ill-Made Knight (1940), and The Candle in the Wind (published in the composite volume, 1958). The series is a retelling of the Arthurian legend, from Arthur&amp;#039;s birth to the end of his reign, and is based largely on Sir Thomas Malory&amp;#039;s Le Morte Darthur. After White&amp;#039;s death, a conclusion to The Once and Future King was found among his papers; it was published in 1977 as The Book of Merlyn.\n\nYes the book of Merlyn is included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4663a20309b0aa8964c810cd14c1a69839907e73","amp;dn":"T.+H.+White+-+The+Once+and+Future+King+-+All+5+Books+-+Unabridge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4663a20309b0aa8964c810cd14c1a69839907e73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,99,162,3,9,176,170,137,100,200,16,205,20,193,166,152,57,144,126,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
