Everything about these torrents is done for a reason, not without thought.  The RAR file naming convention is purposely to evade DMCA crawlers.\r\n\r\nThese torrents are an expression of appreciation to the NERDs for making all these wonderful ebooks available, providing missing and broken files as needed and giving me their blessing to redistribute them here.\r\n\r\nEither youâ€™re familiar with NERDs ebooks and delighted at the opportunity to back fill your collection, or youâ€™re lucky enough to discover them now while theyâ€™re still available, or you can whine and complain and miss the boat. Your choice.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to everyone for all the nice comments and feedback on earlier torrents and a special thanks to everyone that has contributed their bandwidth and resources to help seed.\r\n\r\nFeel free to express any appreciation to the NERDs for the time and effort it takes to create these wonderful collections, I'm just a messenger.\r\n\r\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52454fb8e94a43460f00bd73f3f64f5ed417c639","amp;dn":"New+ebook+packs+for+January+2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52454fb8e94a43460f00bd73f3f64f5ed417c639","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,69,79,184,233,74,67,70,15,0,189,115,243,246,79,94,212,23,198,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
