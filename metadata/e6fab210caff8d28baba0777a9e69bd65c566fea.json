There have never been more opportunities and possibilities for more people to accomplish more of their goals than exist right now. The level of affluence has never been higher, the average life span has never been longer, the number of options available to you has never been greater and the world situation, in terms of peace and prosperity, has never been more stable.\n\nMeanwhile, the explosion of knowledge and technology in the last few years, combined with the increasing intensity of competition in all fields, has led to an acceleration of the rate of change. More and more, you have too much to do and too little time. Your responsibilities and obligations seem to pile up, one on top of the other. There are never enough hours in the day.\n\nYou may be doing better than you have ever done before. But at the same time, you often feel overwhelmed with the demands of your job and your personal life. You may be working harder today than ever before and yet you are getting less and less satisfaction and enjoyment from what you do. This program gives you the solution to these unavoidable challenges of modern life.\n\nThe Power of Clarity: Find Your Focal Point, Maximize Your Income and Minimize Your Effort is based on more than twenty-five years of personal experience. This first hand knowledge has been combined with extensive research into the habits and behaviors of men and women who accomplish vastly more than the average person in their personal and business lives. It starts with the question, \\\\\\&quot;Why are some people more successful and effective than others?\\\\\\&quot;\n\nThe Power of Clarity answers this question completely. This program explains why and how some people accomplish vastly more in each of the important areas of their lives. It tells you how you too can accomplish more in your work while simultaneously having much more time to spend with your family and on your personal activities.\n\nThe power of Clarity is a synthesis of the best ideas and strategies on personal management ever brought together in one place, in one simple, easy-to-use plan. It shows you to how to organize and simplify your life in the seven critical areas that are essential for complete balance and true peace of mind. You learn how to develop goals and plans in each of the areas that are important to you. You learn how to set clear priorities among the competing demands on your time. You learn how to focus single mindedly on the one thing that you can do at any given time to achieve the most important results possible for you in that area. You learn how to make the best use of the time in your life, minute-by-minute and hour-by-hour.\n\nThis program answers some of the key questions that you probably ask yourself on a regular basis, \\\\\\&quot;How can I get control of my time and my life? How can I achieve maximum success in my career and still achieve balance in my relationships and my personal life? How can I have it all and still be happy and fulfilled?\\\\\\&quot;\n\nThe central concept of this program is the principle of clarity. In this program, you will learn how to develop absolute clarity regarding who you are and what you really want. You will learn how to achieve your most important goals faster and easier than you can imagine today. You will learn how to tap into and use your personal powers at a higher level than you ever have before.\n\nIn The Power of Clarity, youÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™?ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ll learn to:\n\n- get control of your time and your life\n- double your time off, with no loss of productivity\n- form good habits and make them your masters\n- double your income\n- focus your energy and attention on valuable tasks\n- reduce the number of hours you need to work each week\n- dramatically improve the quality of your relationships\n\nBrian Tracy will teach you how to think the way the most effective people think, and to then take the actions that the most effective people take.
