Giving yearly seminars in Paris from 1953 to 1981, the charismatic Lacan influenced many leading French intellectuals in the 1960s and the 1970s, especially those associated with poststructuralism.  His ideas -- about otherness, subjectivity, sexual difference, the drives, the law, and enjoyment -- had a significant impact on critical theory, literary theory, 20th-century French philosophy, sociology, feminist theory, film theory and clinical psychoanalysis.  Lacan's writing is notoriously difficult, due in part to the repeated Hegelian/KojÃƒÂ¨vean allusions, wide theoretical divergences from other psychoanalytic and philosophical theory, and an obscure prose style.\n\nLacan achieved international attention in 1966 with the publication of Ãƒâ€°CRITS, a compilation of his psychoanalytic writings spanning some thirty years of his career.  Ãƒâ€°CRITS was included on the list of 100 most influential books of the 20th century compiled and polled by the broadsheet Le Monde.  A selection of the writings were translated by Alan Sheridan in 1977 and again by Bruce Fink in 2004.  The full text appeared for the first time in English in Bruce Fink's 2006 translation.\n\nJacques-Alain Miller is the sole editor of Lacan's SEMINARS, which contain the majority of his life's work.  There has been considerable controversy over the accuracy or otherwise of the transcription and editing, as well as over Miller's refusal to allow any critical or annotated edition to be published.  Despite Lacan's status as a major figure in the history of psychoanalysis, some of his seminars remain unpublished.\n\n\nThe following books (and nine unlisted articles) are in PDF format unless otherwise noted:\n\n* Ãƒâ€°CRITS: The First Complete Edition in English (Norton, 2005).
