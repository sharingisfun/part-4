The band is currently based in Toronto, Ontario.\n\nThe band started their career with the name One I'd Trouser, a line taken from a song in Monty Pythons' &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;, when they formed while in high school in Antigonish Nova Scotia, before changing their name to Trouser, and eventually The Trews. They released an EP as One I'd Trouser, and a second EP under the name The Trews.\n\nIn the early summer of 2002 the band entered Rock Search, a high profile contest that is held annually by CHTZ-FM, a St. Catharines (Southern Ontario) rock radio station. Winning the contest would prove to be their big break as they soon landed a recording contract with Bumstead Productions Ltd.\n\nThe release of their first full-length CD House of Ill Fame, soon followed in 2003. Produced by Big Sugar's Gordie Johnson, the album contained the singles &quot;Every Inambition&quot;, &quot;Not Ready to Go&quot;, &quot;Tired of Waiting&quot;, &quot;Fleeting Trust&quot; and &quot;Confessions&quot;. &quot;Not Ready to Go&quot; hit number one on Canadian rock radio and was the most played song of 2004 in that format. The band was nominated as New Group of the Year at the 2004 Juno Awards (Canadian Grammys) and &quot;Not Ready to Go&quot; was nominated as Single of the Year in 2005.[1] House Of Ill Fame has been certified gold in Canada. It was re-released with a bonus live album called &quot;the Live Cut&quot; which featured live versions of songs taken from the album.\n\nThe song &quot;Hollis and Morris&quot; on their first album, refers to an intersection in the nearby city of Halifax, and not an intersection in Antigonish as previously speculated. The band has mentioned during concerts and in interviews that the corner of Hollis and Morris is notorious for prostitution.[2]\n\nThe band released a follow-up to House of Ill Fame on August 16, 2005. The album, Den of Thieves, was produced by legendary producer Jack Douglas (Aerosmith, Cheap Trick, John Lennon, New York Dolls). The first single, &quot;So She's Leaving&quot;, was released to radio June 28, 2005 and was followed by the singles &quot;Yearning&quot;, which was their second single to reach number 1, &quot;Poor Ol' Broken Hearted Me&quot;, and &quot;I Can't Say&quot;. In the summer of 2005 the band was invited to share the stage with the Rolling Stones at the Phoenix Concert Theater in Toronto as part of the Stones' Bigger Bang Tour. In fall of the same year they were invited to open for Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant on his across Canada arena tour. Den of Thieves was certified Canadian Gold in April 2006. The album was released April 18, 2006 in the United States on Red Ink and Sony BMG.\n\nThe Trews' third album, No Time for Later, was released in February, 2008. The first single, &quot;Hold Me in Your Arms&quot;, was made available on November 25, 2007. It premiered at the 2007 Grey Cup pre-game show and was immediately released on iTunes; the video for the song eventually went to number one on MuchMusic for a week in April 2008. In early 2009, &quot;Hold Me in Your Arms&quot; won in The 8th Annual Independent Music Awards(US) for Best Hard Rock/Metal Song.[3] A bonus song called &quot;Long Way from Freedom&quot; was included with the single but was not released on the album. &quot;Hold Me in Your Arms&quot; went on to spend 22 weeks in the top ten at rock radio in Canada and in May 2010 was certified Canadian gold the commemorate the sales of over 20,000 digital downloads. In early February 2008, the band added keyboardist Jeff Heisholt to their live line up. The second single from No Time for Later was &quot;Paranoid Freak&quot;, the video for which was released in May and went straight into rotation on MuchMusic. The third single, a ballad called &quot;Man Of Two Minds&quot;, was released September 8, 2008 and the video reached number one on MuchMusic sister station MuchMoreMusic. The fourth single, &quot;Can't Stop Laughing&quot;, was sent to radio in January 2009 with a video that followed in April and became the bands tenth single to enter the top ten at Canadian rock radio. The band was nominated for two Juno Awards in 2009, Album of the Year (for No Time for Later) and Group of the Year.\n\nNo Time for Later was released in the United States on April 7, 2009, on Merovingian Music. The first single &quot;Paranoid Freak&quot; was sent to radio a few weeks prior to its release and was added in heavy rotation at Sirius Satellite Radio's Alt. Nation. The second single in the US was &quot;Hold Me In Your Arms&quot; and garnered significant play at Active Rock.\n\nTheir second live album, Acoustic - Friends &amp; Total Strangers, released Oct. 6, 2009, was an acoustic session recorded over two nights at Toronto's Glenn Gould Studio in January 2009 for a live audience. It was released without any edits or overdubs and was produced by the bands guitarist John Angus MacDonald. There is also a 23-song DVD of the same name available which captures the second nights performance in its entirety as well as candid interviews with the band. The release earned the band their fifth Juno nomination for DVD of the year in 2010. The albums only single, &quot;Sing Your Heart Out&quot;, a new song written specifically for the performances, won Best AAA/Alternative Song at the 2010 International Acoustic Music Awards (US).\n\nFollowing Acoustic - Friends &amp; Total Strangers the band released the single &quot;Highway Of Heroes&quot;. It was inspired by the 2006 death of Capt. Nichola Goddard, the first Canadian female soldier killed in Afghanistan and a schoolmate of members of the Trews. It refers to the stretch of Highway 401 in Ontario, between CFB Trenton and downtown Toronto, where hundreds gather on bridges and overpasses to mourn soldiers killed in Afghanistan while the bodies of the fallen soldiers are transported from Trenton to the coroner's office in downtown Toronto. The song was made available on iTunes in Canada only, with all proceeds from the sales of the song going to the Canadian Hero Fund, a charity that provides academic scholarships to the spouses and children of soldiers killed in combat.[4]\n\nIn November 2010 the band performed the Canadian National anthem at the 98th Grey Cup in Edmonton.\n\nThe band's fourth studio album, Hope &amp; Ruin was released on April 12, 2011. The album was co-produced by John-Angus MacDonald and the Tragically Hip's Gord Sinclair and was recorded at the Hip's own Bathouse Studio in Bath, Ontario. The album was mixed by Canadian engineer/mixer Mike Fraser (AC/DC, Franz Ferdinand, Aerosmith, Mother Mother). The first single &quot;Hope and Ruin&quot; entered the top ten at Canadian rock radio within 3 weeks of its release. The video for Hope and Ruin received significant play on MuchMoreMusic.

The group rehearsed for several months and narrowed a group of over 30 songs to the thirteen that made the final album.[2] A song called &quot;Long Way from Freedom&quot; was also recorded for the album, but was not included. It was later added to The Trews' website as a free download.[3] The album was recorded in mid-2007 in Toronto and Brooklyn.[1]\n\nSinger Simon Wilcox helped write the title track. According to John-Angus MacDonald, the title came from a discussion between Wilcox and lead singer Colin MacDonald. Colin said &quot;there's no time for later, we'll finish the song&quot; and Wilcox, not realizing that Colin wasn't referring to a song, responded with &quot;No, let's work on that song.&quot; Following the discussion, MacDonald quickly wrote a verse and chorus in about five minutes.[2]\n\nThe song &quot;Gun Control&quot; was written following the Virginia Tech massacre on April 16, 2007. John-Angus MacDonald said &quot;We were sitting around the apartment and watching all the coverage from CNN and Fox, it just seemed so blatantly obvious they were beating around the bush. The problem was how did this kid have a gun in the first place? It's a personal and political view from us.&quot;[2]\n\nThe first single, &quot;Hold Me in Your Arms&quot;, was released on November 25, 2007. It premiered at the 2007 Grey Cup pre-game show and was immediately released on iTunes. The music video premiered on January 9, 2008.[4] The second single, &quot;Paranoid Freak&quot;, was released April 2008. It has quickly gained radio-play in Canada. The third single was &quot;Man of Two Minds&quot; released September 2008. The Albums latest single is &quot;Can't Stop Laughing&quot; which was co-written by Ron Hynes.\n\nAmy O'Brian of the Vancouver Sun described the album as &quot;nothing particularly ground-breaking [...] but it is a raucous romp of guitars, drums and even a taste of bagpipes. It's a strong set of 13 songs over 50 minutes.&quot; She criticized the choice for the cover art, writing &quot;it's a shame they chose the cover art that they did because there are certain people (such as myself) who will judge an album by its cover before listening to it. [...] It's neither a flattering nor fitting image for The Trews.&quot;[9]\n\nThe songs &quot;Paranoid Freak&quot; and &quot;Dark Highway&quot; were used in the eight season premiere of the hit Canadian drama Degrassi: The Next Generation.\n\nThe album debuted at #4 on the Canadian Albums Chart[10] but fell from the top ten the following week.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;No Time for Later&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27 (Colin MacDonald, John-Angus MacDonald, Simon Wilcox)\n2.\t&quot;Dark Highway&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:19\n3.\t&quot;Be Love&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20\n4.\t&quot;I Feel the Rain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55\n5.\t&quot;Paranoid Freak&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22 (Colin MacDonald, John-Angus MacDonald, Syperek, Dalton, Gordie Johnson)\n6.\t&quot;I Can't Stop Laughing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22 (Colin Macdonald, John-Angus MacDonald, Syperek, Dalton, Ron Hynes)\n7.\t&quot;Man of Two Minds&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59 (Colin MacDonald, John-Angus MacDonald, Wilcox)\n8.\t&quot;Hold Me in Your Arms&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:07\n9.\t&quot;Gun Control&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58\n10.\t&quot;Will You Wash Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:19\n11.\t&quot;End of the Line&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:49 (Colin MacDonald, John-Angus MacDonald, Syperek, Dalton, Gus van Go)\n12.\t&quot;Burning Wheels&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:18\n13.\t&quot;Ocean's End&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcoustic - Friends &amp; Total Strangers 2009\n\n\nAcoustic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Friends &amp; Total Strangers is both a live acoustic album and a music DVD by Canadian rock band The Trews.
