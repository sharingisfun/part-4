Completely crushed, Lottie reconnects with an old flame, and they decide to take drastic action. No dates, no moving in together, they'll just get married . . . right now. Her sister, Fliss, thinks Lottie is making a terrible mistake, and will do anything to stop her. But Lottie is determined to say &quot;I do,&quot; for better, or for worse.\r\nPraise for Wedding Night","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:569ad2c2270431d196f1f34810a5cbd2ed50a1a2","amp;dn":"Sophie+Kinsella-Wedding+Night","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"569ad2c2270431d196f1f34810a5cbd2ed50a1a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,154,210,194,39,4,49,209,150,241,243,72,16,165,203,210,237,80,161,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
