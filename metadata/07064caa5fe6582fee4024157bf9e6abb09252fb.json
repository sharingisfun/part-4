My release is the BEST on PirateBay as the other two don't work! One is packaged into an obscure DaemonTools format, that doesn't work anyway, and the other one flatout just doesn't work! \n\nMine is imaged straight from my retail CD I thought I'd lost, and has a v1.1 Patch and crack, plus an 100% SAVEGAME that I tested and added, in a standard ISO, that WORKS!! None of the others have these BONUSES!\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Mount or burn the ISO image.\n\n2. Install the game.\n\n3. Install the PATCH first, in the &quot;v1.1 Patch&quot; folder.\n\n4. Then copy the executable from the v1.1 Crack folder into the program installation folder, default is &quot;x&quot;:\\Program Files\\Atari\\Crashday\\, where &quot;x&quot; is the letter of your system drive. If you're on 64bit Windows, it'll be in the Program Files(x86)\\Atari\\Crashday\\ folder.\n\n5. If you wish, copy the files from inside the Savegame folder into the &quot;savegame&quot; folder in the game folder, see above step for location of the game.\n\nTesting Results\n\nTested extensively by me, Tidosho. No viruses or spyware, I passionately hate those!! The only known issue is that the intro videos appear mirrored and upside down, the rest of the game works fine. Tested on 64bit Windows 7 on a Uniwill P55IM laptop (Core 2 Duo 2.20GHz, Intel 965 chipset, 2GB RAM and 256MB nVidia GeForce 8600M GS). All settings fan fine on full, although \nthe game is naturally a little jitter, that happens on an i7 rig even with the latest Radeon HD card! I think the game is a port or something!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nIf you downloaded this anywhere else other than Tidosho's page at the PirateBay (www.thepiratebay.se/user/Tidosho) make sure to stop \nby the Bay and check out my other torrents and give thanks or say Hi!
