The album was mixed by the dub master himself, King Tubby, at Tubby's legendary Waterhouse facility.\n\nThe result is an exceptional and unique dub album.\n\n\n\nKing Tubby Meets Jacob Miller \n\nIn a Tenement Yard\n\n1976\n\n\n\n  CD / 2006 / 320Kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.\t\nDreada Dread Dub\n\n2.\t\nDon't Let Dub Fool You\n\n3.\t\nDey Call It Dub\n\n4.\t\nSuzie Wong Dub\n\n5.\t\nJudgement Yard Dub\n\n6.\t\nJah Jah Land Dub\n\n7.\t\nCity Of The Weakheart Dub\n\n8.\t\nRoman Soldiers Of Dub\n\n9.\t\nDub Has Come Again\n\n10.\t\nLick Weed Dub\n\n11.\t\n80000 Dubs\n\n12.\t\nGhetto on Fire Dub\n\n\nBonus Tracks:\n\n13. \nDub the Weak Heart [#]\n\n14. \nGhetto on Fire [#] (Dangerous Version)\n\n\n\nKing Tubby Meets Jacob Miller / In a Tenement Yard /1976","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edf4b9331cac20dc2f02d01f98f3e5e679a001c3","amp;dn":"King+Tubby+meets+Jacob+Miller%3A+In+a+Tenement+Yard+%281976%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edf4b9331cac20dc2f02d01f98f3e5e679a001c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,244,185,51,28,172,32,220,47,2,208,31,152,243,229,230,121,160,1,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
