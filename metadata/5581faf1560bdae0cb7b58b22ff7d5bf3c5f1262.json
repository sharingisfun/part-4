Matt Frei looks at how this US presidential contest is shaping up to be one of the most brutal in living memory. Clinton says Trump isn't fit for President, while Trump has called for Clinton to be locked up and has even been accused of hinting that she should be assassinated. Frei asks if Trump can really make it all the way to the White House or if he'll be crushed by the Clinton machine. He meets Trump supporters and conflicted Republicans. Considering his derogatory remarks on women, he also asks whether Trump can really win over the all significant female vote. The experts continue to predict the Trump insurgency is doomed to crash and burn, but they said the same about Brexit. A Trump America could well be a reality.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e0/President-Trump-Can-He-Really-Win-Part-2-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ac/President-Trump-Can-He-Really-Win-Part-2-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/59/President-Trump-Can-He-Really-Win-Part-2-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/91/President-Trump-Can-He-Really-Win-Part-2-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cf/President-Trump-Can-He-Really-Win-Part-2-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fa/President-Trump-Can-He-Really-Win-Part-2-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e1/President-Trump-Can-He-Really-Win-Part-2-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c7/President-Trump-Can-He-Really-Win-Part-2-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7e/President-Trump-Can-He-Really-Win-Part-2-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~2265Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.48 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 47 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 806 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/on-demand","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5581faf1560bdae0cb7b58b22ff7d5bf3c5f1262","amp;dn":"Ch4+President+Trump+Can+He+Really+Win+Part+2+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5581faf1560bdae0cb7b58b22ff7d5bf3c5f1262","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,129,250,241,86,11,218,224,203,123,88,178,47,247,213,191,60,95,18,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
