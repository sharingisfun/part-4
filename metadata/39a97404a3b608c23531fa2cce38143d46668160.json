Probably so. It's the only one I need. It's got all the best songs, the remastered sound is excellent, and the liner notes and\npackaging are top-notch. Everybody and their mother knows the smash hit &quot;Happy\nTogether&quot; and most people know at least half a dozen of these other songs even if they don't know they're all by The Turtles. All the essentials are here: the four &quot;me&quot; songs: Let It Be Me, It Ain't Me Babe, She'd Rather Be With Me, and You Showed Me plus the four &quot;you&quot; songs: You Know What I Mean, You Baby, You Don't Have To Walk In The Rain, Can I Get To Know You Better. And then there's the &quot;me and you&quot; song, or should I say the &quot;imagine me and you&quot; song...\n\nIf you're a fan of sixties pop you need a Turtles CD in your collection. This one.\n--  By E. D.
