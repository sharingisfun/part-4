Well, the Arizona ensembleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s marriage of desolate country-rock and mariachi music never pitched itself at the youth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but there used to be blaring trumpets and daring attitude too. Ã¢â‚¬ËœAlgiersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, their seventh album, is far less surface-level appealing, but the sad twang of a pedal steel and Joey BurnsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ rich lyrical imagery draw you in, and depth and craftsmanship is slowly revealed. Ã¢â‚¬ËœParaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ might produce curious converts, if only for sounding weirdly like Ã¢â‚¬ËœParanoid AndroidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, while Ã¢â‚¬ËœPuertoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the border-jumping highlight.
