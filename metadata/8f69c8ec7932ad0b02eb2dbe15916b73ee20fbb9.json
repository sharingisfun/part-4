He's signed up for an emigration program that is colonizing the planet of New Pennsylvania. He just wants to start a farm and homestead on affordable land in a new Amish community.\n\nSpace pioneering isn't as easy as it sounds when you're &quot;plain.&quot; Jedidiah and his new friend Dawn arrive on New Pennsylvania in the middle of a rebel uprising, and Trace, the resistance group that is rising up against Transport, has taken on the mission of getting Jed from the City to the Amish Zone. Being a stranger in the old world doesn't even compare to being a stranger in a new world... a world that is at war and where nothing is what it seems.\n\nRead by Andrew McFerrin\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f69c8ec7932ad0b02eb2dbe15916b73ee20fbb9","amp;dn":"Michael+Bunker+-+Pennsylvania+%28Pennsylvania+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f69c8ec7932ad0b02eb2dbe15916b73ee20fbb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,105,200,236,121,50,173,11,2,235,45,190,21,145,107,115,238,32,251,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
