When Fermina eventually chooses to marry a wealthy, well-born doctor, Florentino is devastated, but he is a romantic. As he rises in his business career, he whiles away the years in 622 affairs - yet he reserves his heart for Fermina. Her husband dies at last, and Florentino purposefully attends the funeral. Fifty years, nine months, and four days after he first declared his love for Fermina, he does so again.\n\nWith humorous sagacity and consummate craft, Gabriel GarcÃƒÂ­a MÃƒÂ¡rquez traces an exceptional half-century of unrequited love. Though it seems never to be conveniently contained, love flows through the novel in many wonderful guises - joyful, melancholy, enriching, and ever surprising.\n\nAudible Audio Edition\nListening Length: 15 hours and 46 minutes\nProgram Type: Audiobook\nVersion: Unabridged\nPublisher: Blackstone Audio, Inc.\nAudible.com Release Date: August 27, 2013\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B00EFB306Q\n\n[Read by Armando Duran]\n\nThe Author:\n__\n\nGabriel JosÃƒÂ© de la Concordia GarcÃƒÂ­a MÃƒÂ¡rquez (6 March 1927 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 17 April 2014) was a Colombian novelist, short-story writer, screenwriter and journalist, known affectionately as Gabo throughout Latin America. Considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century, he was awarded the 1972 Neustadt International Prize for Literature and the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature. He pursued a self-directed education that resulted in his leaving law school for a career in journalism. From early on, he showed no inhibitions in his criticism of Colombian and foreign politics. In 1958, he married Mercedes Barcha; they had two sons, Rodrigo and Gonzalo.\n\nGarcÃƒÂ­a MÃƒÂ¡rquez started as a journalist, and wrote many acclaimed non-fiction works and short stories, but is best known for his novels, such as One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967), The Autumn of the Patriarch (1975) and Love in the Time of Cholera (1985). His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style labeled as magic realism, which uses magical elements and events in otherwise ordinary and realistic situations. Some of his works are set in a fictional village called Macondo (the town mainly inspired by his birthplace Aracataca), and most of them explore the theme of solitude.\n\nR.I.P Gabriel GarcÃƒÂ­a MÃƒÂ¡rquez (6 March 1927 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 17 April 2014)\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s18.postimg.org/hpuzsq9mx/RIP.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s18.postimg.org/hpuzsq9mx/RIP.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n_____\n\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
