Kerlin (ISA, 1999).pdf\r\n\r\nThis book is intended to provide a resource to help the user select, install and use thermocouples properly. Temperature is the most commonly measured quantity in industry and thermocouples are the most common device for making temperature measurements. Since there is a tremendous incentive to optimize the selection, installation and use of thermocouples, the author presents a general understanding about the principles of thermocouple thermometry.
