Most of the serious guesses were some variation on Thom Yorke or Panda Bear, but \nit turns out to be the Notwist, the German electronic-prog band who hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t released an album since 2008.\nDepending on where youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re sitting, the news of a new Notwist album on Sub Pop is either a tremendous anticlimax or a badass\n piece of news Ã¢â‚¬â€ or maybe itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s both. Either way, the label will release Close To The Glass, the first new Notwist album in nearly\n six years, on February 25.2014\n\n=================================\n\nTracklist\n\n01 Ã¢â‚¬Å“SignalsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n02 Ã¢â‚¬Å“Close To The GlassÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n03 Ã¢â‚¬Å“KongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n04 Ã¢â‚¬Å“Into Another TuneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n05 Ã¢â‚¬Å“CasinoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n06 Ã¢â‚¬Å“From One Wrong Place To The NextÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n07 Ã¢â‚¬Å“7-Hour-DriveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n08 Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Fifth Quarter Of The GlobeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n09 Ã¢â‚¬Å“Run Run RunÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n10 Ã¢â‚¬Å“SteppinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ InÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n11 Ã¢â‚¬Å“LineriÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n12 Ã¢â‚¬Å“They Follow MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n===================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 280 MB\nAlbum                                    : Close To The Glass\nTrack name/Total                         : 12\nComposer                                 : The Notwist\nGenre                                    : Electronic/Indie/Rock\nRecorded date                            : 2014\nComment                                  : EAC V1.0 beta 2, Secure Mode, Test &amp; Copy, AccurateRip, FLAC -8\nAlbum/Composer                           : The Notwist / The Notwist\n\n======================================\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : FLAC\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 913 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10022ccea1e4a167d5877a79052f9c4275de4a3c","amp;dn":"The+Notwist+-+Close+To+The+Glass+%282014%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10022ccea1e4a167d5877a79052f9c4275de4a3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,2,44,206,161,228,161,103,213,135,122,121,5,47,156,66,117,222,74,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
