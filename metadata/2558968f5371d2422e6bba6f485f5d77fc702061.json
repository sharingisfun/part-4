Thieves steal time and the timekeepers control the\nsociety. When the worker Will Salas saves the rich Henry Hamilton from a\ndangerous gang of thieves, Henry tells that he is 105 years old and is tired\nof living, since there is no need for the deaths in the unfair society. When\nWill sleeps, Henry gives more than one hundred years to him and commits\nsuicide. Will runs to meet his mother Rachel Salas to credit time to her but\nshe dies before the transference. Will heads to New Greenwich but the\ntimekeeper Raymond Leon believes that he killed Henry to steal his time.\nWill flirts with Sylvia Weis, who is the spoiled daughter of the millionaire\nPhilippe Weis, in a party and when Raymond arrests him, Will Salas kidnaps\nSylvia and brings her to the ghetto where he lives. Sylvia feels how\ndespicable her father is and together with Will, they steal a large\nquantity of time to fight against the system.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Justin Timberlake.\n=&gt;-Amanda Seyfried.\n=&gt;-Cillian Murphy.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Andrew Niccol.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Action : Sci-Fi : Thriller.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2011.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.64 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 2 144 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 50mn.\n=&gt;-In Time....................: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/in_time/\n=&gt;-In Time....................: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/in-time/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.40:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1920 x 800.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 2011 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 128 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 254 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2558968f5371d2422e6bba6f485f5d77fc702061","amp;dn":"In+Time+-+Justin+Timberlake+Sci-Fi+2011+Eng+Subs+1080p+%5BH264-mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2558968f5371d2422e6bba6f485f5d77fc702061","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,88,150,143,83,113,210,66,46,107,186,111,72,95,93,119,252,112,32,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
