Paralleling his outer education, his inner education about life, family, sexuality and spiritual values is revealed. By the time he achieves his doctorate, he has been told that he has a life-shortening heart disease. However, because of his two-fold education, he is fulfilled in what he has done and is not much distressed. This Polish film, by the notable director Krzysztof Zanussi, won many awards at Italian film festivals.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Iluminacja (1973).avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,179,291,648 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:27:30\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 720x400 (AR: 1.800)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1647 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.229 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 137 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n\n\nNot my rip. \n\nPOLISH AUDIO, ENGLISH AND PORTUGUESE SUBTITLES.\n\n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
