Python is a natural choice for new and experienced developers, and this hands-on resource is a much needed guide to enterprise-level testing development methodologies. The book will show you why Unit Testing and TDD can lead to cleaner, more flexible programs.\n\nUnit Testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD) are increasingly must-have skills for software developers, no matter what language they work in. In enterprise settings, it's critical for developers to ensure they always have working code, and that's what makes testing methodologies so attractive. This book will teach you the most widely used testing strategies and will introduce to you to still others, covering performance testing, continuous testing, and more.\n\nLearn Unit Testing and TDDÃ¢â‚¬â€important development methodologies that lie at the heart of Agile development\nEnhance your ability to work with Python to develop powerful, flexible applications with clean code\nDraw on the expertise of author David Sale, a leading UK developer and tech commentator\nGet ahead of the crowd by mastering the underappreciated world of Python testing\n\nKnowledge of software testing in Python could set you apart from Python developers using outmoded methodologies. Python is a natural fit for TDD and Testing Python is a must-read text for anyone who wants to develop expertise in Python programming.\n\nFrom the Back Cover\n\nClearly defines testing fundamentals and best practices\nProvides comprehensive overview of unit testing methods\nExplains how to implement Test Driven Development\nCovers acceptance testing and tools needed to perform acceptance tests\n\nApply Acceptance Testing, Test-Driven Development, Unit Testing, and Behavior-Driven Development to Python\n\nUnit testing and test-driven development (TDD) are increasingly must-have skills for software developers, no matter what language they work in. In enterprise settings, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s critical for developers to ensure they always have working code, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what makes testing methodologies so attractive. More recently, behavior-driven development (BDD) has taken testing to a new level, and this book will introduce you to the practice and tools to take up this exciting modern style of testing your software. This book will teach you the most widely used testing strategies and will introduce to you to still others, covering performance testing, continuous testing, and more. Learn to:\n\nGet your hands dirty with the basic building blocks in testing: unit tests\nEffectively embed unit tests in your doc strings and have them run as tests\nAdopt the concepts and ethos of test-driven development (TDD)\nDeploy smoke testing and get to grips with Pylint\nWrite and undertake acceptance testing with Cucumber, Lettuce, and Robot\nAnalyse and find problem areas within your code using JMeter and cProfile\nSuccessfully implement continuous integration\n\nAbout the Author\n\nDavid Sale is currently a software developer for British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB), where he works predominantly with Python and Java. He quickly began making his presence known in the Python Community, having written web articles on various Python topics. David has also given talks on Behaviour Driven Development and Agile Development at the EuroPython conference. He writes about technology for Nettuts+ and Tech.Pro.\n\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0e0bef2da319ba0294e1ff161390aa40b6e0a63","amp;dn":"Testing+Python+-+David+Sale+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0e0bef2da319ba0294e1ff161390aa40b6e0a63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,224,190,242,218,49,155,160,41,78,31,241,97,57,10,164,11,110,10,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
