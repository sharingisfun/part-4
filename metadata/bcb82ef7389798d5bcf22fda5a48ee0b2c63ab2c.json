But the band had a lengthy \nhistory prior to its international breakthrough, dating all the way \nback to the late '60s. They hit the big time in Jamaica during the \n'70s as a danceable yet rootsy Rastafarian reggae outfit, fronted by \nthe charismatic singer Jacob Miller. Miller's tragic death in a car \naccident in 1980 put the group on hiatus for several years, and when \nthey finally regrouped in the mid-'80s, they began to temper their \nrootsiness with elements of pop, R&amp;B, and dancehall.\n\nFormed: 1968 in Jamaica\n\nStyles:\n\nReggae-Pop\nContemporary \nReggae\n\nGroup Members:\n\nIan Lewis\nRoger Lewis\nCarlton Coffie\nLancelot Hall\nMichael &quot;Ibo&quot; Cooper\nSteven &quot;Cat&quot; Coore\nRichard Daley\nJacob Miller\nBernard Touter Harvey\nTouter Harvey\nKris Bentley\n\nInfluenced By:\n\nJacob Miller\nJimmy Cliff\nBob Marley\nGregory Isaacs\nDelroy Wilson\n\n\nTrack list:\n\nDisc 1\n\n1.
