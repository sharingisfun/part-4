For that reason, the very idea of a Cat Stevens greatest-hits collection may be troublesome to some fans, since they will only notice the missing album tracks, but Greatest Hits does its job exceptionally well. With the exception of &quot;The Hurt,&quot; all of his hits from the early '70s --\n&quot;Wild World,&quot; &quot;Moon Shadow,&quot; &quot;Peace Train,&quot; &quot;Morning Has Broken,&quot; &quot;Sitting,&quot; &quot;Oh Very Young,&quot; &quot;Another Saturday Night,&quot; &quot;Ready,&quot; and &quot;Two Fine People&quot; -- are here, along with three other fine album tracks. In short, it is everything that casual fans need -- and even fans that find a favorite or two missing will be hard-pressed to deny that this is a solid introduction and a\ngreat listen.\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Wild world                                           [03:19]\n02.Oh very young                                        [02:35]\n03.Can't keep it in                                     [03:00]\n04.Hard headed woman                                    [03:49]\n05.Moonshadow                                           [02:50]\n06.Two fine people                                      [03:33]\n07.Peace train                                          [04:13]\n08.Ready                                                [03:16]\n09.Father &amp; son                                         [03:42]\n10.Sitting                                              [03:13]\n11.Morning has broken                                   [03:19]\n12.Another saturday night                               [02:28]\n____\n\n39:17 min\n 58,1 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
