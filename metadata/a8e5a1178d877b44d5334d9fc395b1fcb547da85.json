Or canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t collect it where you need it. Upon these principles, wearable technology was born. And although smart watches and fitness trackers have become almost ubiquitous, with in-body sensors on the horizon, the future applications of wearable computers hold so much more. A trusted reference for almost 15 years, Fundamentals of Wearable Computers and Augmented Reality goes beyond smart clothing to explore user interface design issues specific to wearable tech and areas in which it can be applied.\nFrom a technology perspective, much of what is happening now with wearables and augmented reality would not have been possible even five years ago. In the fourteen years since the first edition burst on the scene, the capabilities and applications of both technologies are orders of magnitude faster, smaller, and cheaper. Yet the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s overarching mission remains the same: to supply the fundamental information and basic knowledge about the design and use of wearable computers and augmented reality with the goal of enhancing peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lives.\n\nAbout the Author\nWoodrow Barfield, PhD, JD, LLM, has served as professor of engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, where he received the National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Award. Professor Barfield directed the Sensory Engineering Laboratory, where he was involved in research on sensors and augmented and virtual reality displays. He has served as a senior editor for Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments and is an associate editor for Virtual Reality. He has more than 350 publications and presentations, including invited lectures and keynote talks, and holds two degrees in law.\n\nBRIEF CONTENTS\nPreface....ix\nAcknowledgments....xi\nEditor.... xiii\nContributors....xv\nSection I Introduction\nSection II The Technology\nSection III Augmented Reality\nSection IV Wearable Computers and Wearable Technology\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s16.postimg.org/6o8nxcu8l/Fundamentals_of_Wearable_Computers_and_Augmented.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s16.postimg.org/6o8nxcu8l/Fundamentals_of_Wearable_Computers_and_Augmented.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8e5a1178d877b44d5334d9fc395b1fcb547da85","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Wearable+Computers+and+Augmented+Reality+%282nd+Ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8e5a1178d877b44d5334d9fc395b1fcb547da85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,229,161,23,141,135,123,68,213,51,77,159,195,149,177,252,181,71,218,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
