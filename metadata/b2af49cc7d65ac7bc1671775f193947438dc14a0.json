Many critics consider Enter The Wu-Tang one of the most significant albums of the 1990s and one of the greatest hip hop albums recorded. The distinctive sound of Enter the Wu-Tang created a blueprint for hardcore hip hop in the mid-1990s and helped return New York City hip hop to national prominence. The Wu-Tang Clan's debut was a landmark album in an era known as the East Coast Renaissance. The group's leader, RZA, produced the album with heavy, eerie beats, largely based on martial-arts movie clips and soul music samples. The album is named after the 1978 martial arts film The 36th Chamber of Shaolin.\n\nThe unique sound of Enter the Wu-Tang became hugely influential in modern hip hop production. The album also marked the first appearance of a number of rappers-including Method Man, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Ghostface Killah, and Raekwon- who have collectively sold millions of solo records. The lyrics of Enter the Wu-Tang are explicit, humorous, and free-associative, and served as a template for many subsequent hip hop records.[6] The Source declared that the first two singles from Enter the Wu-Tang, &quot;Protect Ya Neck&quot; and &quot;C.R.E.A.M.&quot;, are among the 100 Best Rap Singles yet released. Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) had surprising chart success, despite its raw, underground sound. Its highest Billboard 200 chart ranking was number 41, and by May 15, 1995, it was certified platinum in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America. The style and success of Enter the Wu-Tang became influential as it helped lead the way for such East Coast rap artists as Nas, The Notorious B.I.G., Mobb Deep, and Jay-Z. In 2003, the album was ranked number 386 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\n\nLabel: Loud Records, RCA, BMG\nCatalog#: 74321 20367 2, 74321 20367 2, 74321 20367 2\nFormat: CD, Album, Mp3\nCountry: Europe\nReleased: 1993\nGenre: Hip Hop\nStyle: Gangsta\nBitRate: 320 kbps (VBR)\nCredits: Artwork By [Art Direction] - Jacqueline Murphy\nArtwork By [Design] - Amy Wenzler\nArtwork By [Set Designer] - Richard Bravo/Cartel\nCo-producer - Method Man, The* (tracks: 7) , Ol' Dirty Bastard (tracks: 6)\nEngineer - Carlos Bess (tracks: 6) , Ethan Ryman (tracks: 1 to 5, 7 to 13)\nExecutive Producer - Dennis Coles , Mitchell Diggs , Oli Grant , Robert Diggs , Tracy Waples (tracks: 13)\nMastered By - Chris Gehringer\nOther [A &amp; R] - Trevor Williams\nOther [Production Supervisor] - John Gibbons , Mike McDonald , Mitchell Diggs , Oli Grant , Theodore Michael\nPhotography - Daniel Hastings/Cartel\nProducer, Mixed By, Arranged By - Prince Rakeem &quot;The RZA&quot;*\nProgrammed By - Prince Rakeem*\nScratches - 4th Disciple, The*\nWritten-By - Clifford Smith (2) (tracks: 13) , Robert Diggs (tracks: 13) , Wu-Tang Clan, The*\n\nNotes: Producer, mixed and arranged for Wu-Tang Productions.\nRecorded and mixed at Firehouse Studio, NY, NY.
