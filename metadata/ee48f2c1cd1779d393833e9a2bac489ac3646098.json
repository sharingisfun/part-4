He was instrumental in the development of chamber music such as the piano trio[2] and his contributions to musical form have earned him the epithets &quot;Father of the Symphony&quot; and &quot;Father of the String Quartet&quot;.[3]\r\n\r\nHaydn spent much of his career as a court musician for the wealthy EsterhÃ¡zy family at their remote estate. Until the later part of his life, this isolated him from other composers and trends in music so that he was, as he put it, &quot;forced to become original&quot;.[n 3] Yet his music circulated widely and for much of his career he was the most celebrated composer in Europe.\r\n\r\nJoseph Haydn, a friend and mentor of Mozart, and teacher of Beethoven, was the older brother of composer Michael Haydn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1-3 Sonata in E minor, HOB XVI.34\r\n4-6 Sonata in B minor, HOB XVI.32\r\n7-8 Sonata in D major, HOB XVI.42\r\n9 Fantasia in C major, HOB XVII.4\r\n10 Adagio in F major, HOB XVII.9\r\n\r\n\r\nTOTAL TIME 54:34\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReality Ascent by Dragan Glavasic\r\nWAKE UP!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12:17 PM 8/26/2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee48f2c1cd1779d393833e9a2bac489ac3646098","amp;dn":"Haydn+-+Piano+Sonatas+%5BFLAC%5D+Brendel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee48f2c1cd1779d393833e9a2bac489ac3646098","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,72,242,193,205,23,121,211,147,131,62,154,43,172,72,154,195,100,96,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
