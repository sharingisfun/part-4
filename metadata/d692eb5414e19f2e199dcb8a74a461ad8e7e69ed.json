As an infant, she was thought to be the daughter of a famous root doctor--and was abandoned in an ancient Low Country cemetery. Growing up, she was haunted by her possible connection to the local Gullah culture--with its spells and voodoo. Now, however, there's a twisted killer on the loose, and the city is gripped by terror. Someone is using a substance that leaves its victims in a state that mimics death. As their bodies slip into an irreversible paralysis, their minds remain fully, shockingly awake.\r\n\r\nBEFORE YOU WAKE UP DEAD\r\n\r\nStep by step, Elise's relentless chase for the killer draws her straight back into the world she most fears. And now, to stop a murderer, she must confront the truth about her own past in ways she never could have imagined...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d692eb5414e19f2e199dcb8a74a461ad8e7e69ed","amp;dn":"Anne+Frasier+-+Play+Dead+%28Elise+Sandburg+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d692eb5414e19f2e199dcb8a74a461ad8e7e69ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,146,235,84,20,225,159,46,25,157,203,138,116,164,97,173,142,126,105,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
