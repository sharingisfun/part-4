Problem solving and mathematical modeling are introduced early and reinforced throughout, providing students with a solid foundation in the principles of mathematical thinking. Comprehensive and evenly paced, the book provides complete coverage of the function concept, and integrates a significant amount of graphing calculator material to help students develop insight into mathematical ideas. The authors' attention to detail and clarity, the same as found in James Stewart's market-leading Calculus book, is what makes this book the market leader.\n\nAbout the Authors\nJames Stewart received his M.S. from Stanford University and his Ph.D. from the University of Toronto. He did research at the University of London and was influenced by the famous mathematician George Polya at Stanford University. Stewart is currently a Professor of Mathematics at McMaster University. His research field is harmonic analysis. James Stewart is the author of a best-selling calculus textbook series published by Brooks/Cole, including CALCULUS, 5th Edition, CALCULUS: EARLY TRANSCENDENTALS, 5th Edition, and CALCULUS: CONCEPTS AND CONTEXTS, 3rd Edition, as well as a series of precalculus texts.\nLothar Redlin grew up on Vancouver Island, received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Victoria, and a Ph.D. from McMaster University in 1978. He subsequently did research and taught at the University of Washington, the University of Waterloo, and California State University, Long Beach. He is currently Professor of Mathematics at The Pennsylvania State University, Abington College. His research field is topology.\nSaleem Watson received his Bachelor of Science degree from Andrews University in Michigan. He did graduate studies at Dalhousie University and McMaster University, where he received his Ph.D. in 1978. He subsequently did research at the Mathematics Institute of the University of Warsaw in Poland. He also taught at The Pennsylvania State University. He is currently Professor of Mathematics at California State University, Long Beach. His research field is functional analysis.\n\nCONTENTS\nCHAPTERP PREREQUISITES 1\nCHAPTER1 EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES 59\nCHAPTER2 COORDINATES AND GRAPHS 125\nCHAPTER3 FUNCTIONS 183\nCHAPTER4 POLYNOMIAL AND RATIONAL FUNCTIONS 265\nCHAPTER5 EXPONENTIAL AND LOGARITHMIC FUNCTIONS 339\nCHAPTER6 TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS: RIGHT TRIANGLE APPROACH 407\nCHAPTER7 TRIGONOMETRI CFUNCTIONS: UNIT CIRCLE APPROACH 467\nCHAPTER8 ANALY TIC TRIGONOMETRY 531\nCHAPTER9 POLAR COORDINATES AND PARAMETRIC EQUATIONS 579\nCHAPTER10 VECTORS IN TWO AND THREE DIMENSIONS 617\nCHAPTER11 SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES 667\nCHAPTER12 CONIC SECTIONS 761\nCHAPTER13 SEQUENCES AND SERIES 821\nCHAPTER14 COUNTING AND PROBABILITY 877\nAPPENDIX: C alculations and S ignific ant Figures 919\nANSWERS A1\nINDEX I1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fff3ec9c249d67022037f739d1b2abf1d1dca848","amp;dn":"Algebra+and+Trigonometry+%283rd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fff3ec9c249d67022037f739d1b2abf1d1dca848","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,243,236,156,36,157,103,2,32,55,247,57,209,178,171,241,209,220,168,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
