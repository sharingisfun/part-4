Originally released in France by Sonodisc in 1984 and 1988, they have been unavailable for years.\n\nBoth albums are entirely acoustic, with minimal accompaniment on calabash and ngoni (a traditional four-string guitar), which perfectly complements TourÃƒÂ©'s percussive guitar style and plaintive, keening vocals.\n \nThe music bears a striking resemblance to the modal blues of American artists like Son House and John Lee Hooker, yet it is deeply West African, with scales and motivic flourishes indigenous to the culture, and lyrical themes that reflect TourÃƒÂ©'s life in rural Mali.\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Red &amp; GreenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a must for TourÃƒÂ© fans: a blissful, early dose of this singular artist's superb music.\n\n\n\nAli Farka TourÃƒÂ©\n\nRed &amp; Green\n\n2004\n\n \n 2CDs / 2004 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist / CD 1 / Ã¢â‚¬Å“RedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½:\n\n1.
