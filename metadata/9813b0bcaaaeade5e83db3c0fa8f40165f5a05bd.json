Step up to M-Tron Pro! This is GForce's big daddy, with over 3 gigs of sounds, including nifty loops, BBC Radiophonic effects, synth samples, E-bowed guitars, and other goodies.\n\nThose who have other mellotron software will find new sounds in here. It's quite a bank of sounds. You certainly want to get it. But there are some disappointments as well. For one, it seems that the &quot;remastered&quot; sounds presented here are not clean and fresh and high-generation, like the Venice Audio mellotron banks, but rather slightly cleaned-up versions of the tapes they already had. In some cases, I might even say the non-remastered versions included sound slightly better. Also, you don't get some of the newer sounds that are going around, like the new cello or electric cello. Furthermore, the &quot;sad strings&quot; are once again all by themselves instead of with the bossa nova, where they should be (those strings were meant to be bossa nova accompaniment! You weren't meant to just play several minutes of sad strings all by themselves!) And the rhythms are still presented without accompaniment.\n\nI don't know how this will fit into my arsenal yet. For some sounds I might turn to it. But when I want the lush remastered sound of certain instruments, like strings, I might still go for the Venice Audio library. And for the vintage sound, the Mike Pinder bank is still indispensable. Still, this has some good ones that I think I'll keep. I like the clarinet, and the E-bowed guitar. And a few others I don't have in other libraries might stick to me.\n\nPS: Works on Macs and PCs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9813b0bcaaaeade5e83db3c0fa8f40165f5a05bd","amp;dn":"GForce.M-Tron.Pro.v1.0.VSTi.DXi.RTAS.AU.HYBRiD.DVDR-DYNAMiCS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9813b0bcaaaeade5e83db3c0fa8f40165f5a05bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,19,176,188,170,174,173,229,232,61,179,192,250,143,64,22,95,90,5,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
