In addition, a number of discs in the box set contain bonus tracks.\nHerbert Jeffrey Ã¢â‚¬Å“HerbieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hancock of Chicago, Illinois began his association with Columbia Records while part of DavisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ remarkable Second Great Quintet. He appeared as part of the group beginning with 1965Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s E.S.P., all the while maintaining a career as leader at Blue Note.  (He also made numerous other appearances as an in-demand sideman during this landmark early period.)  In 1969, he moved over to Warner Bros. Records before finding a long-term home at Columbia in 1973 with Sextant, the first album in the new box set.  It was quickly followed by Head Hunters, on which he was joined by Bennie Maupin, Paul Jackson, Bill Summers and Harvey Mason.  Head Hunters blended jazz and funk, becoming one of the best-selling jazz albums of all time and a watershed moment for jazz-fusion.  The album, with four lengthy tracks including three originals and a new interpretation of HancockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard-bop period Ã¢â‚¬Å“Watermelon Man,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ remains a high point in his career.  He remained at Columbia through 1988Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Perfect Machine, all the way exploring, experimenting, and innovating.\n\nThe Complete Columbia Album Collection allows the listener to trace HancockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s art from the evolution from the Ã¢â‚¬Å“MwandishiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Sextet to the Head Hunters to the Herbie Hancock Group to the V.S.O.P. group.  The latter band reprised the line-up of DavisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Second Great Quintet, with Freddie Hubbard (no slouch himself) standing in for Miles.  Along with Herbie Hancock Trio and Quartet lineups, Hancock stretched on solo projects and a duet concert with another piano/keyboard great (and Davis alumnus) Chick Corea.  Soundtracks to Death Wish (1974) and Round Midnight (1986) are also included in the box.\n\nCollectors will also likely salivate at the inclusion of the eight CBS/Sony Japan albums: Dedication (solo, both acoustic and electric, live in the studio, without overdubs, 1974); Flood (the Head Hunters Band live, 1975); The Herbie Hancock Trio (with Ron Carter and Tony Williams, studio, 1977); Tempest in the Colosseum (V.S.O.P. with Hubbard, Shorter, Carter, and Williams, live, 1977); Directstep (full band, studio, direct-to-disc, 1978);  Five Stars (V.S.O.P. lineup, their only studio album, direct-to-disc, 1979); Butterfly (full electric band with singer Kimiko Kasai, studio, 1979); and Herbie Hancock Trio With Ron Carter + Tony Williams (studio, 1981).  Two more albums recorded and released in Japan were reissued in 2004 by Columbia/Legacy for the first time on CD in the U.S. with bonus tracks.  The extras have been retained for The Piano (solo, acoustic piano, direct-to-disc, 1978, recorded one week after Directstep); and V.S.O.P. / Live Under The Sky (1979).\n\nProduced by Grammy winner Richard Seidel, The Complete Columbia Album Collection is housed in a deluxe box with a removable lid.  Each album will be packaged in a mini-LP replica of the original jacket, with original artwork including gatefolds where applicable.  Most impressively, the set boasts a 200-page book.  Another Grammy winner, Bob Belden, has contributed a 5,500-word essay plus album-by-album notes from Hancock discographer/historian Max Schlueter.  And thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still not all.  The label is promising Ã¢â‚¬Å“one of the most detailed discographies ever included in a Legacy box set, assembled by box producer Richard Seidel.  Included are full musician lineups and instrumentation, recording data (dates, producers, engineers, mixers, studios, etc.), exact original release dates in both the U.S. and Japan, cross references for additional appearances of various songs elsewhere in the box, Billboard chart information, R.I.A.A. certifications, and a short-form discography of HancockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s solo recording career before and after his Columbia years.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAlso included in the book will be sidebars on Hancock as pianist, composer and synthesist, written by Belden.  Schlueter has written a sidebar, too, on noted record producer David Rubinson, who produced all but six of the albums in the box set.  Another sidebar is devoted to HancockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s late sister, the lyricist Jean Hancock.  The total immersion continues with a glossary of the more than 60 different electronic instruments played by Hancock and the other musicians throughout the albums.  Mark Wilder and Maria Triana at Battery Studios have completely remastered The Complete Columbia Album Collection for optimum sound.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5c5b50b9803f4fe8a4e1a2975d04f06ae395a5a","amp;dn":"Herbie+Hancock+-+Columbia+Album+Collection++%5B34+CD%5D+%282013%29+MP3%403","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5c5b50b9803f4fe8a4e1a2975d04f06ae395a5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,197,181,11,152,3,244,254,138,78,26,41,117,208,79,6,174,57,90,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
