As a result, Styler recorded on film much of the struggle, controversy, and troubles that went into making the picture (including the moment when producer Fullmer called Sting to inform the pop star that his songs were being deleted from the film). Styler's completed documentary, The Sweatbox, premiered at the Toronto Film Festival on September 13, 2002. Disney owns the rights to the documentary and has not released it on home video or DVD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db59f3956470390122ef1cbdfc37f425a2fa1794","amp;dn":"The+Sweatbox+%282002%29+Screener","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db59f3956470390122ef1cbdfc37f425a2fa1794","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,89,243,149,100,112,57,1,34,239,28,189,252,55,244,37,162,250,23,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
