The recording sessions, by contrast, were completed in a single day, under the guidance of first-time arranger Mike Gibbs and with the support of a twenty-seven-piece orchestra. The interplay between GibbsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ bright, lush instrumental arrangements and FayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s measured chording on piano and frail, modest vocals reinforces the recordingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s constant vacillation between hopeful reassurance and utter dissatisfaction with modern life. In the opening tune, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Garden Song,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Fay announces that he has planted himself in a garden to escape from the senseless distractions of the modern world and to develop real, Ã¢â‚¬Å“lasting relationsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with nature. His communal bliss is short-lived, however, as he relates in song after song the intrusions of violence and alienation into the most isolated frontiers of personal solitude. Even nature itself has become dissatisfied, unhappy, and desperate to escape the current situation. Ã¢â‚¬Å“And the moon is praying,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Fay relates in Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Sun Is Bored.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“It wants to get away to some other place. Any place.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ In the midst of his bleakest observations, Fay continues to hope, and urges his listeners to do the same. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Be not so nervous; be not so frail,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he counsels in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Be Not So Fearful,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s penultimate tune. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Someone watches over you; you will not fail.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Whether the Ã¢â‚¬Å“someoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in question is God, nature or the wise, benevolent singer himself remained open to debateÃ¢â‚¬â€at least until his next recording\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:352eb00b466680a505babadf14e5b28cc5486af8","amp;dn":"Bill+Fay+-+Bill+Fay+%5B1970%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"352eb00b466680a505babadf14e5b28cc5486af8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,46,176,11,70,102,128,165,5,186,186,223,20,229,178,140,197,72,106,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
