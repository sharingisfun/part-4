The film's many layers intertwine real life and family relationships - Tarkovsky's father, the poet Arseny Tarkovsky, reads his own poems on the soundtrack and Tarkovsky's mother appears as herself - with memories of childhood, dreams and nightmares. From the opening sequence of a boy being cured of a stammer by hypnotism, to a scene in a printing works which encapsulates the Stalinist era, 'MIRROR' has an extraordinary resonance and repays countless viewings.\n\n\nwww.freakyflicks.tk\n\nSEED AS LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE!\n\n'If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, this torrent will NEVER DIE'\n\n... simply search for 'freakyflicks' \n*************************************** \n************** FREAKYFLICKS ************* \n***************************************\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb4e43468624834abda02b7f2ae20ddbd091c662","amp;dn":"Mirror+%28Andrei+Tarkovsky%2C+1975%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb4e43468624834abda02b7f2ae20ddbd091c662","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,78,67,70,134,36,131,74,189,160,43,127,42,226,13,219,208,145,198,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
