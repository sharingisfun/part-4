Be it a Crumb book or an anthology. There may be a couple of new short pieces, I just can't find confirmation one way or the other. Still a nice collection of stories focusing on one theme (one that should be pretty clear from the title). A nice introduction of Crumb newbies (if there are any of those out there) and another one of the missing pieces for completists.\n\n\n\nFile donated by thewickerman586\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51dc68e7b2b8bb6288bb1d98fb68d6d52771280e","amp;dn":"Robert+Crumb+-+My+Troubles+With+Women","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51dc68e7b2b8bb6288bb1d98fb68d6d52771280e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,220,104,231,178,184,187,98,136,187,29,152,251,104,214,213,39,113,40,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
