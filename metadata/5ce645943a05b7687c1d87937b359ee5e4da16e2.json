Each of his records has a specific mood and theme, standing as an individual work. That said, his albums have also been notoriously uneven. Sometimes, as on From Her to Eternity or The Boatman&amp;#039;s Call, he has delivered near-masterpieces, while on other albums, only a handful of songs have hit the mark accurately, which is why The Best of Nick Cave is a welcome addition to his catalog. Granted, the title is a bit odd (it&amp;#039;s better than Greatest Hits, however), but the compilation itself is as good as it could possibly be. All the major songs -- &quot;Red Right Hand,&quot; &quot;Straight to You,&quot; &quot;Nobody&amp;#039;s Baby Now,&quot; &quot;Into My Arms,&quot; &quot;Do You Love Me?,&quot; &quot;Henry Lee,&quot; &quot;Where the Wild Roses Grow,&quot; &quot;From Her to Eternity&quot; -- are on this 16-track collection, along with several strong album cuts. Some hardcore fans will find a couple of favorites missing, and the disc should have been sequenced in chronological order, but The Best of Nick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds is nevertheless a terrific single-disc overview of his rewarding, occasionally inaccessible work with the Bad Seeds; it&amp;#039;s ideal for both the curious and the casual fan.
