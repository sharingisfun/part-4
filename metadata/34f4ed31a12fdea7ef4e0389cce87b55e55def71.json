JavaScript, however, isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t easy and staying up to date with recent trends makes it even harder. You need a way to integrate the latest technology into your web site without having to start from the beginning.\n\n&quot;Learning Kendo UI Web Development&quot; shows you how to add the latest web features to your site without doing all of the work yourself. The experts at Telerik have created a fully supported code library that lets you focus on what makes your sites special while letting them focus on how that translates into cutting edge JavaScript code.\n\nThis book will take you on a survey through Kendo UI for the web from the basic widgets that wrap input fields to the full page scaffolding widgets for setting up your site.\n\nKendo UI for the web is a rich framework of JavaScript widgets and tools that will add immediate value to your web sites. Learn the full spectrum of what Kendo UI has to offer in specialized widgets that gather input from users by displaying calendars, sliders, or date pickers all the way up to widgets that structure your web pages through data-driven models in accordions, tabs, list views, and tree views.\n\n&quot;Learning Kendo UI Web Development&quot; is the perfect companion for navigating the broad features offered by Telerik in JavaScript web development.\n\nApproach\n\nA practical tutorial with step-by-step example based approach.\n\nWho this book is for\n\nThis book is for web developers who want to take advantage of cutting edge JavaScript and HTML 5 web site features, but who donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the time or the knowledge to write all of that code by hand. The reader should be familiar with basic HTML 5 and JavaScript but does not need to be an expert.\n\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34f4ed31a12fdea7ef4e0389cce87b55e55def71","amp;dn":"Learning+Kendo+UI+Web+Development","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34f4ed31a12fdea7ef4e0389cce87b55e55def71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,244,237,49,161,47,222,167,239,78,3,137,204,232,123,85,229,93,239,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
