Yes, you heard right: growing more mushrooms may be the best thing we can do to save the environment. Microscopic cells called &quot;mycelium&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the fruit of which are mushrooms ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½recycle carbon, nitrogen, and other essential elements as they break down plant and animal debris in the creation of rich new soil. What fungi expert Paul Stamets has discovered is that mycelium also breaks down hydrocarbons ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the base structure in many pollutants. So, for instance, when soil contaminated with diesel oil is inoculated with strains of oyster mushroom mycelia, the soil loses its toxicity in just eight weeks. In MYCELIUM RUNNING, Stamets discusses this revolutionary trend in mushroom cultivation and provides tips for choosing the appropriate species of fungi for various environmental purposes.\n\nReviews\nAs a physician and practitioner of integrative medicine, I find this book exciting and optimistic because it suggests new, nonharmful possibilities for solving serious problems that affect our health and the health of our environment. Paul Stamets has come up with those possibilities by observing an area of the natural world most of us have ignored. He has directed his attention to mushrooms and mycelium and has used his unique intelligence and intuition to make discoveries of great practical import. I think you will find it hard not to share the enthusiasm and passion he brings to these pages.\n--From the foreword by Andrew Weil, MD, author of Eating Well for Optimum Health\n \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStamets is a visionary emissary from the fungus kingdom to our world, and the message heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s brought back in this book, about the possibilities fungi hold for healing the environment, will fill you with wonder and hope.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ\n --Michael Pollan, author of The Botany of Desire\n \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis is the kind of book I love: highly factual and practical and mixed with the spiritual content that sets the great writers apart from all the rest.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ\n--John Norris, former deputy commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and founder of the Bioterrorism Institute\n \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis is the first book to give the Kingdom of the Fungi its proper place in the scheme of things.

StametsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s visionary insights are leading to a whole new understanding of how mushrooms, scarcely seen and rarely appreciated, regulate the earthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ecosystems.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ  \n--John Todd, founder and president of Ocean Arks International\n \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis visionary and practical book should be an instant classic in the emerging science of how to use natureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wisdom and fecundity to rescue the earth and ourselves from the unwelcome consequences of human cleverness.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ \n--Amory B.
