But because some people don't feel their doctors see those methods as legitimate, patients often turn to unreliable sources such as the internet, celebrities, etc. for guidance. With so much misinformation out there, how does anyone know which advice to follow and what actually works?\n\nIn this book, Dr. Mel Borins answers these questions using the latest scientific research and double-blind studies to educate patients and physicians alike on which alternative treatments work, which donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, and why. And more importantly, it teaches them how to safely use these alternative treatments, as a reputable source of information to supplement their conventional medicine treatments. Written in clear, accessible language for the layperson while providing citations to full studies for the medical professional, the book covers traditional healing and herbal remedies, physical therapies, psychological therapies, and natural health products","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6834e2f7076594afc040c69c9c69350ed56c524e","amp;dn":"A+Doctor%27s+Guide+to+Alternative+Medicine%3A+What+Works","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6834e2f7076594afc040c69c9c69350ed56c524e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,52,226,247,7,101,148,175,192,64,198,156,156,105,53,14,213,108,82,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
