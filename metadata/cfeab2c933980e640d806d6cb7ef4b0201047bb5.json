Using dramatic reconstructions, documentary filming around the world and cutting-edge computer graphics, he reveals the decisive moments that shaped the world we live in today, telling stories we thought we knew and others we were never told.\n\nStarting with our earliest beginnings in Africa, Marr traces the story of our nomadic ancestors as they spread out around the world and settled down to become the first farmers and townspeople. He uncovers extraordinary hand-prints left in European caves nearly 30,000 years ago and shows how human ingenuity led to inventions which are still with us today. He also discovers how the first civilisations were driven to extremes to try to overcome the forces of nature, adapting and surviving against the odds, and reveals how everyday life in ancient Egypt had more in common with today's soap operas than might be imagined.\n\nTechnical Specs \nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1515 kbps \nVideo Resolution: 720 x 416\nVideo Aspect Ratio:  (16:9) \nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) \nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 59mins \nNumber Of Parts: 8\nPart Size:701 MB\nSource: PDTV\n Encoded by Harry65\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfeab2c933980e640d806d6cb7ef4b0201047bb5","amp;dn":"BBC.Andrew.Marr.s.History.of.the.World.1of8.Survival.PDTV.XviD..","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfeab2c933980e640d806d6cb7ef4b0201047bb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,234,178,201,51,152,14,100,13,128,109,108,183,239,75,2,1,4,123,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
