Thanks to whoever was the first to upload it, and to 'LAKER' who cracked it.\n\nThis is a plea, request to anybody with the required skills - is there a keygen out there?  Or a much later cracked version?  It's already on  version 0.98...\n\nI would be eternally greatful if someone could upload the above.\n\nP.S. - I've made quite a number of maps with this, including perfectly working routable ones - works perfectly.\n\nHave fun!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaadea1450b6a6d25aff3d6066f75890682b0417","amp;dn":"cgpsmapper_cracked.commercial.routable.v0.92_191","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaadea1450b6a6d25aff3d6066f75890682b0417","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,173,234,20,80,182,166,210,90,255,61,96,102,247,88,144,104,43,4,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
