Pyotr Ilyich Chaykovsky; 25 April/7 May 1840 â€“ 25 October/6 November 1893),[a 2] often anglicised as Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky /ËˆpiËtÉ™r .../, was a Russian composer of the late-Romantic period, some of whose works are among the most popular music in the classical repertoire. He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally, bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States.\r\n\r\nFor 12 years (1971â€“1983) Maestro BÃ¡tiz was the conductor of the State of Mexico Symphony Orchestra (Orquesta SinfÃ³nica del Estado de MÃ©xico) before moving to the Mexico City Philharmonic Orchestra for seven years (1983â€“1989). In 1990 he resumed his directorship of the OSEM, which continues to the present. In 1984, he was named guest conductor of Englandâ€™s Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and, as an invited guest conductor, has conducted more than 500 symphony orchestras around the world.\r\n\r\nIf you want a FLAC version, just ask for it =D\r\n\r\nReport for file: Symphony No.2 in C minor, Op.17 &quot;Little Russian&quot; - 1 Andante Sostenuto - Allegro Vivo.mp3\r\n\r\nGeneral / Container Stream #1\r\n\tTotal Audio Streams for this File.................1\r\n\tAudio Codecs Used.................................MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\r\n\tFile Format.......................................MPEG Audio\r\n\tPlay Time.........................................10mn 26s\r\n\tTotal File Size...................................23.9 MiB\r\n\tTotal Stream BitRate..............................320 Kbps\r\n\tTitle (Tag).......................................Symphony No.2 in C minor, Op.17 &quot;Little Russian&quot; - 1 Andante Sostenuto - Allegro Vivo\r\n\tEncoding Library..................................iTunes 11.0.1\r\nAudio Stream #1\r\n\tCodec.............................................MPEG Audio\r\n\tAudio Stream Length...............................10mn 27s 252ms\r\n\tAudio Stream BitRate..............................320 Kbps\r\n\tAudio Stream BitRate Mode.........................CBR\r\n\tNumber of Audio Channels..........................2\r\n\tSampling Rate.....................................44.1 KHz\r\n\tAudio Stream Size.................................23.9 MiB (100%)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0717a44a1b233cac1a3544c4039c4a109cde3c86","amp;dn":"Tchaikovsky+-+Complete+Symphonies+%5BBa%CC%81tiz%2C+OSEM%5D+%281997%29+MP3+320k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0717a44a1b233cac1a3544c4039c4a109cde3c86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,23,164,74,27,35,60,172,26,53,68,196,3,156,74,16,156,222,60,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
