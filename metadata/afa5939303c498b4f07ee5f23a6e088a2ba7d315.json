The children are placed in the custody of their distant cousin Count Olaf, who begins to abuse them and openly plots to embezzle their inheritance. After the Baudelaires are removed from his care by their parents' estate executor, Arthur Poe, Olaf begins to doggedly hunt the children down, bringing about the serial slaughter and demise of a multitude of characters.\n\nThe entire series is actively narrated by Snicket, who makes numerous references to his mysterious, deceased love interest, Beatrice. Both Snicket and Beatrice play roles in the story along with Snicket's family members, all of whom are part of an overarching conspiracy known to the children only as &quot;V.F.D.&quot;\n\nSince the release of the first novel, The Bad Beginning, in September 1999, the books have gained significant popularity, critical acclaim, and commercial success worldwide, spawning a film, video game, and assorted merchandise. The thirteen books in the series (or &quot;tridecalogy&quot;) have collectively sold more than 60 million copies and have been translated into 41 languages.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afa5939303c498b4f07ee5f23a6e088a2ba7d315","amp;dn":"A+Series+of+Unfortunate+Events+-+Lemony+Snicket","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afa5939303c498b4f07ee5f23a6e088a2ba7d315","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,165,147,147,3,196,152,180,240,126,229,242,58,110,8,138,43,167,211,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
