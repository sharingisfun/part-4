It is the story of speculators, swindlers, corporate moguls and the crimes they commit in their hunt for wealth. It is the story of ambition that corrupts, and of the way organized criminals launder their ill-gotten gains. A story of our world the economic crisis almost overturned five years ago, and which is still holding its breath as it waits for the next bubble to burst and for the next economic tsunami to strike. And of course, it is the story of us human beings - the rich, the poor, the greedy, the fraudulent, the robbers who'll go to any lengths to build the lives of our dreams.\r\n\r\nWhen the body of a man is washed ashore near a wind farm, police detective Mads is called out to investigate. At first, it merely looks like an industrial accident, but the case implicates the upper echelons of Energreen - one of Denmark's most successful and leading energy companies. The CEO of Energreen is the charismatic Sander, and young lawyer Claudia is working hard to advance in the company. Nicky, a former car thief and mechanic, works at his father-in-law's garage. He has put his life of crime behind him for his girlfriend's sake, but his new colleague Bimse tempts Nicky with a chance to make a quick buck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow.The.Money.s01e02\r\nFollow.The.Money.s01e03\r\nFollow.The.Money.s01e04\r\nFollow.The.Money.s01e05\r\nFollow.The.Money.s01e06\r\nFollow.The.Money.s01e07\r\nFollow.The.Money.s01e08\r\nFollow.The.Money.s01e09\r\n\r\n\t---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow.The.Money.s01e10\r\n\r\nThe media are shocked by Energreen's announcement, and Mads and Alf are busy searching for evidence to use against them.
