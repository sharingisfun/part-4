It is the most exciting book about Pluto you will ever read in your life.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Jon Stewart \nWhen the Rose Center for Earth and Space at the American Museum of Natural History reclassified Pluto as an icy comet, the New York Times proclaimed on page one, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pluto Not a Planet? Only in New York.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Immediately, the public, professionals, and press were choosing sides over PlutoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s planethood.
