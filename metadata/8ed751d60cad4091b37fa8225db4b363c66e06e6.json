The group was formed in 1977 and was most active throughout the 1980s.\n\nDoug Bennett was the band's namesake and lead singer. He continued to perform with the group until his death in October 2004.\n\nThe song &quot;Too Bad&quot; not only was their first hit, it was used as the theme song for The Norm Show, a 1999-2001 sitcom starring Norm Macdonald.\n\nA reunited Doug &amp; The Slugs features 4 Original Members with new singer Ted Okos.\n\nFor the entirety of their recording career (1978-1992), Doug &amp; The Slugs consisted of lead vocalist Doug Bennett, guitarists Richard Baker and John Burton, keyboardist Simon Kendall, bassist Steve Bosley and drummer John &quot;Wally&quot; Watson. Most of the Slugs left the band after 1992 (Kendall stayed until 1994); after this time, Bennett toured with an ever-rotating cast of new musicians, still billing the act as Doug &amp; The Slugs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlugcology 101 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ A Decade of Doug and the Slugs \n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nToo Bad\nChinatown Calculation\nReal Enough\nWho Knows How (To Make Love Stay)\nMaking it Work\nDrifting Away\nTomcat Prowl\nDay by Day\nLove Shines\nPowerful Thing\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Got to be Monday\nDangerous\nTo Be Laughing\n(I DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Want To) Walk Away\nWhite Christmas\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ed751d60cad4091b37fa8225db4b363c66e06e6","amp;dn":"Doug+and+the+Slugs+-+Slugcology+%28Greatest+Hits%29+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ed751d60cad4091b37fa8225db4b363c66e06e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,215,81,214,12,173,64,145,179,127,168,34,93,180,179,99,198,110,6,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
