In a scene where musicianship and integrity are often overshadowed by image, Counterparts have consistently proven themselves to be among the most promising young bands the genre has to offer. The bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique blend of hardcore sounds is instantly recognisable.\n\nPummeling verses and breakdowns seamlessly transition into bright melodies, bound together by an unwavering message of hope and overall positivity. Needless to say, Counterparts have come a long way since their formation in 2007. With a fan base that has progressively expanded beyond the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home province, Counterparts have toured Canada relentlessly since March 2009. The bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s upward trajectory truly took off after the release of their debut full-length, Prophets, in February 2010.\n\nThe Verona Records release turned heads across the country, as well as beyond its borders. The album was an immediate hit among fans of the hardcore genre, simultaneously garnering praise from scene luminaries and newcomers. Its impact was bold and far-reaching, going so far as to earn the band several award nominations throughout Ontario.\n\nAt a point when most bands would take time off to relax, Counterparts proved themselves once again to be as hardworking as they come. In November 2010, the band released a split EP alongside Ontario-based hardcore unit Exalt. Their passion for writing and playing music that is genuine has allowed them to surpass the expectations that anyone had for them at the beginning of their career.\n\nThe band are more determined than ever before to make a lasting impact on the contemporary heavy music scene, and their infectious spirit continues to inspire fans everywhere they go. Armed with heart and hope, Counterparts plan on spreading their music and message as far and wide as humanly possible in the coming years.  \n\nThe members are:\n   Brendan Murphy (lead vocals)\n   Jesse Doreen (guitar)\n   Eric Bazinet (bass)\n   Kelly Bilan (drums, percussion)\n   Adrian Lee (guitar)\n\n\nArtist...............: Counterparts\nAlbum................: Discography\nGenre................: Melodic Hardcore\nSource...............: FLAC\nYear.................: 2010-2013\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) / LAME MP3\n \nIncluded.............: COVER ART, ID TAGS, FLAC &amp; MP3\n\n\n\n\n                            Album Info:\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                           Prophets (2010) \n\n                            Tracklisting                                        \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
