What is possible for our society? Who are the politicians who will be shaping our future? What is it like to run for election?\r\nThese are some of the core questions explored in Vote, a landmark new documentary for BBC NI.\r\nWith access to the campaigns of five political candidates on the road to the 2016 Northern Ireland Assembly election, Vote explores the themes of democracy and citizenship in a changing Northern Ireland.\r\nThrough intimate and candid interviews and access to their campaigns over several weeks, Vote reveals the personal stories of five candidates putting their livelihoods and reputations on the line, in the fight to become elected.\r\nIn the wake of another year of political upheaval and controversy, and following a new agreement, the documentary considers what drives people to become engaged in political life in Northern Ireland and shines a light on electoral politics, a fundamental part of democracy.\r\nFrom the 276 candidates fighting for 108 seats across the 18 constituencies, Vote goes behind the scenes with five hopeful candidates from the five main parties - the DUP, Sinn Fein, SDLP, Alliance and UUP.\r\nAll five candidates represent the next generation of politicians who, as typical of our representatives, are taking on the responsibility of helping shape our society and our future.\r\nThe five featured candidates are: Emma Little Pengelly (DUP, Belfast South), Megan Fearon (Sinn Fein, Newry and Armagh), Doug Beattie (UUP, Upper Bann), Claire Hanna (SDLP, Belfast South), and Naomi Long (Alliance Party, Belfast East).\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2c/Vote-BBC-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/af/Vote-BBC-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c4/Vote-BBC-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/92/Vote-BBC-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/30/Vote-BBC-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3f/Vote-BBC-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/44/Vote-BBC-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e7/Vote-BBC-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3a/Vote-BBC-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~1700Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.47 VBR 48KHz (~127Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 768 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07vd076","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0947bd6d3148522abee67e69a2e92e2b3431200d","amp;dn":"BBC+Vote+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0947bd6d3148522abee67e69a2e92e2b3431200d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,71,189,109,49,72,82,42,190,230,126,105,162,233,46,43,52,49,32,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
