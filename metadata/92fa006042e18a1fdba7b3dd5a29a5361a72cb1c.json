However, the band reformed around 1986 and have continued being active today, even after the death of longtime guitarist Dennis Danell, who succumbed to a brain aneurysm in 2000. Since its inception the band lineup has been a virtual revolving-door of talent, with many members coming and going ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Ness has been the only constant member.\n\nTo date, Social Distortion has released seven full-length studio albums, two compilations, one live album and two DVDs. The band released its debut album Mommy's Little Monster in 1983, which was quite popular in the United States. Social Distortion did not release a second album, Prison Bound, until 1988. That album attracted the attention of Epic Records, who signed the band in 1989 and issued their highly successful self-titled third album a year later, which peaked at number 128 on the Billboard 200, and featured their well-known hit singles &quot;Ball and Chain&quot;, &quot;Story of My Life&quot; and the cover of Johnny Cash's &quot;Ring of Fire.&quot; The next three albums, Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell, White Light, White Heat, White Trash and Sex, Love and Rock 'n' Roll were also well-received but not as successful as the self-titled album. Social Distortion released their most recent studio album, Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes, on January 18, 2011, which was the fourth anniversary of the death of former Social Distortion bassist Brent Liles. The band also released their first Greatest Hits compilation on June 26, 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMommy's Little Monster 1983\n\n\nMommy's Little Monster is the first album by American punk rock band Social Distortion, released in 1983 (though the CD erroneously notes 1982).[2]\n\nThe album was critically-acclaimed but was, however, not commercially successful. The album includes their live staples &quot;The Creeps&quot;, &quot;Another State of Mind&quot;, &quot;Telling Them&quot; and the title track, which has been frequently played by KROQ.\n\nIn 1982, Social Distortion took part in the tour with Youth Brigade (as chronicled in the documentary Another State of Mind) and broke up shortly afterwards. However, because of the tour's success, the band reconciled not long afterward and decided to begin work on their first album. They recorded the album in a single session. Mommy's Little Monster was recorded at The Casbah in Fullerton, California, on December 24, 1982, for numerous hours to cut down studio costs, which explains low budget production.\n\nThe exposure afforded to Social Distortion from the tour and subsequent documentary led to Mommy's Little Monster being a surprise hit despite being self-released. However, the album went out of print in the mid-1980s after leader Mike Ness started to take the checks that were coming in to 13th Floor Records and which were meant to be put towards future pressings of the album or new releases, and used them to subsidize his drug habit.\n\nMommy's Little Monster was reissued several times, with different formats and labels. The album was originally released on vinyl LP in 1983 on 13th Floor Records, a label owned by their manager at the time, Monk Rock.\n\nThe Triple X Records label reissued the album on vinyl and cassette in 1989. Six years later, Mommy's Little Monster was re-issued once again when Ness started Time Bomb Recordings with some of the profits he made from Social Distortion's Epic releases, and reissued Mommy's Little Monster on vinyl, cassette and CD through a distribution deal with Arista Records. The 1995 version has remained in print ever since.\n\nTo date[when?], the 13th Floor and Triple X versions remain out of print.\n\nA gramophone picture disc version of Mommy's Little Monster was released in 2001, but it is also rare\n\nThe cover of the album has an image of a skeleton and human child (wearing a mask), who are seated in a chair watching a war movie featuring a mushroom cloud in a somewhat abandoned house, with nothing except for the chair, television, mailbox, three lead pipes and a lot of debris. It is suggestive of the after effects of an early hydrogen bomb test and an archetypal hardcore image. The album cover was designed by Art Morales.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;The Creeps (I Just Wanna Give You)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:03\n2.\t&quot;Another State of Mind&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:38\n3.\t&quot;It Wasn't a Pretty Picture&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10\n4.\t&quot;Telling Them&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:12\n5.\t&quot;Hour of Darkness&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:49\n6.\t&quot;Mommy's Little Monster&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n7.\t&quot;Anti-Fashion&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:19\n8.\t&quot;All the Answers&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:23\n9.\t&quot;Moral Threat&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrison Bound 1988\n\n\nPrison Bound is the second studio album by Social Distortion, was released in 1988. This is the first album with bass guitarist John Maurer and drummer Christopher Reece. It expands upon the punk sound of the band's highly regarded but commercially unsuccessful first album Mommy's Little Monster (1983) by adding elements of Johnny Cash style country and The Rolling Stones style rock and roll.\n\nToday, Prison Bound is looked upon as a turning point for Social Distortion, paving the way for the commercial success they achieved on their next album, Social Distortion, which was released two years later.\n\nAfter this album was released, Social Distortion left Restless / Enigma Records in 1989 and moved to Epic Records for their self-titled album.\n\nThe first track, &quot;It's the Law&quot;, was originally titled &quot;Justice for All&quot;, which has the same lyrics. &quot;Justice for All&quot; later appeared on the 1995 compilation album Mainliner: Wreckage from the Past. The fifth track, &quot;Prison Bound&quot;, was only released as a single on KROQ-FM. The album contains a cover version of &quot;Backstreet Girl&quot; originally recorded by the Rolling Stones. The album's title track contains a reference to Johnny Cash's &quot;I Walk the Line&quot;. The band went on to cover Cash's &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; on their next album.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;It's the Law&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:38\n2.\t&quot;Indulgence&quot; (Danell/Ness) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34\n3.\t&quot;Like an Outlaw (For You)&quot; (Danell/Ness) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:21\n4.\t&quot;Back Street Girl&quot; (Jagger/Richards) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22\n5.\t&quot;Prison Bound&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:24\n6.\t&quot;No Pain No Gain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42\n7.\t&quot;On My Nerves&quot; (Danell/Ness) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:23\n8.\t&quot;I Want What I Want&quot; (Danell/Ness) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:02\n9.\t&quot;Lawless&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21\n10.\t&quot;Lost Child&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Distortion 1990\n\n\nSocial Distortion is the third and self-titled album by the American punk rock band Social Distortion, released on March 27, 1990, through Epic Records. After touring in support of its previous full-length studio album, Prison Bound (1988), Social Distortion signed with Epic in 1989 and began work on its first album for a major label. The album furthered the rockabilly, blues and country music experimentation of their previous album with songs like &quot;Drug Train&quot; and the radio hit &quot;Ball and Chain&quot;.\n\nThe focus on the alternative rock scene helped bring attention to Social Distortion. The singles &quot;Story of My Life&quot; and &quot;Ball and Chain&quot; were able to find an audience on alternative rock radio and on MTV. Social Distortion was the band's most successful album to date, and their first to enter the Billboard 200; the release peaked at number 128. The album has been certified gold by the RIAA in the United States.\n\n&quot;Story of My Life&quot; is a playable song in the videogame Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. &quot;Story of My Life&quot; and &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; were later released as downloadable content for the Rock Band.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;So Far Away&quot; (Maurer/Ness) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37\n2.\t&quot;Let It Be Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16\n3.\t&quot;Story of My Life&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:48\n4.\t&quot;Sick Boys&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:19\n5.\t&quot;Ring of Fire&quot; (June Carter Cash, Merle Kilgore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51\n6.\t&quot;Ball and Chain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:44\n7.\t&quot;It Coulda Been Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52\n8.\t&quot;She's a Knockout&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52\n9.\t&quot;A Place in My Heart&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:15\n10.\t&quot;Drug Train&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomewhere Between Heaven &amp; Hell 1992\n\n\nSomewhere Between Heaven and Hell is the fourth studio album by the American punk rock band Social Distortion, released on February 11, 1992. It continues the melding of country and rockabilly influences with punk that began two albums before with Prison Bound. Clear influences include Hank Williams (on &quot;This Time Darlin'&quot;) and Johnny Cash (on &quot;99 To Life&quot;). The album also marks the first time that a Social Distortion line-up had not changed in three consecutive studio recordings.\n\nThis was the last Social Distortion album with drummer Christopher Reece, who was replaced in 1993 by Randy Carr.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Cold Feelings&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:31\n2.\t&quot;Bad Luck&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:26\n3.\t&quot;Making Believe&quot; (Jimmy Work) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:12\n4.\t&quot;Born to Lose&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09\n5.\t&quot;Bye Bye Baby&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:06\n6.\t&quot;When She Begins&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:04\n7.\t&quot;99 to Life&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28\n8.\t&quot;King of Fools&quot; (W.E.

The album was produced by Michael Beinhorn. White Light, White Heat, White Trash is the last Social Distortion album to feature guitarist Dennis Danell who died on February 29, 2000, of a cerebral aneurysm at the age of 38[1]. It is also the band's last release on Epic Records. The album received Social Distortion's highest ever chart position, entering the Billboard 200 album chart at #27. Stylistically, the album is harder and considered a return to their punk roots.\n\nThe title of the album is a play on the 1968 Velvet Underground album, White Light/White Heat. The Velvet Underground record is known for being one of the most original, and probably the heaviest, records of the time[citation needed], just as White Light, White Heat, White Trash for Social Distortion has a harder sound than those albums preceding it.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Dear Lover&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:43\n2.\t&quot;Don't Drag Me Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51\n3.\t&quot;Untitled&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:45\n4.\t&quot;I Was Wrong&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58\n5.\t&quot;Through These Eyes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:15\n6.\t&quot;Down on the World Again&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22\n7.\t&quot;When the Angels Sing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15\n8.\t&quot;Gotta Know the Rules&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:28\n9.\t&quot;Crown of Thorns&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15\n10.\t&quot;Pleasure Seeker&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n11.\t&quot;Down Here (With the Rest of Us)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:19\n12.\t&quot;Under My Thumb&quot; (Mick Jagger/Keith Richards) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:49 *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSex Love and Rock 'n' Roll 2004\n\n\nSex, Love and Rock 'n' Roll is the sixth album by American punk rock band Social Distortion. It is their first studio album in eight years, since the release of White Light, White Heat, White Trash in 1996, the longest gap between Social Distortion's studio albums to date. The album was originally scheduled to be released in the fall of 2000, but was not yet completed, and it was officially released on September 28, 2004. A great deal of the album is a musical eulogy to former guitarist Dennis Danell, who died in 2000. The album's opening track, &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot;, was released in late 2004 and became one of Social Distortion's biggest hits.\n\nSocial Distortion could not release a follow-up to White Light, White Heat, White Trash partly because of their various other activities, most obviously those of frontman Mike Ness. He released two solo albums in 1999, one with original material (Cheating at Solitaire) and one with song covers (Under the Influences). Due to his touring schedule with the band, Sex, Love and Rock 'n' Roll was set aside for a number of years before finally being completed in 2004.\n\nThe song &quot;Nickels and Dimes&quot; is a play on hardcore punk band Minutemen masterpiece album &quot;Double Nickels on the Dime&quot;.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Reach for the Sky&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:31\n2.\t&quot;Highway 101&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44\n3.\t&quot;Don't Take Me for Granted&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n4.\t&quot;Footprints on My Ceiling&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:08\n5.\t&quot;Nickels and Dimes&quot; (J.

Work on the album began in 2006 and it was originally forecast for a 2007 release, but was pushed back several times while the band continued touring and writing new material. After four years of writing, Social Distortion recorded the album from February to July 2010 at Ocean Studios in Burbank, California. Drummer Atom Willard left the group during the recording sessions in favor of his other band, Angels &amp; Airwaves. He was temporarily replaced by Scott Reeder before David Hidalgo, Jr. joined as the band's new permanent drummer. Despite being listed as a band member on the album, Hidalgo did not actually play on it; instead, the band hired session musician Josh Freese to record the drum tracks. Social Distortion is currently touring in support of Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Road Zombie&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;California (Hustle and Flow)&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Gimme the Sweet and Lowdown&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Diamond in the Rough&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Machine Gun Blues&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Bakersfield&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Far Side of Nowhere&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Alone and Forsaken&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Writing on the Wall&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Can't Take It With You&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Still Alive&quot;  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreatest Hits 2007\n\n\n\nGreatest Hits is a compilation album by Social Distortion.

It includes hit singles from Mommy's Little Monster to Sex, Love and Rock 'n' Roll - as well as the unreleased track &quot;Far Behind&quot;, which also became a hit single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ yet lacks anything from Mainliner, which is actually a compilation of unreleased early material.\n\n&quot;Far Behind&quot; is also the band's first new song recorded with then-current line-up of Mike Ness (vocals, guitars), Jonny &quot;2 Bags&quot; Wickersham (guitar), Brent Harding (bass guitar) and Charlie Quintana (drums).\n\nThe limited edition vinyl for this album contains an interview with Mike Ness.[1][2]\n\nA bonus track, a studio recording of a new Social Distortion cover version of the Chuck Berry classic &quot;Maybellene&quot;, is available through the iTunes music store in the US. On the UK version, the bonus track is &quot;1945&quot; (13th Floor Records version), which was previously released as a single, as a B-side on the Story of My Life EP, and on Mainliner.\n\nBy July 11, 2007, the album had sold 13,462 copies in the US.\n\n&quot;Story of My Life&quot; and a live version of &quot;Mommy's Little Monster&quot; appear in the music videogames Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock and Guitar Hero: Metallica, respectively.
