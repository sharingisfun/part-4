Industry pro Deke McClelland takes a project-based learning approach to the key features in Illustrator CC, including Recolor Artwork, transparency, masks, blend modes, strokes and fills, and dynamic effects. The course also covers techniques for creating custom gradients, designing logos, generating photorealistic neon text, and wrapping type around objects. Plus, Deke shows how to call up the most essential features by organizing your workspace and employing time-saving keyboard shortcuts, how to manage the color settings, and how to adjust a few settings to make the program work even better.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6729c4b4d682107e30b0047aefcfef62f50d53aa","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Illustrator+CC+One-on-One%3A+Advanced","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6729c4b4d682107e30b0047aefcfef62f50d53aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,41,196,180,214,130,16,126,48,176,4,122,239,207,239,98,245,13,83,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
