Installing applications by walking around is so 1990. Automation is the name of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s game, and nothing spells Windows automation like System Center Configuration Manager. Automation has been called the Windows AdministratorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s force multiplier. With the right tools, it enables a well-prepared administrator to monitor and enact change to exactly the right devices at exactly the right time.\n \nPrepping you to use those tools and wield that incredible power is the reason behind this video series. Presented by respected CBT Nuggets trainer and Microsoft MVP Greg Shields, this series delivers a broad and deep exposure into MicrosoftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ConfigMgr 2012. GregÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been working with ConfigMgr since its early days as SMS 2.0. Over the years heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s developed a second sense for managing Windows desktops and servers with this powerful toolkit. He shares from his personal experience in this series to deliver not only the science (what buttons to click), but also the art (why you should click them) of managing a Windows infrastructure with ConfigMgr 2012.\n \nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to package and deploy software and virtual applications, as well as how to automate everything from individual configurations to entire OS deployments. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn the foundations of what you need to know for certification success, but youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also learn a few ConfigMgr best practices the consultants rarely share.\n \nIn a Windows world where clicking Next, Next, Finish is no longer good enough, smart IT professionals know that automation savvy is key to guaranteed employment. Join Greg in this ConfigMgr 2012 deep dive to develop exactly those skills thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll make you the Most Valuable Professional of your own IT organization.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51638c5403f658fcd023238e23508e3290013048","amp;dn":"CBT+Nuggets+Microsoft+System+Center+Configuration+Manager+SCCM+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51638c5403f658fcd023238e23508e3290013048","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,99,140,84,3,246,88,252,208,35,35,142,35,80,142,50,144,1,48,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
