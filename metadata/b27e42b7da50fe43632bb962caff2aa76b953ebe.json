The result is a boiling pot of American\ncultures; a wonderfully fresh and quirky kind of pop music that combines delta-meets-appalachia song-writing with a big, big beat.\n\nEven though the songs were birthed in the hills and country towns of old America, \ndonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t call it old-timey; LaFarge is here to grace it into this modern and electric world.Along with his refreshing take on tradition, Pokey brings his irresistible charm and genuinely romantic outlook on, not only subjects such as the rivers and the land itself, but universal topics such as love, death, and real adventure. With a firm grasp on personal freedom and Shakespearean insight on humanity, Pokey remains one of the veryfew folks who consistently turn the abstract into a concrete reality.\n\nMusic is not just chords and notes and melody. To a person who truly loves music, it is a medium to celebrate this life. For Pokey, every show is a celebration juke-joint style ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ where women twirl in their dresses and the fellas stomp their feet and clap their hands. To this day, Mr. LaFarge is still finding tranquility within the yellow highway lines playing up to two-hundred shows a year bringing his music to anyone young and old who is willing to listen.\n\nBlue Grass, Blues.  \n\n Pokey LaFarge &amp; The South City Three - Riverboat Soul (2010)  MP3 VBR\n\n 1 La La Blues\n 2 Claude Jones\n 3 WonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Make Love at All\n 4 Hard Times Come And Go\n 5 Two-Faced Tom\n 6 You DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Want Me\n 7 Sweet Potato Blues\n 8 Bag of Bones\n 9 In the Graveyard Now\n 10 Migraines and Heartpains\n 11 Old Black Dog\n 12 Daffodil Blues","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b27e42b7da50fe43632bb962caff2aa76b953ebe","amp;dn":"Pokey+LaFarge+%26amp%3B+The+South+City+Three+-+Riverboat+Soul+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b27e42b7da50fe43632bb962caff2aa76b953ebe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,126,66,183,218,80,254,67,99,43,185,98,202,255,42,167,107,149,62,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
