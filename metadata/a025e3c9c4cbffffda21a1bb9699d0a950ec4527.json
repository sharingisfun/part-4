Through filming incredible and historic spiritual encounters around the world, Darren Wilson cuts through religious misconceptions in an effort to find the true nature and character of God. If God could be filmed, what would He look like? In this explosive documentary, filmmaker Darren Wilson attempts to do the impossible: film God and understand His character. Along the way, Darren and his team encounter powerful witch doctors, violent gang leaders, Hindu holy men, and everyday people with extraordinary experiences to tell. Father of Lights attempts to peel back the many layers of religious garbage that has been passed onto him through generations, and reveals a God who is far better than anyone could have possibly imagined. Prepare to see the impossible. Prepare to meet your Maker. \n\nRuntime: 98 mins\nLanguage: English\nYear: 2012\nQuality: 9/10 \nFormat: avi format \n\nSee reviews here,  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon(dot)com/Father-Lights-Darren-Wilson/dp/B009ISQ3DI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon(dot)com/Father-Lights-Darren-Wilson/dp/B009ISQ3DI&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&quot;Don't ask me what Christ can do for you!
