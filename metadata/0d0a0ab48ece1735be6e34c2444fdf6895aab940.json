During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis &quot;Red&quot; Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation.\n\nDespite a lukewarm box office reception that was barely enough to cover its budget, the film received favorable reviews from critics, multiple award nominations, and has since enjoyed a remarkable life on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray, even being included in the American Film Institute's 100 YearsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦100 Movies 10th Anniversary Edition.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d0a0ab48ece1735be6e34c2444fdf6895aab940","amp;dn":"The+Shawshank+Redemption+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d0a0ab48ece1735be6e34c2444fdf6895aab940","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,10,10,180,142,206,23,53,190,110,52,194,68,79,223,104,149,170,185,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
