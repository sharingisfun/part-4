Only from MAE_INT.\n\n- About mp3HD -\n\nmp3HD is a new scalable format for high-quality lossless compression\nof audio signals. It guarantees bit-exact reproduction of the\noriginal PCM samples at state-of-the-art compression ratios. As for\nall lossless compression formats, the compression ratio and resulting\ndata rate depends on the compressed content. As a rule of thumb, the\nmp3HD codec can compress WAV files to about 30% to 60% of their\noriginal size for typical audio content. Typically, smaller data\nrates are needed to encode classical music or audio books, while Rock\nand Pop music requires larger data rates.\n\nmp3HD has been designed with the explicit target to be as compatible\nas possible to the ubiquitous MP3 format. As a consequence, the mp3HD\nformat uses advanced compression algorithms and a special bit stream\nformat in order to be compatible to most of the available MP3 players.\nTherefore mp3HD is both a lossless format for the reproduction of the\noriginal PCM samples and a standard MP3 file that play's on your MP3\nplayer.\n\nThe mp3HD Format supports tagging the files with meta data according\nto ID3 Version 1.0, 1.1, 2.3 and 2.4. That is, you can use many\nexisting tools to add ID3 tags to your mp3HD content, and to manage\nand organize your audio collection.\n\nFor more info check www.all4mp3.com or google for mp3HD. Enjoy !\n\n- We are doing this for fun !\n- If you leech a track / album and like it go and buy it !\n- Support the music industry !\n\n&lt;MAE_INT&gt;&lt;2010&gt;&lt;OSTZ&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cec64f64e88053e1269cb9788a315cd30ea73cd","amp;dn":"Ice_Cube-Greatest_Hits-2001-mp3HD-MAE_INT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cec64f64e88053e1269cb9788a315cd30ea73cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,236,100,246,78,136,5,62,18,105,203,151,136,163,21,205,48,234,115,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
