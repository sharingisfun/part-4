Her unnamed Middle Eastern country caught up in an insurrection, the loyal, thirtysomething wife faithfully sits watch over her vegetative husband, who has been all but forgotten by his brothers and fellow Jihadists. Over time, she gathers the courage to tell her husband all of the things she had remained silent about during their 10 years of marriage. Throughout the course of these missives, she speaks frankly of the disappointments, sorrows, and sacrifices that have made her life so difficult throughout the previous decade. Only weeks later, when the isolated wife enters into a relationship with a young soldier, does she begin to reveal the woman who she had kept locked up deep inside ever since the day she was married. \n\n\n\nLanguage: Persian\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / French","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14c99dc764a413d445a046a8017e9f777e51637f","amp;dn":"The+Patience+Stone+2012+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14c99dc764a413d445a046a8017e9f777e51637f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,201,157,199,100,164,19,212,69,160,70,168,1,126,159,119,126,81,99,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
