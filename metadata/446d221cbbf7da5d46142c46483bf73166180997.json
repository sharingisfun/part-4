Today he is Samuel Hunter, a successful Santa Barbara insurance salesman with a Mercedes, a condo, and a hollow, invented life. Then one day, destiny offers him the dangerous gift of love -- in the exquisite form of Calliope Kincaid -- and a curse in the unheralded appearance of an ancient god by the name of Coyote. Coyote, the trickster, has arrived to reawaken the mystical storyteller within Sam...and to seriously screw up his existence in the process.\n\nA Dirty Job\nCharlie Asher is a pretty normal guy. A little hapless, somewhat neurotic, sort of a hypochondriac. He's what's known as a Beta Male: the kind of fellow who makes his way through life by being careful and constant -- you know, the one who's always there to pick up the pieces when the girl gets dumped by the bigger/taller/stronger Alpha Male.\nBut Charlie's been lucky. He owns a building in the heart of San Francisco, and runs a secondhand store with the help of a couple of loyal, if marginally insane, employees. He's married to a bright and pretty woman who actually loves him for his normalcy. And she, Rachel, is about to have their first child.\nYes, Charlie's doing okay for a Beta. That is, until the day his daughter, Sophie, is born. Just as Charlie -- exhausted from the birth -- turns to go home, he sees a strange man in mint-green golf wear at Rachel's hospital bedside, a man who claims that no one should be able to see him. But see him Charlie does, and from here on out, things get really weird...\n\nFluke: Or, I Know Why the Winged Whale Sings\nJust why do humpback whales sing? That's the question that has marine behavioral biologist Nate Quinn and his crew poking, charting, recording, and photographing very big, wet, gray marine mammals. Until the extraordinary day when a whale lifts its tail into the air to display a cryptic message spelled out in foot-high letters: Bite me.\nTrouble is, Nate's beginning to wonder if he hasn't spent just a little too much time in the sun. 'Cause no one else on his team saw a thing - not his longtime partner, Clay Demodocus; not their saucy young research assistant; not even the spliff-puffing white-boy Rastaman Kona ( Preston Applebaum). But later, when a roll of film returns from the lab missing the crucial tail shot - and his research facility is trashed - Nate realizes something very fishy indeed is going on.\n\nFool\nA man of infinite jest, Pocket has been Lear's cherished fool for years, from the time the king's grown daughtersÃ¢â‚¬â€selfish, scheming Goneril, sadistic (but erotic-fantasy-grade-hot) Regan, and sweet, loyal CordeliaÃ¢â‚¬â€were mere girls. So naturally Pocket is at his brainless, elderly liege's side when LearÃ¢â‚¬â€at the insidious urging of Edmund, the bastard (in every way imaginable) son of the Earl of GloucesterÃ¢â‚¬â€demands that his kids swear their undying love and devotion before a collection of assembled guests. Of course Goneril and Regan are only too happy to brownnose Dad. But Cordelia believes that her father's request is kind of . . . well . . . stupid, and her blunt honesty ends up costing her her rightful share of the kingdom and earns her a banishment to boot.\n\nIsland of the Sequined Love Nun\nTucker Case is a defrocked pilot for the Mary Jean Cosmetics Corporation who lost his job, totaled his boss' plane, and nearly demolished his manhood during a drunken airborne sexual liaison. Now he is running for his life from Mary Jean's goons toward the only employment opportunity left for him: piloting shady secret missions for an unscrupulous medical missionary and a sexy, naturally blond High Priestess on a remote Micronesian island hell, whose one-time cannibalistic residents have not completely abandoned their culinary past.\n\nLamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal\nThe birth of Jesus has been well chronicled, as have his glorious teachings, acts, and divine sacrifice after his thirtieth birthday. But no one knows about the early life of the Son of God, the missing years Ã¢â‚¬â€ except Biff, the Messiah's best bud, who has been resurrected to tell the story in the divinely hilarious yet heartfelt work &quot;reminiscent of Vonnegut and Douglas Adams&quot; (Philadelphia Inquirer).\nVerily, the story Biff has to tell is a miraculous one, filled with remarkable journeys, magic, healings, kung fu, corpse reanimations, demons, and hot babes. Even the considerable wiles and devotion of the Savior's pal may not be enough to divert Joshua from his tragic destiny. But there's no one who loves Josh more Ã¢â‚¬â€ except maybe &quot;Maggie,&quot; Mary of Magdala Ã¢â‚¬â€ and Biff isn't about to let his extraordinary pal suffer and ascend without a fight.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:446d221cbbf7da5d46142c46483bf73166180997","amp;dn":"Six+Novels+by+Christopher+Moore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"446d221cbbf7da5d46142c46483bf73166180997","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,109,34,28,187,247,218,93,70,20,44,70,72,59,247,49,102,24,9,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
