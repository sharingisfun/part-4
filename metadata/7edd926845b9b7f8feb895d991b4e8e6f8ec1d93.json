All tracks have been digitally remastered. One of Rhino's exemplary two-disc compilations produced during the early '90s, featuring remastered sound, copious liner notes and more than enough rarities, ANTHOLOGY 1965-'72 is probably the best available (Young) Rascals anthology. All of the hits are here, of course--&quot;Good Lovin',&quot; &quot;How Can I Be Sure,&quot; &quot;Groovin',&quot; etc.--but this collection also gathers goodies like early rave-up R&amp;B covers, unappreciated album tracks and unsuccessful but often fascinating singles from the group's later years, when they'd added jazz and psychedelia to their original blue-eyed soul sound. At 44 tracks, these two discs are jam-packed, and both fans and newcomers will be pleased. Wisely, Rhino used the superior original mono mixes whenever available, making this one of the few Rascals anthologies with no fake stereo\n\n\n\nEntertainment Weekly (8/21/92, p.62) - &quot;...a flavorful potpourri of jazz, soul, psychedelic-pop, and gospel, boasting a fair measure of overlooked delights that reflect the Rascals' unwavering taste and invention...&quot; - Rating: B+ Stereo Review (12/92, p.106) - &quot;...most of this set is flat-out great...\n\n\n\nSong Title\nDISC 1:\n1.I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore\n2.Good Lovin'\n3.Do You Feel It - (bonus track)\n4.Mustang Sally\n5.Baby Let's Wait - (bonus track)\n6.In The Midnight Hour - (bonus track)\n7.You Better Run\n8.What Is The Reason\n9.I've Been Lonely Too Long\n10.Come On Up\n11.Too Many Fish In The Sea - (bonus track)\n12.Love Is A Beautiful Thing\n13.Groovin'\n14.A Girl Like You \n15.Find Somebody - (bonus track)\n16.How Can I Be Sure\n17.If You Knew - (bonus track)\n18.I'm So Happy Now - (bonus track)\n19.Easy Rollin'\n20.Rainy Day\n21.It's Wonderful\n22.Silly Girl\n23.Finale: Once Upon A Dream - (bonus track)\n24.A Beautiful Morning \n\nDISC 2:\n1.People Got To Be Free\n2.Island Of Love - (bonus track)\n3.Look Around - (bonus track)\n4.A Ray Of Hope \n5.Heaven\n6.See\n7.I'd Like To Take You Home\n8.Temptation's `Bout To Get Me\n9.Nubia - (bonus track)\n10.Real Thing\n11.Carry Me Back\n12.Right On - (bonus track)\n13.Ready For Love\n14.I Believe - (bonus track)\n15.Glory Glory\n16.Love Me\n17.Happy Song - (bonus track)\n18.Lucky Day\n19.Saga Of New York - (bonus track)\n20.Brother Tree\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7edd926845b9b7f8feb895d991b4e8e6f8ec1d93","amp;dn":"The+%28Young%29+Rascals+Anthology+1965+-+1972+%28Rhino+1992%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7edd926845b9b7f8feb895d991b4e8e6f8ec1d93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,221,146,104,69,185,183,248,254,184,149,217,145,180,232,230,248,236,29,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
