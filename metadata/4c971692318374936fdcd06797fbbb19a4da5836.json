The concepts of static fields, time varying fields, wave propagation, transmission lines, and radiation are described. Most importantly, the text emphasizes the use of MATLAB, which is now widely available and has frequently been used by most students in previous courses, for the calculation and visualization of the electromagnetic field characteristics in these areas.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c971692318374936fdcd06797fbbb19a4da5836","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Electromagnetics+with+Matlab%2C+Prelimenary+Editio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c971692318374936fdcd06797fbbb19a4da5836","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,151,22,146,49,131,116,147,111,220,208,103,151,251,187,25,164,218,88,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
