Feynman recounts in his inimitable voice his adventures trading ideas on atomic physics with Einstein and Bohr and ideas on gambling with Nick the Greek, painting a naked female toreador, accompanying a ballet on his bongo drums and much else of an eyebrow-raising and hilarious nature.\n\nHistory will remember Nobel PrizeÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinning physicist Feynman (1918Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1988), for his work in quantum physics and his role in the investigation of the explosion of the Challenger space shuttle. Contemporary readers and listeners, however, will remember him best for his reputation as a free-thinking iconoclast whose personal adventures were hilarious, insightful and inspiring. Todd does a fabulous job of conveying Feynman's infectious enthusiasm and childlike sense of wonder with his energetic portrayal of the scientist. He's adept even in difficult sections, such as when Feynman &quot;speaks Italian&quot; and &quot;Chinese&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€inventing completely made-up but accurate sounding languages. Todd does a good job of portraying Feynman's inquisitive manner and conveys the book's message and attitude with aplomb. While he sounds nothing like the late physicist (FeynmanÃ¢â‚¬â€ the subject of James Gleick's GeniusÃ¢â‚¬â€had a thick Long Island accent and sounded more like a cross between Yogi Bear and The Honeymooners' Ed Norton), Todd's clean, polite voice is a revelation.\n\nA New York Times bestseller; more than 500,000 copies sold, black-and-white photographs throughout.\nGenre: Non-Fiction, Memoirs, Humour","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76a5581bf7d56a6ef7b18d8c218015d892c3a621","amp;dn":"_Surely+You%27re+Joking%2C+Mr.+Feynman%21__+Ad+-+Richard+P.+Feynman.ep","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76a5581bf7d56a6ef7b18d8c218015d892c3a621","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,165,88,27,247,213,106,110,247,177,141,140,33,128,21,216,146,195,166,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
