Mollie Gross learned the hard way to laugh instead of cry at what she could not control as a military spouse?and as she quickly discovered, nearly everything was out of her control!\r\nA standup comedienne, public speaker, and wife of a Marine Corps officer, Mollie explores everything about the â€œissuedâ€ spouse, from deployment and the stress of having a husband in a combat zone, to the realization that marriage changes when your husband returns home from war. Nothing is taboo or out-of-bounds in Confessions, including the â€œpartiesâ€ military wives throw for themselves before hubby returns. (Youâ€™ll have to read the book to find out about those!)\r\nUpdated, expanded, and now in paperback, Confessions is a canâ€™t-put-down book that will leave you laughing and crying at the same time.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nMollie Gross is a professional stand-up comedienne, motivational speaker, and the wife of a USMC Iraq War veteran. She teaches audiences to â€œHandle it with Humorâ€? to learn how to laugh through lifeâ€™s toughest challenges.
