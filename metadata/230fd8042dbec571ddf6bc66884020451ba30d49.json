The very latest methods are incorporated in this edition: semi-supervised learning, combining clustering algorithms, and relevance feedback.\n\nThoroughly developed to include many more worked examples to give greater understanding of the various methods and techniques. Many more diagrams included--now in two-colors--to provide greater insight through visual presentation . Matlab code of the most common methods are given at the end of each chapter.\n\n\nLatest hot topics included to further the reference value of the text including non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques, relevance feedback, semi-supervised learning, spectral clustering, combining clustering algorithms. \n\n\nSolutions manual, powerpoint slides, and additional resources are available to faculty using the text for their course.
