They met in grade school in 1953, when they both appeared in the school play Alice in Wonderland (Simon as the White Rabbit, Garfunkel as The Cheshire Cat). They formed the group Tom and Jerry in 1957, and had their first taste of success with the minor hit &quot;Hey Schoolgirl.&quot; As Simon and Garfunkel, the duo rose to fame in 1965 backed by the hit single &quot;The Sound of Silence.&quot; Their music was featured on the landmark film, The Graduate, propelling them further into the public consciousness. They are well known for their close harmonies and sometimes unstable relationship. Their last album, Bridge Over Troubled Water, was marked with several delays caused by artistic differences. Simon and Garfunkel were among the most popular recording artists of the 1960s, and are best known for their songs &quot;The Sound of Silence,&quot; &quot;Mrs. Robinson,&quot; and &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water.&quot;\n\nThey have received several Grammys and are inductees of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Long Island Music Hall of Fame (2007). In 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked Simon and Garfunkel[1] #40 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. They have reunited on several occasions since their 1970 break-up, most famously for 1981&amp;#039;s The Concert in Central Park, which attracted 500,000 people.\n\nSimon and Garfunkel first released a Greatest Hits album on 14 June 1972, covering their heyday of 1965?1970. It peaked on the US charts at #5. In the UK, it was a #2 hit. The album, a unique mix of original hits and live recordings of hits, has proven a long and durable seller, currently being certified for 14 million units sold in the US alone. In 2003, the album was ranked number 293 on Rolling Stone magazine&amp;#039;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nTrack listing\n&quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; ? 3:51 \n&quot;For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her&quot; ? 2:25 \n&quot;The Boxer&quot; ? 5:08 \n&quot;The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin&amp;#039; Groovy)&quot; ? 1:50 \n&quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; ? 3:04 \n&quot;I Am a Rock&quot; ? 2:50 \n&quot;Scarborough Fair/Canticle&quot; ? 3:09 \n&quot;Homeward Bound&quot; ? 2:42 \n&quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; ? 4:51 \n&quot;America&quot; ? 3:33 \n&quot;Kathy&amp;#039;s Song&quot; ? 3:22 \n&quot;El Condor Pasa (If I Could)&quot; ? 3:07 \n&quot;Bookends&quot; ? 1:19 \n&quot;Cecilia&quot; ? 2:53 \n\n\nReleased June, 1972 \nRecorded March 1964 ?
