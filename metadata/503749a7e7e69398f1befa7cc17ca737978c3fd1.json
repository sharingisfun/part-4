Includes essential tracks from The Hollies, CSNY, Crosby/Nash, Nash solo and more! This deluxe package features a 150 page booklet with 75 classic and unseen photos and track notes by Graham Nash. Arranged chronologically, Reflections spans Nash's recordings from 1967 to 2007, starting with a trio of singles he released with The Hollies in 1967: 'On A Carousel', 'Carrie Anne', and 'King Midas In Reverse.' Nash left the group a year later, joining with Crosby and Stills to record the trio's self-titled album, which earned them the Grammy for Best New Artist. Reflections gathers several songs from that album-and its follow-up, released a few months later with the addition of Young-including 'Pre-Road Downs,' 'Marrakesh Express,' 'Our House' and 'Teach Your Children.' The set also includes tracks from the group's other albums: 'Just A Song Before I Go,' 'Wasted On My Way' and 'Heartland.' Over the years, Crosby and Nash have recorded a number of albums as a duo. Reflections features several gems from those collaborations with 'Immigration Man,' 'To The Last Whale,' 'Jesus Of Rio' and more. The collection also brings together several classics from Nash's four solo albums, ranging from the politically-charged 'Military Madness' and 'Chicago/We Can Change The World' to the emotionally raw 'Simple Man' and 'Sleep Song' and the socially conscious 'Barrel Of Pain' and 'Chippin' Away.' Reflection spotlights 32 songs with different mixes and alternate versions that have never been released. Among the highlights is Nash's solo acoustic demo of 'Right Between The Eyes.' Recorded during the Deja Vu session, a live version of the track popped up in 1971 on a CSN&amp;Y live album. The compilation contains six unreleased tracks, including 'Water From The Moon,' 'Try To Find Me' and 'In Your Name,' a song he recorded in 2007.\n\nCountry: England\nGenre: Folk / Folk-Rock\nQuality: 320 kbps\nTracklist:\n\n(2009) Graham Nash - Reflections (The Definitive Collection)\n\nDISC 1\n01 - On a Carousel (Mono).mp3\n02 - Carrie Anne (Mono).mp3\n03 - King Midas in Reverse (Mono).mp3\n04 - Marrakesh Express.mp3\n05 - Pre-Road Downs.mp3\n06 - Lady of the Island.mp3\n07 - Our House.mp3\n08 - Teach Your Children.mp3\n09 - Right Between the Eyes.mp3\n10 - I Used to Be a King.mp3\n11 - Simple Man.mp3\n12 - Man in the Mirror.mp3\n13 - Better Days.mp3\n14 - Military Madness.mp3\n15 - Sleep Song.mp3\n16 - ChicagoWe Can Change the World.mp3\n17 - Southbound Train.mp3\n18 - Immigration Man.mp3\n19 - Wild Tales.mp3\n20 - Prison Song.mp3\n21 - Oh!
