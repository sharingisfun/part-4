ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why the book is filled with tips for how to avoid the usual food pitfalls like holidays, eating out, or even just a tempting candy jar. Along with a comprehensive explanation of how each segment works, every phase comes with an extensive list of foods, recipes, and sample meal plans to help make grocery shopping a breeze. Because of the diversity that you are allowed from the very beginning of the program, there is a way to make this diet work with almost any food allergies you might have or what cuisine youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re used to eating.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:762215574c24ec78bc6385fc0abfa63cedea64b2","amp;dn":"The+17+Day+Diet+-+Dr.+Mike+Moreno","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"762215574c24ec78bc6385fc0abfa63cedea64b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,34,21,87,76,36,236,120,188,99,133,252,10,191,166,60,237,234,100,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
