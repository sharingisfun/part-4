But until now, there has been no real manual on how to use Python for a variety of hacking tasks. You had to dig through forum posts and man pages, endlessly tweaking your own code to get everything working. Not anymore.\n\nGray Hat Python explains the concepts behind hacking tools and techniques like debuggers, trojans, fuzzers, and emulators. But author Justin Seitz goes beyond theory, showing you how to harness existing Python-based security tools - and how to build your own when the pre-built ones won't cut it.\n\nYou'll learn how to:\n\nAutomate tedious reversing and security tasks\nDesign and program your own debugger\nLearn how to fuzz Windows drivers and create powerful fuzzers from scratch\nHave fun with code and library injection, soft and hard hooking techniques, and other software trickery\nSniff secure traffic out of an encrypted web browser session\nUse PyDBG, Immunity Debugger, Sulley, IDAPython, PyEMU, and more\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f0880eaea471b17b76936b361813571f58ee0cb","amp;dn":"Gray+Hat+Python+-+Python+Programming+for+Hackers+and+Reverse+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f0880eaea471b17b76936b361813571f58ee0cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,8,128,234,234,71,27,23,183,105,54,179,97,129,53,113,245,142,224,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
