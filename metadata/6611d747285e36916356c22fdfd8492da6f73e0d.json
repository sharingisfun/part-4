Unfortunately, it was in WAVE files and untagged, so converted it to 320 Kbps, 48 000 Hz, and added proper tagging, so it wouldn't mess up anyone's libraries.\n\nFirst time I've uploaded a torrent, so let me know if there's something I can do better or such. Otherwise, enjoy, and I'll be seeding it for as long as I can.\n\nThe music of Dragon Age Inquisition explores a modern take on the fantasy \ngenre, blending organic sounds and textures with orchestra and solo \ninstruments, traditional and eclectic. With world-class strings, brass, and \nchoir recorded at Nashville's Ocean Way Studio A inside a 100-year-old Gothic \nrevival church, and featuring a specific array of soloists on cello, electric \ncello, and guitarviol among others, the score aims not to overshadow the story \nbut to become part of it through the human connection these musicians bring. \nFrom epic cinematic battles to choral folk tunes to more ambient and layered \npieces, the music of DA:I is a reflection of its environment, inspired by the \ncolor and grandeur of Thedas, and the Inquisition's themes, creatures, \ncharacters, and world.\n\n\nTracks:\n01-Dragon Age Inquisition Theme\n02-Escape From the Fade\n03-The Wrath of Heaven\n04-Calling the Inquisition\n05-Champions of the Just\n06-Lord Seeker\n07-In Hushed Whispers\n08-Sacrifice\n09-Alexius\n10-In Your Heart Shall Burn\n11-The Dawn Will Come\n12-Journey to Skyhold\n13-The Western Approach\n14-Siege of Adamant\n15-Adamant Fortress\n16-The Fall\n17-The Place of All Fears\n18-Nightmare's End\n19-Val Royeaux\n20-Wicked Eyes and Wicked Hearts\n21-The Inquisition Marches\n22-The Lost Temple\n23-Death on the Bridge\n24-Guardians of the Past\n25-The Well of Sorrows\n26-Call His Wrath\n27-The Lie in Which You Linger\n28-Battle in the Sky\n29-Tooth and Scale\n30-Let the Skies Boil\n31-Doom Upon All The World\n32-Orb of Destruction\n33-The Scar\n34-Return to Skyhold\n35-Epilogue\n36-The Elder One Theme\n37-Orlais Theme\n38-Thedas Love Theme\n39-A World Torn Asunder (Gameplay Trailer)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6611d747285e36916356c22fdfd8492da6f73e0d","amp;dn":"Trevor+Morris+-+%26quot%3BDragon+Age+Inquisition+Original+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6611d747285e36916356c22fdfd8492da6f73e0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,17,215,71,40,94,54,145,99,86,194,47,223,216,73,45,166,247,62,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
