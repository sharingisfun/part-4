His combination of an interest in natural, organic shapes with the modernist mandates of form and light in its purest aspects makes him one of the acknowledged masters of modern architecture, along with Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright. Ada Louise Huxtable writes of Aalto, &quot;his deceptively simple style is a sophisticated synthesis, a reconciliation of the monumental and the popular, of the general and the particular, of the real and the mythic, of nature and art.&quot;\n\nThis book is one of cornerstones of any serious architectural library.\n\nAlvar Aalto, Vol. 1: 1922-1962 - ISBN: 376435500X\nAlvar Aalto, Vol. 2: 1963-1970 - ISBN: 3764355018\nAlvar Aalto, Vol. 3: Projects and Final Buildings (1971-1976) - ISBN: 3764355026","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0eb283aaf4ae627a10f3fd432dabce3485daf544","amp;dn":"Alvar+Aalto+-+The+Complete+Work+3+Vols+%28Architecture+Ebook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0eb283aaf4ae627a10f3fd432dabce3485daf544","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,178,131,170,244,174,98,122,16,243,253,67,45,171,206,52,133,218,245,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
