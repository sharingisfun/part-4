It serves not only as a strong and fitting tribute to one of music's greatest figures, but as a perfect opportunity for Natalie Cole to expand her horizons...and her fan base.\n\nLet's be honest...they just don't write 'em like they used to, and therefore Natalie never had quite the chance to show off the grace and elegance of her voice as she does on the likes of &quot;The Very Thought of You,&quot; &quot;Mona Lisa,&quot; and &quot;Our Love is Here to Stay.&quot; Producers Andre Fischer, Tommy Lipuma, and David Foster keep Natalie in superior arragements throughout, especially evident on &quot;Too Young&quot; and an exquisite rendition of &quot;Lush Life.&quot; There's plenty of swing, too, however: &quot;Paper Moon,&quot; &quot;Route 66,&quot; and &quot;L-O-V-E&quot; are songs that couldn't be authentically pulled off by just any pop singer, but Natalie more than rises to the challenge. Furthermore the frantically-paced &quot;Avalon&quot; and the midtempo &quot;Don't Get Around Much Anymore,&quot; the latter boasting a slick scat, are among the album's best tracks.\n\nBut the finest moment comes at the finale: through the wonders of modern technology, Natalie is afforded the opportunity to sing with her father, digitally remastered here to gorgeous effect on the album's title track. Unfortunately, the practice inspired countless, less-appropriate knock-offs (even Natalie reprised the idea two albums later with far less impact) but here, Natalie's obvious love and affection for her father and his music come through tenfold, and we're treated to one of the most beautiful and moving moments in jazz. In summation, a talented daughter pays tribute to her legendary father, singing timeless classics admist top-notch arrangements traditional enough for purists to admire, but accessible enough for pop fans to discover and cherish. &quot;Unforgettable&quot; indeed.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n               Natalie Cole - Unforgettable: With Love\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Natalie Cole\nAlbum................: Unforgettable: With Love\nGenre................: R&amp;B\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1991\n\nFLAC\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 58 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 252kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
