Why Her?: Understanding Your Personality Type and Finding the Perfect Match \n\n\nMacmillan Audio\nHelen Fisher\n2009 \nENGLISH\nISBN: 1427206279 \nMP3 \n30 KBPS\n7 Hrs 50 Mins 53 Sec\n102 MB\n\nA groundbreaking book about how your personality type determines who you love.\n\nWhy do you fall in love with one person rather than another? In this fascinating and informative book, Helen Fisher, one of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leading experts on romantic love, unlocks the hidden code of desire and attachment. Each of us, it turns out, primarily expresses one of four broad personality typesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Explorer, Builder, Director, or NegotiatorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and each of these types is governed by different chemical systems in the brain. Driven by this biology, we are attracted to partners who both mirror and complement our own personality type.\n\nUntil now the search for love has been blind, but Fisher pulls back the curtain and reveals how we unconsciously go about finding the right match. Drawing on her unique study of 40,000 men and women, she explores each personality type in detail and shows you how to identify your own type. Then she explains why some types match up well, whereas others are problematic. (Note to Explorers: be prepared for a wild ride when you hitch your star to a fellow Explorer!) Ultimately, FisherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s investigation into the complex nature of romance and attachment leads to astonishing new insights into the essence of dating, love, and marriage.\n\nBased on entirely new researchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including a detailed questionnaire completed by five million people in thirty-three countriesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Why Him? Why Her? will change your understanding of why you love him (or her) and help you use natureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s chemistry to find and keep your life partner.\n\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e09561e2b44ca489288b0f54fabd244d48a17b4","amp;dn":"Why+Him%3F+Why+Her%3F%3A+Understanding+Your+Personality+Type+and+Findi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e09561e2b44ca489288b0f54fabd244d48a17b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,9,86,30,43,68,202,72,146,136,176,245,79,171,210,68,212,138,23,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
