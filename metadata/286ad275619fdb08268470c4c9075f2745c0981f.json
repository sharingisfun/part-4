People may know how to sell, but most were never taught how to persuade. Persuasion expert Dave Lakhani breaks down the process into easy-to-use steps, teaching the listener hot only how to persuade, but the biology and phychology behind it as well.\n\nPersuasion is key to every aspect of sales, marketing and negotiations. This audiobook reveals today's most effective persuasion techniques for business professionals, which can easily be applied to their personal lives as well.\n\nAlthough the techniques are similar, Lakhani draws a hard line between persuasion and manipulation, with the primary distinction being intent. True persuasion is based in truth, honest and inquisitiveness, and the ability to tell a powerful story and to meet the expectations of those one is trying to persuade. Good persuasion is a practiced art.\n\n128kbps\n44Hz\n\n5 Hours\n10 track approximately 30 minutes each\n\nMP3 format\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:286ad275619fdb08268470c4c9075f2745c0981f","amp;dn":"Dave+Lakhani-Persuasion-The+Art+of+Getting+What+You+Want","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"286ad275619fdb08268470c4c9075f2745c0981f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,106,210,117,97,159,219,8,38,132,112,196,201,7,95,39,69,192,152,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
