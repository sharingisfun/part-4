Its 1978 debut album, Van HalenÃ¢â‚¬â€featuring guitarist Eddie Van Halen, vocalist David Lee Roth, drummer Alex Van Halen, and bassist Michael AnthonyÃ¢â‚¬â€is widely considered to be among the most &quot;original&quot; and &quot;revolutionary&quot; albums to &quot;change rock and roll.&quot;\n\nAccording to the Recording Industry Association of America, Van Halen is the 19th best-selling band/artist in United States history, with sales of over 56 million albums in the U.S. and over 86 million albums worldwide, (with the band's former record company, Warner Bros. Records, last certifying Van Halen's albums in 2004.) Van Halen is one of only five rock bands that have had two albums sell more than 10 million copies in the U.S. Additionally, Van Halen has had the most #1 hits in the history of Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart.\n\nIn addition to Van Halen's many popular songs, the band is known for the drama surrounding the exits of former members. The multiple exits of lead singers David Lee Roth, Sammy Hagar and Gary Cherone were surrounded in controversy and press coverage, including numerous conflicting press statements between the former singers and the band. Following their 2004 concert tour the band was on a hiatus from the public until September 2006, when new bassist Wolfgang Van Halen's place was confirmed and Roth reunion rumors began to re-surface, both events coinciding with the band's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction on March 12, 2007. After years of speculation, Van Halen began a tour with Roth across North America in 2007 and into 2008. On December 26, 2011, Van Halen announced a tour for 2012, and released their first album in 14 years, A Different Kind of Truth, on February 7, 2012.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c8f3e16a6d798fcf898ec785338cbb01a024f35","amp;dn":"Van+Halen+-+Best+Of+Volume+1+%5B1996%5D%5B320+KBPS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c8f3e16a6d798fcf898ec785338cbb01a024f35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,143,62,22,166,215,152,252,248,152,236,120,83,56,203,176,26,2,79,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
