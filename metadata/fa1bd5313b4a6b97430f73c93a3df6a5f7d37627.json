Through it all, life has been found in almost every system we visited and yet we've never encountered another intelligent species.\nUntil now.\nWhen the Colony on the planet known as Hayden's World stops transmitting on their CASIMIR FTL system, a Solari Fleet Task Force is sent to investigate. When they arrive there are enough oddities in the situation that they in turn send in a special operations unit to contact the colonists and determine what happened.\nOnly one of those operators survives to make planet fall.\nSergeant Sorilla Aida finds herself against an alien force of unknown power and capability. Her only assets? A depleted suit of power armor, her rifle, basic kit, and a few hundred Hayden born civilians looking to take back their home.\nJust what she was trained for.\n\n---\n\nValkyrie Rising (Hayden War Cycle #2)\n\nTwo years after the initial invasion of Hayden's World, the newly reinforced Hayden Militia is in a state of stalemate with the remaining enemy forces but neither side is content to leave things at that.\n\nThe alien alliance has dispatched their varsity to clean up the resistance on Hayden while the USF has officially activated Task Force V, the latest and most advanced combat ships built by humans.\n\nIn the end there are some things you decide in the skies, but some can only be settled in the mud.\n\n\n\nRead by Dina Pearlman\nFormat: M4A\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa1bd5313b4a6b97430f73c93a3df6a5f7d37627","amp;dn":"Evan+C.+Currie+-+Hayden+War+Cycle+%5BBooks+1+%26amp%3B+2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa1bd5313b4a6b97430f73c93a3df6a5f7d37627","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,27,213,49,59,74,107,151,67,15,115,201,58,61,246,165,247,211,118,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
