Chelsea have never won at St James' Park in the league under Jose Mourinho, and their previous two visits have ended in defeat. Elsewhere, Arsenal take on a Stoke team who have a fantastic record over Arsene Wenger's side at the Britannia Stadium, with just one defeat in the Premier League. Plus a London derby between Tottenham and Crystal Palace, while the champions Manchester City host Everton in the evening kick-off. Early-season strugglers QPR and Burnley meet at Loftus Road, Hull are at home to West Brom and Liverpool host Sunderland.
