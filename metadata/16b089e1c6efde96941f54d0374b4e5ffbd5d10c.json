The band caused a stir when they - out of nowhere - toured as support for Suffocation on their European tour in 2006 and when they independently released their debut album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRetributionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that same year.\n\nIn late 2007 - after several line-up changes - Obscura announced drummer Hannes Grossmann (ex-Necrophagist) and fretless bass player Jeroen Paul Thesseling (ex-Pestilence) as new permanent members. In early 2008 the new line-up was completed with the addition of Christian Muenzner (ex-Necrophagist) as permanent guitarist.\n\nObscura released its second full-length album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCosmogenesisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (feat. special guest appearances by Ron Jarzombek [Watchtower, Blotted Science] and Tymon Kruidenier [Cynic, Exivious]) in early 2009 via Relapse Records. Re(de)fining their approach, Obscura continue to create their vision of the future of extreme metal - a symbiosis of death, thrash and black metal merged with progressive elements and technical as well as compositional demand.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16b089e1c6efde96941f54d0374b4e5ffbd5d10c","amp;dn":"Obscura+-+Discography+%282006+-+2011%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16b089e1c6efde96941f54d0374b4e5ffbd5d10c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,176,137,225,198,239,222,150,148,31,84,208,55,75,78,95,251,213,209,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
