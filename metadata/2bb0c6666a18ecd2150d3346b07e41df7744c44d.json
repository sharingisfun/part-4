The bride's brother, in a shocking display, exposes the groom's motives during his wedding toast and threatens his new brother-in-law with death if he disappoints his sister. But Nishi is not who we think. He was born the illegitimate son of the man who Kieko's father, Iwabuchi (Maysayuki Mori), manipulated into suicide. Now Nishi wants revenge for his father's death. As Nishi slowly destroys Iwabuchi's life, he makes the fatal error of falling in love with his wife, who already loves him. Their unconsummated marriage stands between these two like a palpable pillar of stone. But just when we think the stone has been tossed aside by love, Iwabuchi finds out who his son-in-law really is.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Warui yatsu hodo yoku nemuru.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 2,073,747,456 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 2:31:01\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 696x296 (AR: 2.351)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1629 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.330 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [1 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054460/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054460/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: Japanese\nSubtitles: English, French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese (srt)\n\nMy rip of the Criterion DVD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bb0c6666a18ecd2150d3346b07e41df7744c44d","amp;dn":"Warui+yatsu+hodo+yoku+nemuru+%5BThe+Bad+Sleep+Well%5D+%28Kurosawa%2C+196","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bb0c6666a18ecd2150d3346b07e41df7744c44d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,176,198,102,106,24,236,210,21,13,51,70,176,126,65,223,119,68,196,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
