A tight set that flows effortlessly and showcases the group's strengths in the best possible light. Everything is delivered with an energy and intensity that would be impossible to capture in a studio. One of Foghat's finest albums because it cherry picks all the highlights of the band's catalog to that point, a gem of 1970s hard rock.\n\nTracklist / CD 1:\n\n1\tFool For The City\t\n2\tHome In My Hand\t\n3\tI Just Want To Make Love To You\t\n4\tRoad Fever\t\n5\tHoney Hush\t\n6\tSlow Ride\t\n\nRecorded live at the War Memorial, Rochester, NY, 1977\n\n\n\nCD 2 / King Buiscuit Flower Hour: Foghat in Concert 1974 / 76:\n\nRecorded in 1976, with bonus tracks taken from a 1974 concert, King Biscuit Flower Hour: In Concert is quite possibly the best live Foghat album on the market - it boasts better sound quality and lengthier jams than the Foghat Live album from 1977. An awesome show, and the band is on fire.\n\nTracklist / Disc 2:\n\n1. Fool For The City \n2. My Babe \n3. Drivin' Wheel \n4. Honey Hush \n5. Night Shift \n6. Slow Ride \n7.
