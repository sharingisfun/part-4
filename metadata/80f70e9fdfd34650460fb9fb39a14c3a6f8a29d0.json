Boy, Tricia Yen, Tyffany Million, Vince Voyeur\n\nShock: First, LATEX rocked the world of adult entertainment with its unprecedented visionary style. It swept critics right off their feet - then swept all the major awards. Nothing it seems, could top it. Until SHOCK. Michael Ninn and Antonio Passolini have teamed up again to bring you a cyber-sequel that takes you even deeper into the psyche of their now-famous anti-hero Malcolm Stevens (Jon Dough). Deeper than you may care to go, in fact... It's the story of a quest into the unknown. A quest for truth. For revenge. For meaning in a world where there is none-except insanity. Most of all, it's an erotic tour de force that only Michael Ninn and the creative dreamteam at VCA could device and deliver. Get a glimpse of the future, get SHOCK.\n\nScreens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://xxxhost.me/viewer.php?file=hdxlv8e760n1tjlwvy5b.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://xxxhost.me/viewer.php?file=hdxlv8e760n1tjlwvy5b.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://xxxhost.me/viewer.php?file=c5aiszulgbcm6t0pqd8s.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://xxxhost.me/viewer.php?file=c5aiszulgbcm6t0pqd8s.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80f70e9fdfd34650460fb9fb39a14c3a6f8a29d0","amp;dn":"Michael+Ninn+-+Shock+-+Latex+2+%281996%29+%5BDVDRip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80f70e9fdfd34650460fb9fb39a14c3a6f8a29d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,247,14,159,223,211,70,80,70,15,185,251,57,161,76,58,111,138,41,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
