Ratey, Edward M. Hallowell, &quot;Delivered from Distraction: Getting the Most out of Life with Attention Deficit Disorder&quot;\nEnglish | ISBN: 0345442318 | 2005 | EPUB\n\nIn 1994, Driven to Distraction sparked a revolution in our understanding of attention deficit disorder. Widely recognized as the classic in the field, the book has sold more than a million copies. Now a second revolution is under way in the approach to ADD, and the news is great. Drug therapies, our understanding of the role of diet and exercise, even the way we define the disorderÃ¢â‚¬â€œall are changing radically. And doctors are realizing that millions of adults suffer from this condition, though the vast majority of them remain undiagnosed and untreated. In this new book, Drs. Edward M. Hallowell and John J. Ratey build on the breakthroughs of Driven to Distraction to offer a comprehensive and entirely up-to-date guide to living a successful life with ADD.\n\nAs Hallowell and Ratey point out, Ã¢â‚¬Å“attention deficit disorderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a highly misleading description of an intriguing kind of mind. Original, charismatic, energetic, often brilliant, people with ADD have extraordinary talents and gifts embedded in their highly charged but easily distracted minds. Tailored expressly to ADD learning styles and attention spans, Delivered from Distraction provides accessible, engaging discussions of every aspect of the condition, from diagnosis to finding the proper treatment regime.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23b8eb7983735be5cf0b0e5f7d81405ec4f55352","amp;dn":"Delivered+from+Distraction%3A+Getting+the+Most+out+of+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23b8eb7983735be5cf0b0e5f7d81405ec4f55352","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,184,235,121,131,115,91,229,207,11,14,95,125,129,64,94,196,245,83,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
