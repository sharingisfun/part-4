(Silent Hills)\nPlatform:    PS4/PSN\nGenre:       Horror\nRegion:      EUR / REGION FREE\nLanguage:    English / MULTI\n\n\nThis is the complete P.T. (Silent Hills teaser) game, in .pkg format, that\nhopefully in the future, with some tool/mod/emulator, you'll\nbe able to install directly on your PS4/Play in a emulator.\n\nThough it's not possible to install it right now, there's\na way to install it IF you downloaded the EU ver. of P.T.\nbefore in which you use a program and a proxy to trick\nthe PS4 to downloading the .pkg when trying to redownload\nP.T.\n\nYou can find a tutorial on doing that here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.cheapassgamer.com/topic/341858-how-to-download-games-faster-by-using-your-pc/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.cheapassgamer.com/topic/341858-how-to-download-games-faster-by-using-your-pc/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---\n\n\nSo...it seems that a lot of problems have come\nup at Konami, with the departure of Hideo Kojima and other\nmajor staff to the cancellation of Silent Hills...\n\nAll sorts of unfortunate, and what's more unfortunate\nis the unknown future of Konami...but understandable for\nall the bad decisions/management that's been happening there.\n\nBut forcefully removing P.T. from PSN store, making it not available\nto anyone to play/download ever again (unless it's already on their\nsystems) even to those who have downloaded it before is just plain wrong.\n\nIt CAN'T be found anywhere in retail format as it doesn't\nexist in any physical form, thus it's erased altogether\neverywhere AND worse is that Konami is going against those\nwho have the game on their PS4 and delisting anyone who's selling it on eBay.\n\nWho knows what they'll do next to those who still have the game.\n...\n\nBut with thanks to those who've found a way to download the\ngame directly, I was able to and thankfully found a copy of this\ngame (only the EU) and thus prevent the complete erasure of this game.\n\nWith this copy of the EU Version of the game, it can live on\nand in the future when the PS4 is jailbroken/emulated/etc, this\ngame can then be played! (That or using the method if possible).\n\nSPREAD THIS AROUND!\nFEEL FREE TO UPLOAD IT ANYWHERE!\nSEED FOR AS LONG AS YOU CAN FOR EVERYONE!\n\nThat is all and game on!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37764628b678a6f0944a4509f7a8b6ecd4ae792f","amp;dn":"P.T+%5BPS4.PSN.EU%5D+%5BPKG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37764628b678a6f0944a4509f7a8b6ecd4ae792f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,118,70,40,182,120,166,240,148,74,69,9,247,168,182,236,212,174,121,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
