BembÃƒÂ© is a fascinatingly varied set of percussion and vocal Santeria chants to various deities, as well as examples of Colombian and Mexican rhythms. \n\nIn the songs from the original Our Man, Santamaria tinkers with the standard instrumentation of the Cuban conjunto and the orquesta tipica and revisits classic styles such as cha cha. \n\nThe second part of the set explores the ritual music of the Orishas (often referred to as Santeria) and traditional rumba. For this project, Santamaria assembled a group that included singers Merceditas Valdes and Carlos Embale and, for good measure, his friend Willie Bobo, the only non-Cuban. The austere recording and crisp playing bring out the beauty and power of this music, at once deeply spiritual and earthy. \n\nMongo Santamaria went on to make his name in Latin jazz history with his playing, his bands, and his writing. But this album, showing his more traditional side, is a classic.\n\n \nCD / 1993 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist / Our Man in Havana:\n1.\tJamaicuba (3:30) \n2.\tManila (4:47) \n3.\tHe Guapacha (4:13) \n4.\tCha Cha Rock (3:51) \n5.\tVengan pollos (5:04) \n6.\tBarandanga (3:21) \n7.\tLinda Guajira (3:07) \n8.\tVamos a gozar (2:39) \n9.\tMiss Patti Cha Cha (4:20) \n10.\tViva la felicidad (2:35)\nTracklist / BembÃƒÂ©: \n11.\tTele Mina for Chango (3:04) \n12.\tOlla De for Olla (3:52) \n13.\tYemaya Olodo for Olla (3:41) \n14.\tYeye-o for Ochun (4:14) \n15.\tWolenche for Chango (2:48) \n16.\tAqua limpia (3:41) \n17.\tOchun Mene (4:15) \n18.\tMexico (Guaguanco) (3:24) \n19.\tMaÃƒÂ±ana son maÃƒÂ±ana (4:11) \n20.\tComplicaciones (3:48) \n\n\n\nIncluded in Vibe's 100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century.\n\n\n\nStraight, no chaser.\n\n:)\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac66fd18c3f97c7f8886ef8e5dee52f813fc8c6a","amp;dn":"Mongo+Santamaria+-+Our+Man+in+Havana+1960","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac66fd18c3f97c7f8886ef8e5dee52f813fc8c6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,102,253,24,195,249,124,127,136,134,239,142,93,238,82,248,19,252,140,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
