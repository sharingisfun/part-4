Rachel is sent to Auschwitz, unaware that her husband has been shot. Priska and her husband travel there together, but are immediately separated. Also at Auschwitz, Anka hopes in vain to be reunited with her husband. With the rest of their families gassed, these young wives are determined to hold on to all they have leftÃ¢â‚¬â€their lives, and those of their unborn babies. Having concealed their condition from infamous Nazi doctor Josef Mengele, they are forced to work and almost starved to death, living in daily fear of their pregnancies being detected by the SS.\n\nIn April 1945, as the Allies close in, Priska gives birth. She and her baby, along with Anka, Rachel, and the remaining inmates, are sent to Mauthausen concentration camp on a hellish seventeen-day train journey. Rachel gives birth on the train, and Anka at the camp gates. All believe they will die, but then a miracle occurs. The gas chamber runs out of Zyklon-B, and as the Allied troops near, the SS flee. Against all odds, the three mothers and their newborns survive their treacherous journey to freedom.\n\nOn the seventieth anniversary of MauthausenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s liberation from the Nazis by American soldiers, renowned biographer Wendy Holden recounts this extraordinary story of three children united by their mothersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ unbelievableÃ¢â‚¬â€yet ultimately successfulÃ¢â‚¬â€fight for survival","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79fdd511640e69e77bb05320f1220bede8ccfe63","amp;dn":"Born+Survivors+-+Wendy+Holden","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79fdd511640e69e77bb05320f1220bede8ccfe63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,253,213,17,100,14,105,231,123,176,83,32,241,34,11,237,232,204,254,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
