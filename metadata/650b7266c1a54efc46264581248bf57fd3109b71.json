I suspect that I am not alone in keeping a copy near my desk, so that when I develop a sudden interest in some topic, I can obtain a summary of nearly current knowledge and a list of reading references immediately. The information of ratio to price makes this book a wonderful bargain.&quot; --American Scientist\n\n&quot;March has been uncompromising in his search for clarity and utility in presentations of a wide variety of essential organic chemistry. It remains an accessible and useful tool for both specialists and non-specialists in the field. It does an excellent job both as a text for first-year graduate students and a handy reference for others.&quot; --Journal of Chemical Education\nFrom the Back Cover\nFrom the reviews of the Fourth Edition ...\n\n&quot;March has been uncompromising in his search for clarity and utility in presentations of a wide variety of essential organic chemistry.
