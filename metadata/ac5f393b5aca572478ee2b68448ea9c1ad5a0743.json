Players will build a kingdom up, send Sims on quests, and earn rewards in the form of Kingdom Points. The game diverges from the series in that players can win the game by achieving a kingdom ambition. Confirmed ambitions include &quot;Best In Show&quot;, &quot;Busy Builder&quot;, &quot;Efficient Expander&quot;, &quot;Fame&quot;, &quot;Filled Coffers&quot;, &quot;Hard Workers&quot;, &quot;Imperial Domination&quot;, &quot;Legendary&quot;, &quot;No Quest For The Weary&quot;, &quot;Safe And Sound&quot;, &quot;Thoughts And Prayers&quot;, and &quot;Wealthy Populace&quot;.\n\nIn a change from other Sims games, the character creation, simulation, and architectural aspects are significantly reduced and altered to enforce a sharper focus on RPG-style gameplay.\n\nNice kick to an old franchise. \n\nTips to Demonoid.
