Sure, we know\nthe setting well and Wilson is a little too passive at times, but this is where\nhe wants to be and he fully immerses himself in his passion for sun-baked,\ncountry-tinged sounds, wrapped in guitars, pianos and mellowed rhythms.&quot;\nbowlegsmusic.com\n\n&quot;Wilson has a rich folk lineage... so it is no surprise that this record is\nrustic, both in sound and imagery. A carefully crafted album likely to find\nfavour with fans of Wilco or Crosby, Stills and Nash.&quot; list.co.uk\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb953d68f43e47927a291fad1553a577dde45ed3","amp;dn":"Jonathan_Wilson-Gentle_Spirit-2011-404","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb953d68f43e47927a291fad1553a577dde45ed3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,149,61,104,244,62,71,146,122,41,31,173,21,83,165,119,221,228,94,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
