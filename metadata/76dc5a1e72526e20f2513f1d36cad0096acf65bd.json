It is almost like VirtualDub, but can also encode \nto VCD/SVCD/DVD mpg. Most common codecs are supported (M-JPEG, MPEG, DivX, Xvid, huffyuv, WMA, etc.) thanks to libavcodec and libmpeg2. \nVideo can be edited, cut, appended, filtered (resize/crop/denoise), and re-encoded to either AVI (DivX/Xvid) or MPEG 1/2.\n\nAvidemux is a free video editor designed for simple cutting, filtering and encoding tasks.It supports many file types, including AVI, DVD compatible MPEG files, \nMP4 and ASF, using a variety of codecs. Tasks can be automated using projects, job queue and powerful scripting capabilities. Avidemux is available for \nLinux, BSD, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows under the GNU GPL license. The program was written from scratch by Mean, but code from other people and \nprojects has been used as well. Patches, translations and even bug reports are always welcome.\n\navidemux.org\n\nPLZ SEED AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76dc5a1e72526e20f2513f1d36cad0096acf65bd","amp;dn":"AviDemux+2.6.0.7907+%2B+Portable%5BTeam+Nanban%5D%5BTPB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76dc5a1e72526e20f2513f1d36cad0096acf65bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,220,90,30,114,82,110,32,242,81,63,29,54,202,208,9,106,207,101,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
