As a result the uploader often has to use bandwidth to keep older \ntorrents alive for those who hop on later and it slows things down for \neverybody. It may also result in the uploader not uploading anything new as \nthere is no bandwidth to spare. Keeping torrents \nopen helps everybody. The seeder gets upload credit, the leecher might get the \nshow a bit faster and it frees the regular uploaders to upload new stuff. \n\nSo, if possible, please stay on what you download. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nemesis.1337x.org/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nemesis.1337x.org/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pow7.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pow7.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n\n[/code] \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a52fe554fa30638bc129bf396a4669c6617388e1","amp;dn":"The+Little+Mermaid+DVDRip+h264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a52fe554fa30638bc129bf396a4669c6617388e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,47,229,84,250,48,99,139,193,41,191,57,106,70,105,198,97,115,136,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
