T. Joshi s critically acclaimed Black Wings series contains eighteen stories by leading contemporary writers, all drawing upon themes, images, and ideas from the life and work of H. P. Lovecraft. CaitlÃƒÂ­n R. Kiernan has written a poetic reinterpretation of The Hound, while Nicholas Royle plays a fascinating riff on the existential horror of The Outsider. Three separate tales, by Jason C. Eckhardt, Brian Evenson, and Jonathan Thomas, ring changes on Lovecraft s seminal story, The Call of Cthulhu. Nick Mamatas writes an ingenious elaboration of The Whisperer in Darkness. The cosmic indifferentism that is the core of Lovecraft s fiction is treated in various ways by John Langan, Melanie Tem, Tom Fletcher, Darrell Schweitzer, and Richard Gavin. The archaeological horror that we find in some of Lovecraft s most powerful tales is revivified by Donald Tyson, while Lovecraft s media presence is made the subject of half-comic, half-horrific tales by Don Webb and Chet Williamson. John Shirley, Rick Dakan, and Jason V Brock use Lovecraft s life and outlook as springboards for imaginative tales of psychological and supernatural horror. All in all, Black Wings II affords a rich feast of terror inspired by the twentieth century s greatest writer of the supernatural.\n\nContents:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“When Death Wakes Me to MyselfÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by John Shirley\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ViewÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by Tom Fletcher\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“HoundwifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by CaitlÃƒÂ­n R.
