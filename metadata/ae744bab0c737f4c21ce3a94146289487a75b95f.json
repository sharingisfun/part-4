No other book has both information for designing your own socks and such fabulous, never-before-published designer patterns. It includes background on the social and historical development of sock knitting (complete with historical photos), techniques (top-down, bottom-up, many different heel and toe styles), stitch patterns, and socks from a wide variety of ethnic traditions. Since sock knitting requires only the most basic skills, like casting on, knitting in the round, decreasing, working short rows, picking up stitches, binding off and seamless joining, itÃ‚â€™s a great place for beginners to start.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae744bab0c737f4c21ce3a94146289487a75b95f","amp;dn":"Vogue+Knitting+The+Ultimate+Sock+Book","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae744bab0c737f4c21ce3a94146289487a75b95f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,116,75,171,12,115,127,76,33,206,58,148,20,98,137,72,122,117,185,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
