Growing up close with nature has given him\na deep understanding of nutritional needs required by diet sensitive animals on the reserve. Unfortunately, the untimely and tragic death of his mother propelled him into a downward spiral and he risked flunking out of school. This led to his fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s decision to home-school Garrett.\nHis first assignment was to study a controversial book written by Dr. Max Gerson.\n\nWritten over 50 years ago, Dr. Gerson found that diet could, and did, cure cancer. Controversial at the time (and even today),\nGarrett took on the challenge of researching this amazing therapy, which drew the interest of his neighbors in the small Alaskan community.\nWith the help of Dr. GersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s daughter, Charlotte Gerson, and grandson, Howard Strauss, they gave him the ammunition needed to go in search\nfor the truth ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a truth that would affect not only him, but his entire Alaskan village ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ all of whom wanted to know if these claims were true.\nAfter a number of cancer patients, who were diagnosed as terminal, shared their stories and their medical records with Garrett, it became\nabundantly clear that, contrary to the disinformation campaign spear-headed by the multi-billion dollar medical and pharmaceutical industry,\na cure for virtually all cancers and chronic diseases does exist ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and has existed for over 80 years!\n\nGarrettÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mission now is to tell the world.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thebeautifultruthmovie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thebeautifultruthmovie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ced54df9bf337e5d113fa317c7c4567e9dd0261","amp;dn":"The+Beautiful+Truth+%282008%29+Gerson+Cancer+Therapy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ced54df9bf337e5d113fa317c7c4567e9dd0261","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,237,84,223,155,243,55,229,209,19,250,49,124,124,69,103,233,221,2,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
