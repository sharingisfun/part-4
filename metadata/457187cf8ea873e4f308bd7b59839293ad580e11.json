In war movies he was probably at his most effective as his whole bearing says 'I'm in charge'. He also has a personal life - a romance with croaky nurse Maggie (Patricia Neal, good as ever), and conflict with his sulky son Jere (Brandon de Wilde). Also in the cast are Stanley Holloway (as an Australian who leads the soldiers through dangerous terrain), Burgess Meredith (who has the memorable discussion about cowardice with Wayne), Dana Andrews, Franchot Tone, Henry Fonda, Bruce Cabot, Tom Tryon, George Kennedy, and James Mitchum.\n\nThis Otto Preminger film is as much about the lives of men at war as it is about battle sequences (although when they appear they are impressive). It also boasts an interesting sequence of shots over its end titles. Perhaps too long at two and a half hours plus, it nevertheless has a decent script, clever characterisations, and manages to keep the viewer awake.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:457187cf8ea873e4f308bd7b59839293ad580e11","amp;dn":"In+Harms+Way+%7BJohn+Wayne%2C+Kirk+Douglas%7D+%5B1965%5D+%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"457187cf8ea873e4f308bd7b59839293ad580e11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,113,135,207,142,168,115,228,243,8,189,123,89,131,146,147,173,88,14,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
