He hasn't been back in 10 years since the people of the town turned on him believing that he was responsible for his brothers death. His brother, Ryan Cole, was the beloved &quot;fair haired boy&quot; of Kaler Mills. Loved by all, hated by none. After his death in a tragic farm accident a video was released that made it seem that Kyle could have prevented his brothers death. Now, armed with a documentary crew, Kyle has returned to face his demons. But he forgot about one of them... This is an 80's style creature feature with a modern twist. Made with practical effects and classic stop motion monster techniques, The Dooms Chapel Horror will keep you on the edge of your seat to the very end.\r\n\r\nDirector: John William Holt (as John Holt)\r\nWriters: Jason Turner (story), Jason Turner\r\nStars: Bill Oberst Jr., Austin Madding, Abby Murphy\r\nGenres: Horror | Mystery | Thriller\r\nCountry: USA\r\nLanguage: English\r\n\r\n\r\nRELEASE: The.Dooms.Chapel.Horror.2016.HDRip.XviD.AC3-EVO\r\n                                             \r\nSOURCE: 720p - Thanks King-DVD!                                              \r\n\r\nViDEO: 1900 Kbps\r\n\r\nRESOLUTiON: 720x400\r\n\r\nRUNTiME: 1h 34m 43s \r\n\r\nSUBTiTLES: No                             \r\n\r\nAUDiO: 192 Kbps AC3 2.0     \r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLiSH                                    \r\n\r\nNOTES: Enjoy.\r\n\r\n SPECIAL THANKS TO: The Big Boss WIGWIG, ANSA, ACHOSINK,\r\n                 HAMADA, MAZENTBT, CD-Moonlight, EMPEROR_DVD.  \r\n\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aXS6 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aXSV \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aXSu \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aXSv","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:395f0d1751da196849ed4931fcc6a02351e2a38b","amp;dn":"The.Dooms.Chapel.Horror.2016.HDRip.XviD.AC3-EVO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"395f0d1751da196849ed4931fcc6a02351e2a38b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,95,13,23,81,218,25,104,73,237,73,49,252,198,160,35,81,226,163,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
