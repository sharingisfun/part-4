Produced by Bob Johnston, the album marked Dylan's return to acoustic music and traditional roots, after three albums of electric rock music. John Wesley Harding shares many stylistic threads with, and was recorded around the same time as, the prolific series of home recording sessions with The Band, partly released in 1975 as The Basement Tapes.\n\nJohn Wesley Harding was exceptionally well received by critics and enjoyed solid sales, reaching #2 on the US charts and topping the UK charts. The commercial performance was considered remarkable considering that Dylan had kept Columbia from releasing the album with much promotion or publicity . Less than three months after its release, John Wesley Harding was certified gold by the RIAA. &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; became one of his most popular songs after it was recorded by Jimi Hendrix the following year.\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 301 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nAll songs written by Bob Dylan\n\n    &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:58\n    &quot;As I Went Out One Morning&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:49\n    &quot;I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:53\n    &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:31\n    &quot;The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:35\n    &quot;Drifter's Escape&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:52\n    &quot;Dear Landlord&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:16\n    &quot;I Am a Lonesome Hobo&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:19\n    &quot;I Pity the Poor Immigrant&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:12\n    &quot;The Wicked Messenger&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:02\n    &quot;Down Along the Cove&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:23\n    &quot;I'll Be Your Baby Tonight&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:34","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d046ed9a6d7db894e37c37c76709ec44be38c725","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+John+Wesley+Harding+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d046ed9a6d7db894e37c37c76709ec44be38c725","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,70,237,154,109,125,184,148,227,124,55,199,103,9,236,68,190,56,199,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
