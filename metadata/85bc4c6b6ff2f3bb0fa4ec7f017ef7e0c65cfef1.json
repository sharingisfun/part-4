A cursory listen to My Aim Is True proves that the main connection that Costello had with the punks was his unbridled passion; he tore through rock's back pages taking whatever he wanted, as well as borrowing from country, Tin Pan Alley pop, reggae, and many other musical genres. Over his career, that musical eclecticism distinguished his records as much as his fiercely literate lyrics. Because he supported his lyrics with his richly diverse music, Costello emerged as one of the most innovative, influential, and best songwriters since Bob Dylan. \n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.95% CDDA &amp; 99.90% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tRhino\nCatalog:\t\tR2 76652\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.(WhatÃ‚Â´s So The FunnyÃ‚Â´Bout) Peace, Love &amp; Understanding\n02.OliverÃ‚Â´s Army\n03.Watching The Detectives\n04.Alison\n05.(I DonÃ‚Â´t Want To Go To) Chelsea\n06.Accidents Will Happen\n07.Pump It Up\n08.I CanÃ‚Â´t Stand Up For Falling Down\n09.Radio Radio\n10.Clubland\n11.Good Year For The Roses\n12.Man Out Of Time\n13.I Wanna Be Loved\n14.Everyday I Write The Book\n15.Brilliant Mistake\n16.The Other Side Of Summer\n17.Tokyo Storm Warning\n18.Sulky Girl\n19.So Like Candy\n20.Veronica\n21.She\n\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Big Tears\n02.Beyond Belief\n03.Lipstick Vogue\n04.Green Shirt\n05.Pills And Soap\n06.Tramp The Dirt Down\n07.Shipbuilding\n08.High Fidelity\n09.New Lace Sleeves\n10.(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes\n11.Talking In The Dark\n12.New Amsterdam\n13.I Hope You're Happy Now\n14.Riot Act\n15.My Funny Valentine\n16.Indoor Fireworks\n17.Almost Blue\n18.I Want You\n19.God Give Me Strength\n20.That Day Is Done\n21.I Want To Vanish\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85bc4c6b6ff2f3bb0fa4ec7f017ef7e0c65cfef1","amp;dn":"Elvis+Costello+-+Very+Best+Of++2CD++%282000%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85bc4c6b6ff2f3bb0fa4ec7f017ef7e0c65cfef1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,188,76,107,111,242,243,187,15,164,236,127,1,126,247,224,198,92,254,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
