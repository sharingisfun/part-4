Booming record sales, Grammy awards, movie roles, and a romance with rapper/CEO Jay-Z combined to heighten her profile in the 2000s, making the singer a virtual mainstay in the entertainment world. While some media outlets derisively championed Paris Hilton as &quot;the next Marilyn Monroe,&quot; BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© was a much better contender for the role, her glittering pop culture persona only matched by her success onscreen and on record.\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01.
