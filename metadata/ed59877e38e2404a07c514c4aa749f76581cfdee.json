That it took Clapton so long to go out on his own, however, was evidence of a degree of reticence unusual for one of his stature. And his debut album, though it spawned the Top 40 hit &quot;After Midnight,&quot; was typical of his self-effacing approach: it was, in effect, an album by the group he had lately been featured in, Delaney &amp; Bonnie &amp; Friends.\n\n\nGenre................: Rock\nYear.................: 2014\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Cue, Audiochecker\n\n\n\n01.They Call Me The Breeze\n02.Rock And Roll Records (Feat.
