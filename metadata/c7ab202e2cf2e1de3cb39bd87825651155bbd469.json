Under Rubin's supervision, he recorded the album in his living room, accompanied only by his guitar. For years Cash had often been at odds with his producers after he had discovered with his first producer, Sam Phillips, that his voice was better suited to a stripped-down musical style. Most famously he disagreed with Jack Clement over his sound, Clement having tried to give Cash's songs a &quot;twangy&quot; feel and to add strings and barbershop-quartet-style singers, and his successful collaboration with Rick Rubin was in part due to Rubin seeking a minimalist sound for his songs.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7ab202e2cf2e1de3cb39bd87825651155bbd469","amp;dn":"Johnny+Cash-American+recordings+1994+...320kbps+%28stPaddy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7ab202e2cf2e1de3cb39bd87825651155bbd469","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,171,32,46,44,242,225,222,60,179,155,216,120,37,101,17,85,187,212,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
