The Dark Knight's file on the case has long been closed, the foundations of Bruce Wayne's secret life secure. But these foundations are shaken when an unexpected guest invades the grounds of Wayne Manor, raising questions about the event that ended the lives of the mother he loved and the father he worshipped, and sparked his unquenchable drive to protect and avenge.\n\nTo discover his true family history, Batman must face down old foes, confront his only confidant, invade the evil heart of Arkham Asylum, and shoulder the terrible new burden of a dark legacy.\n\nRelease Date: Nov 1, 2013\nApproximate Running Time: 6 Hours\nNumber of CDs: 6\nISBN # 978-1-62851-032-4\nContent Rating: Ages 13+\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
