Readers familiar with the previous edition will find a text that retains all the features that make Rulebook ideally suited for use as a supplementary course book -- including its modest price and compact size. Unlike most textbooks on argumentative writing, Rulebook is organised around specific rules, illustrated and explained soundly and briefly. It is not a textbook, but a rulebook, whose goal is to help students get on with writing a paper or assessing an argument.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79fa4465d85cb849cca239c30171c1ded063e721","amp;dn":"A+Rulebook+For+Arguments+-+3rd+Edition.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79fa4465d85cb849cca239c30171c1ded063e721","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,250,68,101,216,92,184,73,204,162,57,195,1,113,193,222,208,99,231,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
