Prejudice and segregation has stained the lives of countless black persons and BB 'Riley' King made sure that through his music, he never allowed it to mar his spirit. \r\nThis is the essence of the story that makes a beautiful film, both informative and visually captivating. \r\n\r\n\r\nGSpot says: \r\nDVD VOB format\r\nMPEG-2Program Stream &lt;&lt; (1 vid, 1 aud)\r\nSys Bitrate 10080 kb/s VBR 5611 kbps I/L TFF\r\nPAL 16:9\r\n\r\nAC3 0xbd(0x80):48000Hz 384 kb/s tot.\r\nstereo (2/0) \r\n\r\n\r\nPlay It LOUD!\r\n\r\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6de3c8f47b2130697eef0bf0cc5543450d71bf7c","amp;dn":"B.B.+King+-+The+Life+Of+Riley+-+Documentary+-+BBC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6de3c8f47b2130697eef0bf0cc5543450d71bf7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,227,200,244,123,33,48,105,126,239,11,240,204,85,67,69,13,113,191,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
