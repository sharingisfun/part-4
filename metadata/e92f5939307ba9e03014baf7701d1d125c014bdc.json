Little Donnie and Baby Boy Phil sang on Ike's early-morning radio shows in Iowa.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving school, the brothers moved to Nashville where, under the wing of Ike Everly's friend, the highly talented musician Chet Atkins, Don and Phil signed with Cadence Records. They exploded onto the music scene in 1957 with Bye Bye Love, written by Boudleaux and Felice Bryant.\r\n\r\nAfter Bye Bye Love came other hits, notably Wake Up Little Susie, followed by the worldwide smash hit All I Have to Do Is Dream and a long string of other great songs which also became hits.\r\n\r\nBy 1960, however, the brothers were lured away from Cadence to Warner Bros with a $1,000,000 contract. Their biggest hit followed, the self-penned Cathy's Clown, which sold 8 million copies. Remaining at Warner Bros for most of the 60s, they had further success with Walk Right Back, So Sad and the King/Greenfield-penned track Crying in the Rain.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: h264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: 2205Kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: 93.5Kbps CBR 48KHz\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 59 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 1014 MB\r\nSource: Webrip\r\nEncoded by: BBC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e92f5939307ba9e03014baf7701d1d125c014bdc","amp;dn":"The+Everly+Brothers+Harmonies+From+Heaven+720p+h264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e92f5939307ba9e03014baf7701d1d125c014bdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,47,89,57,48,123,169,224,48,20,186,247,112,29,29,18,92,1,75,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
