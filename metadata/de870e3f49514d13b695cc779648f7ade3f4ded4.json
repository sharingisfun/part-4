SUCCESSFUL WRITING AT WORK features an abundance of real-world examples and problems, as well as an accessible writing style and detailed guidelines for planning, drafting, revising, editing, and producing professional documents and graphics.\n\nStudents are presented with topics in four logically sequenced sections, beginning with basic business communications, and proceeding to conducting research, documenting sources, and handling more advanced tasks such as reports, proposals, and oral presentations. With each new task, students learn to become effective problem-solvers at work, to understand their audience, and to select the best communication tools to accomplish their goals.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the Author:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPhilip C.
