They are more accurate than the test patterns found on previous discs. There are a lot of subtle details that go into making them as mathematically accurate as possible, especially since you are dealing with lossy encoding. We have built propriety tools to generate the synthetic patterns. We use a custom encoder that will preserve as much detail as possible. Even the simple color bars have unique traits that make them cleaner. - Stacey Spears, author of the disc&quot; \n\nPicture Quality Calibration and Evaluation Tool for Displays, Blu-ray Players and Video Processors\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE: This disc is a high-definition disc and is compatible only with Blu-ray players. It will not play on a standard DVD player.\n\nCNET: \nThe good: Well-designed test patterns, advanced deinterlacing/video processing tests.\nThe bad: Not for beginners.\nThe bottom line: The Spears and Munsil Blu-ray is an advanced tool for evaluating many aspects of a television's performance. I use it while testing every TV and Blu-ray player I review.\nIf you have a fair amount of knowledge, and know your way around a setup menu, this disc is awesome.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://howto.cnet.com/8301-11310_39-20060847-285/reviewed-blu-ray-setup-discs-for-your-hdtv/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://howto.cnet.com/8301-11310_39-20060847-285/reviewed-blu-ray-setup-discs-for-your-hdtv/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou will need a blue color filter if your TV doesn't have a blue only mode. Most probably it doesn't.\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74c99c768ddff31435b0490c9697212983956d90","amp;dn":"Spears+%26amp%3B+Munsil+High-Definition+Benchmark+Blu-ray+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74c99c768ddff31435b0490c9697212983956d90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,201,156,118,141,223,243,20,53,176,73,12,150,151,33,41,131,149,109,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
