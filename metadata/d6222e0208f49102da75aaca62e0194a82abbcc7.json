Originally formed in 1969, the quartet recorded several albums of jazz standards as well as much material closer to R&amp;B/pop. Still, they were easily the most popular jazz vocal group of their era, and the most talented of any since the heyday of Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross during the early '60s.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tVocal\t\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nThis eclectic collection of songs encompasses jazz, bebop, swing, doo wop, rock &amp; roll, and gospel; all are trimmed in an attractive pop texture. These 16 compositions are taken from the vocal quartet's albums, which span 12 years (1975-1987). Each selection is inviting, as all four song stylists display their individual vocal skills and admirable harmonies. Laurel Masse appears on recordings up until 1979, when Cheryl Bentyne replaced her. Other members include Tim Hauser, Janis Siegel, and Alan Paul.\n\n01.Boy From New York City\n02.Trickle Trickle\n03.Gloria\n04.Operator\n05.Tuxedo Junction\n06.Four Brothers\n07.Ray's Rockhouse\n08.Soul Food To Go (Sina)\n09.Spice Of Life\n10.Baby Come Back To Me (The Morse Code Of Love)\n11.Candy\n12.A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square\n13.Birdland\n14.Java Jive\n15.Route 66\n16.Twilight Zone/Twilight Tone\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6222e0208f49102da75aaca62e0194a82abbcc7","amp;dn":"Manhattan+Transfer+-+The+Very+Best+Of++%281994%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6222e0208f49102da75aaca62e0194a82abbcc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,34,46,2,8,244,145,2,218,117,170,202,98,224,25,74,130,171,188,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
