The key is that Perfectly Clear Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcorrects photos Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it doesn't enhance photos. A corrected photo is superior to an Ã¢â‚¬Å“enhancedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ photo, and not by a little but by a lot, and here's why.\n\nPerfectly Clear means Superior Quality Photos\n\nThere are multiple reasons why a Perfectly Clear photo is superior to other photos. Perfectly Clear reproduces what the eye sees by Ã¢â‚¬Å“adding backÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the eye function that a camera lacks. By better reproducing what the eye sees, Perfectly Clear photos elicit enthusiastic responses from participants, audiences and photographers alike. Photography is the art of eliciting emotion, and Perfectly Clear does it best.\n\nThis is only possible because Perfectly Clear applies 10 patented and patent pending processes in a very precise and rigorous way, replicating how the eye gathers light and overcoming the 15 ways your camera distorts your photos. Whether a camera is expensive or off the shelf, it still embodies limitations such as the single aperture which need to be overcome. Perfectly Clear makes its corrections while avoiding the pitfalls that all other editing and enhancement software introduce. And Perfectly Clear ensures quality through the auto Ã¢â‚¬â€œ correction applying a comprehensive suite of 12 corrections, yet it is smart enough to only apply the ones that a particular photo needs to be improved.\n\nQuality award winning photos demands the three things Perfect Photos need: accurate colors, perfect exposure emulating the human eye and preservation of color nuances and details.\n\nBut it's important to us that you make an informed decision.
