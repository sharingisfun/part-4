Recorded on October 5 and 6 in 1959, guitarist Montgomery is joined by organist Melvin Rhyne and drummer Paul Parker. Montgomery's style, block chords and octaves, is already firmly in place, and he delivers lovely solos on &quot;'Round Midnight,&quot; &quot;Whisper Not,&quot; and &quot;Satin Doll.&quot; The choice of material, in fact, from classics like &quot;Yesterdays&quot; to originals like Montgomery's &quot;Jingles,&quot; never falters. The only drawback is that the accompaniment, which though solid, doesn't seem to perfectly match his guitar style. One gets the impression that Montgomery's forceful, deliberate style would be better-served by beefier arrangements. Having said this, Montgomery's performance -- coming at the end of a decade represented by guitarists like Tal Farlow and Barney Kessel -- must have been a revolution in technique and execution. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a 36-year-old guitarist re-imagines the jazz guitar solo. There are two bonus tracks on The Wes Montgomery Trio: extra takes of &quot;Satin Doll&quot; and &quot;Missile Blues.&quot; Although later Riverside recordings of Montgomery are more fully realized, fans will enjoy returning to the moment when he first burst upon the jazz scene.\n\nTracklist\n\n1 'Round Midnight Written-By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Hanighen*, Williams*, Monk* 4:58\n2 Yesterdays Written-By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kern*, Harbach* 3:20\n3 The End Of A Love Affair Written-By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Edward Redding* 3:18\n4 Whisper Not Written-By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Benny Golson 4:40\n5 Ecaroh Written-By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Horace Silver 3:01\n6 Satin Doll (Take 5) Written-By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Duke Ellington 4:09\n7 Satin Doll Written-By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ellington* 3:59\n8 Missile Blues (Take 5) Written-By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Wes Montgomery 4:37\n9 Missile Blues Written-By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Montgomery* 6:04\n10 Too Late Now Written-By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Lerner*, Lane* 4:55\n11 Jingles Written-By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Montgomery* 5:32\n\n\nCredits\n\nCover [Production And Design] Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Harris Lewine, Jules Maidoff, Ken Braren, Paul Bacon (2)\nDrums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Paul Parker (2)\nEngineer [Recording] Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jack Higgins\nGuitar Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Wes Montgomery\nLiner Notes, Producer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Orrin Keepnews\nOrgan Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Melvin Rhyne*\nRemastered By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Joe Tarantino\n\nNotes\n\nRecorded in New York; October 5 and 6, 1959.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eca4bb4ed55cb2d6a5c805954d290d30e88ff447","amp;dn":"Wes+Montgomery+-+A+Dynamic+New+Sound+%5BEAC+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eca4bb4ed55cb2d6a5c805954d290d30e88ff447","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,164,187,78,213,92,178,214,165,200,5,149,77,41,13,48,232,143,244,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
