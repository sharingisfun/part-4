A free app. that will extract .RAR archives is 7-Zip from http://www.7-zip.org/\n \n - PAL source, but of course plays like any other AVI file. Behold the power of tech!\n \n - I seed using &quot;Initial Seeding&quot; which means that the torrent may show zero seeds; disregard this as I will seed for up to several days until there are enough other seeds.\n \n - Please make sure to seed as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to at least 101%, no torrent would ever die.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:486ba87ad12601e559b59b15bba1ff9c4fe4b25d","amp;dn":"Life+is+Sweet+%281990%29.DVDRip.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"486ba87ad12601e559b59b15bba1ff9c4fe4b25d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,107,168,122,209,38,1,229,89,181,155,21,187,161,255,156,79,228,178,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
