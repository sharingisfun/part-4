His &quot;line&quot; Wildstorm was eventually bought by DC, where he's now a Co-Publisher.\n\nI dunno how I've become &quot;the Jim Lee guy&quot; but I've posted a lot of WildC.A.T.s and Divine Right this year, lol. So right now, I'm banning myself from any more Jim Lee or X-Men torrents in September!\n\nAlso in this torrent are some .CBRs of Comic Images trading card sets (released when let Comic Images license their art, before Marvel got into the trading card biz with Impel in 1990). And scans of the comic book &quot;reprint&quot; mini-series of Lee's 105-card X-Men card set that was all-original art. (And one of my 3 or 4 personal favorite card sets ever.)\n\nI've included Uncanny X-Men issues like #280 and #286 for which Jim only drew the covers. Oh, and also the X-Men trade that reprinted #1-7 of the '91 title.\n\nSeed and share! Pretty please? Americans, Happy Labor Day from me (again).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a5de4bedb045ef072e859ae80aba91ff2214f3a","amp;dn":"X-MEN+%28Chris+Claremont%2C+Jim+Lee%29+%281989-1991%29+plus+Lee+extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a5de4bedb045ef072e859ae80aba91ff2214f3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,93,228,190,219,4,94,240,114,232,89,174,128,171,169,31,242,33,79,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
