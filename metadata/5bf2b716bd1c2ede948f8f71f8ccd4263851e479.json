Newman, C. Walter Newman (Wiley, 2008).pdf\r\n\r\nWith coverage of chemistry, genetics, and molecular breeding, this book provides comprehensive and current information on barley types, composition, characteristics, processing techniques, and products. Its emphasis on the nutritional and health benefits of barley is especially timely with the FDA s 2005 confirmation of barley s cholesterol-lowering properties. This resource discusses barley s role in breads and related products, and reviews its health benefits, biotechnology, and breeding applications. This is the definitive resource for cereal chemists, food scientists, nutritionists, grain and food processors, and students in appropriate courses","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bf2b716bd1c2ede948f8f71f8ccd4263851e479","amp;dn":"Barley+for+Food+and+Health+-+Science%2C+Technology%2C+and+Products","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bf2b716bd1c2ede948f8f71f8ccd4263851e479","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,242,183,22,189,28,46,222,148,143,143,113,248,204,212,38,56,81,228,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
