The album was certified quadruple platinum in the UK.\n Although the album failed to chart in the United States, &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot; became a minor hit there.\n\n[b]Track List:[/b]\n\n      1. &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:51\n   2. &quot;Tracy Jacks&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:20\n   3. &quot;End of a Century&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 2:45\n   4. &quot;Parklife&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:05\n   5. &quot;Bank Holiday&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 1:42\n   6. &quot;Badhead&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:25\n   7. &quot;The Debt Collector&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 2:10\n   8. &quot;Far Out&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 1:41\n   9. &quot;To the End&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:05\n  10. &quot;London Loves&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:15\n  11. &quot;Trouble in the Message Centre&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:09\n  12. &quot;Clover Over Dover&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:22\n  13. &quot;Magic America&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:38\n  14. &quot;Jubilee&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 2:47\n  15. &quot;This Is a Low&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 5:07\n  16. &quot;Lot 105&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 1:17\n\n[b]Released:[/b] 25 April 1994\n[b]Recorded: [/b]October 1993ÃƒÂ¢??January 1994\n[b]Genre:[/b]Britpop\n[b]Length:[/b] 52:39\n[b]Label:[/b] Food\n[b]Producer:[/b] Stephen Street\n[b]Format:[/b] MP3\n[b]File Size:[/b] 121MB\nBitrate: 200+kbs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edf1dd251c7e6b025929fd3db1d02a25e6110b1f","amp;dn":"Blur-Parklife+%5B1994%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edf1dd251c7e6b025929fd3db1d02a25e6110b1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,241,221,37,28,126,107,2,89,41,253,61,177,208,42,37,230,17,11,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
