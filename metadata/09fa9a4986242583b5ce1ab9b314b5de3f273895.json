Its visual sumptuousness lands somewhere between Ingres and Renoir but with stylisÃ‚Â­tic provocations worthy of a time-travelling Baudelaire. In the nineteenth century, much of the Parisian sex trade was confined to grands maisons, populated by elegant madams and a vetted clientele. They were akin to social clubs, with the gentleman participants expected to be as charming and witty as they might be in more respectable drawÃ‚Â­ing rooms. The ladies were provocatively dressed and, upstairs, occupied numerous boudoirs ready for carnal pleasures. Even in such a controlled environment, dangers still lurked: disease was rampant and lethal, and sometimes even a gentleman might lose his temper and harm one of the women. House of Tolerance immerses us in this long-abandoned world, awash with opium, champagne and the inevitable rush of semen. The filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pace accentuates the languor of the place, its many personages slowly revealing their life journeys like an old-fashioned striptease. Several of the stories are grim: country girls desperate for money, dumped from failed relationships or, most difficult to watch, slashed with a knife for little apparent reason. And yet there is grace, especially in the daytime moments of sisterly camaraderie and the casual yet oddly affectionate deceits of the madam (in a stern turn from the forÃ‚Â­midable NoÃƒÂ©mie Lvovsky). This spirit carries into moments when modernity intrudes, most notably in a penultimate dance Ã¢â‚¬â€ as the brothel is about to be closed under order of the mayor Ã¢â‚¬â€ to the tune of an oddly approÃ‚Â­priate Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nights in White Satin.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09fa9a4986242583b5ce1ab9b314b5de3f273895","amp;dn":"House+of+Tolerance+-+House+of+Pleasures+-+L%27Apollonide+%28Souvenir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09fa9a4986242583b5ce1ab9b314b5de3f273895","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,250,154,73,134,36,37,131,181,206,26,185,179,20,181,222,63,39,56,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
