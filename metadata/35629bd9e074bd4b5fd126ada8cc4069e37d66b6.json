As the squad car drove him away, he confessed he had strangled 15 young men. \nIt wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just the crimes that stunned; it was also the way he spoke. Nilsen said he had loved the young men he killed. His words seemed bizarre. When newspapers carried stories of how the 37-year-old lured men back to his flat and why, the nation was shocked by his sheer evil. Yet some psychiatrists considered him a man of rare, complex, and extreme psychological problems. In addition, none of them had met a killer who seemed so keen to understand his own psyche. \nWhilst on remand in Brixton Prison, Nilsen filled 55 exercise books with thoughts. During his subsequent thirty years in prison he has continued to write, most notably on the first draft of a multi-volume autobiography. The Home Office has now banned it, calling the work pornographic and outrageous. Only one journalist has read the book. Using exclusive access to NilsenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writing and extensive independent research, Russ Coffey explains what Nilsen says and how much of it we can believe. This is a shocking glimpse into the mind of a killer.\n\n-Description from The Good Nurse:\nAfter his December 2003 arrest, registered nurse Charlie Cullen was quickly dubbed &quot;The Angel of Death&quot; by the media. But Cullen was no mercy killer, nor was he a simple monster. He was a favorite son, husband, beloved father, best friend, and celebrated caregiver. Implicated in the deaths of as many as 300 patients, he was also perhaps the most prolific serial killer in American history.\nCullen's murderous career in the world's most trusted profession spanned sixteen years and nine hospitals across New Jersey and Pennsylvania. When, in March of 2006, Charles Cullen was marched from his final sentencing in an \nAllentown, Pennsylvania, courthouse into a waiting police van, it seemed certain that the chilling secrets of his life, career, and capture would disappear with him. Now, in a riveting piece of investigative journalism nearly ten years in the making, journalist Charles Graeber presents the whole story for the first time. Based on hundreds of pages of previously unseen police records, interviews, wire-tap recordings and videotapes, as well as exclusive \njailhouse conversations with Cullen himself and the confidential informant who helped bring him down, THE GOOD NURSE weaves an urgent, terrifying tale of murder, friendship, and betrayal.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35629bd9e074bd4b5fd126ada8cc4069e37d66b6","amp;dn":"True+Crime+Collection+2013+%5BEpub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35629bd9e074bd4b5fd126ada8cc4069e37d66b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,98,155,217,224,116,189,75,95,209,38,173,168,204,64,105,227,125,102,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
