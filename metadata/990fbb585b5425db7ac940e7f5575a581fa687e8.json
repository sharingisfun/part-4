The presentation of topics is made with an effort to be clear and concise so that the book is portable and user friendly. Inorganic Chemistry 2E is divided into five major themes (structure, condensed phases, solution chemistry, main group and coordination compounds) with several chapters in each. There is a logical progression from atomic structure to molecular structure to properties of substances based on molecular structures, to behavior of solids, etc. The author emphasizes fundamental principles-including molecular structure, acid-base chemistry, coordination chemistry, ligand field theory, and solid state chemistry -and presents topics in a clear, concise manner. There is a reinforcement of basic principles throughout the book. For example, the hard-soft interaction principle is used to explain hydrogen bond strengths, strengths of acids and bases, stability of coordination compounds, etc. The book contains a balance of topics in theoretical and descriptive chemistry.\n\nNew to this Edition:\n\n    New and improved illustrations including symmetry and 3D molecular orbital representations\n    Expanded coverage of spectroscopy, instrumental techniques, organometallic and bio-inorganic chemistry\n    More in-text worked-out examples to encourage active learning and to prepare students for their exams\n\n\n\n. Concise coverage maximizes student understanding and minimizes the inclusion of details students are unlikely to use.\n. Discussion of elements begins with survey chapters focused on the main groups, while later chapters cover the elements in greater detail.\n. Each chapter opens with narrative introductions and includes figures, tables, and end-of-chapter problem sets.\n\nPublisher: Academic Press; 2 edition (November 13, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0123851106\nISBN-13: 978-0123851109\n\nEditorial Reviews\nReview\n\n&quot;Each chapter is well referenced and includes plenty of homework problems.for those advanced students who have completed physics and calculus, this would be an excellent resource for obtaining a thorough coverage of inorganic chemistry.Summing Up: Highly recommended.&quot;--CHOICE, August 2013 &quot;In a textbook for a one-semester upper-level introductory course in inorganic chemistry, House.selects topics to provide essential information in the major areas of the field such as atomic and molecular structure, condensed phases, acid-base chemistry and solvents, coordination chemistry, ligand field theory, and solid-state chemistry.&quot;--Reference and Research Book News, February 2013\nFrom the Back Cover\nInorganic Chemistry\nJames E. House, Illinois Wesleyan University and Illinois State University, USA\n\nInorganic chemistry is a broad, rapidly developing field that includes theoretical, physical, and synthetic topics. If organic chemistry is defined as the chemistry of hydrocarbon compounds and their derivatives, then inorganic chemistry can be described as the chemistry of &quot;everything else.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ This includes all of the remaining elements in the periodic table as well as carbon, which plays a major role in many inorganic compounds.\n\nWritten for a one-semester inorganic chemistry course, this textbook provides essential information for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students and for individuals pursuing self-study. The author presents the major areas of inorganic chemistry in a clear, concise manner and incorporates pedagogy that reflects his extensive experience teaching the course.\n\n. Concise coverage maximizes student understanding, and extensive visuals-including original figures and tables-show the broad applicability of important principles.\n. The book features a logical organization with five major sections: atomic and molecular structure, condensed phases, solution chemistry, chemistry of the elements, and chemistry of coordination compounds.\n. Students can review and retain the material through the use of chapter introductions, references for further study, and end-of-chapter questions and problems.\n\nAdditional resources are available on the companion website at http://elsevierdirect.com/companions/9780123567864","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:990fbb585b5425db7ac940e7f5575a581fa687e8","amp;dn":"%5BJames+House%5DInorganic+Chemistry%2C+Second+Edition%28pdf%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"990fbb585b5425db7ac940e7f5575a581fa687e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,15,187,88,91,84,37,219,122,201,64,231,245,87,90,88,31,166,135,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
