It parodies the romanticised, sometimes doom-laden accounts of rural life popular at the time, by writers such as Mary Webb. Gibbons was working for the Evening Standard in 1928 when they decided to serialise Webb's first novel, The Golden Arrow, and Gibbons was given the job of summarising the plot of earlier instalments. Other novelists in the tradition parodied by Cold Comfort Farm are D. H. Lawrence, Sheila Kaye-Smith and Thomas Hardy; and going further back, Mary E Mann and the BrontÃ« sisters. Cold Comfort Farm won the Femina Vie Heureuse Prize for 1933. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 88 on the BBC's survey The Big Read","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f25fa715668481c3197d793fa5f0c2f2c62b201b","amp;dn":"Cold+Comfort+Farm+-+Stella+Gibbons.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f25fa715668481c3197d793fa5f0c2f2c62b201b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,95,167,21,102,132,129,195,25,125,121,63,165,240,194,242,198,43,32,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
