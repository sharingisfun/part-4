Stallings emphasizes both design issues and fundamental principles in contemporary systems and gives readers a solid understanding of the key structures and mechanisms of operating systems. He discusses design trade-offs and the practical decisions affecting design, performance and security. The book illustrates and reinforces design concepts and ties them to real-world design choices through the use of case studies in UNIX and Windows.\n\nOperating Systems: Internals and Design Principles, 6e received the 2009 Textbook Excellence Award from the Text and Academic Authors Association (TAA)!\n\n\n# Hardcover: 816 pages\n# Publisher: Prentice Hall; 7 edition (March 10, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 013230998X\n# ISBN-13: 978-0132309981\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b45df68e601d3cd94345ce7c5bd2aa7e4a991ffd","amp;dn":"Operating+Systems%3AInternals+and+Design+Principles%2C7th+Ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b45df68e601d3cd94345ce7c5bd2aa7e4a991ffd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,93,246,142,96,29,60,217,67,69,206,124,91,210,170,126,74,153,31,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
