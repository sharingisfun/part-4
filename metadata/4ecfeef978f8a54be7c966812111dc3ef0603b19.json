Because to offer you anything less would suggest I had not grown, changed, or evolved these past fifteen years. I am not the same teacher I was when I wrote the first edition.&quot;\n-Jim Burke\n\nThe fourth edition of English Teacher's Companion is 100 percent new. Jim Burke has rewritten it to model methods for reaching a new generation of students-when all the ground rules for teaching are changing.\n\nA teacher's teacher and a recognized leader in English/language arts education, Jim understands the need for instructional methods that connect the why of teaching to the how. &quot;This edition makes the research behind my practice more explicit,&quot; he writes. &quot;It is also anchored in the Common Core State Standards, because I am still teaching every day-so these standards are my standards too.&quot;\n\nWeaving in ideas for working with ELLs, struggling readers, and technology, English Teacher's Companion, Fourth Edition:\n\nlooks comprehensively at the research and reality of our profession, our students, and our content\nprovides practical and thoughtful methods for meeting standards in reading, writing, speaking and listening, and language study\nmakes assessment a priority, not only to find out what students know but to help practitioners improve.\n\n&quot;I have taught English for nearly 25 years, and I love it,&quot; writes Jim Burke. Never has this love been more apparent than in the numerous lessons and teaching moves he includes as well as in the many examples of his own classroom language. Trust the fourth edition of English Teacher's Companion, and bring the passion, power, and practicality of one of America's best teachers to your classroom.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ecfeef978f8a54be7c966812111dc3ef0603b19","amp;dn":"The+English+Teacher%27s+Companion%2C+4E-+Burke+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ecfeef978f8a54be7c966812111dc3ef0603b19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,207,238,249,120,248,165,75,231,201,102,129,33,17,220,62,240,96,59,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
