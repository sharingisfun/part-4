Writing in a delightfully personal and down-home style, Green emphasizes the point that herbal medicine-making is fundamental to every culture on the planet and is accessible to everyone. So, first head into the garden and learn to harvest your own herbs, and then head into your kitchen and whip up a batch of raspberry cough syrup, or perhaps a soothing elixir to erase the daily stresses of modern life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bc18dc6e0aec71875a72022321dccfe26616d64","amp;dn":"47+Simple+Herbal+Remedies%2C+Antibiotics+And+Medicine-Maker%27s+Hand","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bc18dc6e0aec71875a72022321dccfe26616d64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,193,141,198,224,174,199,24,117,167,32,34,50,29,204,254,38,97,109,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
