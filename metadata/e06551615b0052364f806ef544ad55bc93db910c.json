Evans , who studied flute through his college years, rarely recorded with a flutist ( Jeremy Steig joined him on a later record for Verve), though he was fond of the instrument; the capable Chuck Israels on bass and drummer Paul Motian round out the trio. The low-key &quot;Willow Weep for Me&quot; and impressionist composer Erik Satie 's Gymnopedie bring out the lyricism of Mann 's playing, though the trio's backing is very understated. Things open up a bit with a sparkling take of Cole Porter 's &quot;I Love You.&quot; Mann 's two originals, &quot;Nirvana&quot; and &quot;Cashmere,&quot; aren't quite as memorable; substituting one of Evans ' compositions for either of them might have provided some additional spark. Still, fans of either Herbie Mann or Bill Evans will want to acquire this enjoyable set","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e06551615b0052364f806ef544ad55bc93db910c","amp;dn":"a-ha+-+Hunting+High+and+Low+%5BFlac%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e06551615b0052364f806ef544ad55bc93db910c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,101,81,97,91,0,82,54,79,128,110,245,68,173,85,188,147,219,145,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
