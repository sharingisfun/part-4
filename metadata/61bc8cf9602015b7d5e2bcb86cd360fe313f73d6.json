Start making cheese at home today by Cole Dawson\n\n2012 | ISBN: 1935484303 | English | 176 pages | EPUB | 33 MB\n\nFrom the editors of Hobby Farm Homes, Cheese It! provides a detailed introductory guide for making cheese at home, from easy-to-make soft cheeses like mozzarella, goat cheese, and cottage cheese to more challenging cheeses like Monterey Jack, parmesan, and aged gouda. Author Cole Dawson tackles four dozen different kinds of cheese, beginning with making butter, ghee, and sour cream from scratch and progressing to soft unripe cheeses such as paneer, chÃƒÂ¨vre, ricotta, and feta. International in its scope, each subsequent chapter tackles different kinds of cheeses, the tricks to success, and examples and recipes for each.\n\nThe chapter on unripe cheeses is followed by stretched curds, incorporating the brine bath to make mozzarella, asadero, provolone, and scamorza. Pressing and aging semi-hard cheese yield traditional Cheddar and variations, such as sage derby and goat Cheddar, plus Cantal, Monterey Jack, Cotswold, Caerphilly, and Caciotta. The process of washing curds to reduce the acidic level is the key creating cheeses like Colby, Gouda, and Edam, while washing rinds along with proper aging are the secrets to muenster, brick, raclette, Taleggio, and Tilsit. Using bacteria in cheese is key to making bloomy rinds, such as the triple-cream delights Camembert and Brie, and molded cheese, such as gorgonzola, Roquefort, and Stilton","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61bc8cf9602015b7d5e2bcb86cd360fe313f73d6","amp;dn":"Cheese+It%21+Start+making+cheese+at+home+today+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61bc8cf9602015b7d5e2bcb86cd360fe313f73d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,188,140,249,96,32,21,183,213,226,188,184,108,211,96,254,49,63,115,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
