Ever since, he and his wife have drifted apart, fracturing a once normal life. Cal is mired in grief, a grief he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t move past. And maybe his grief has clouded his judgment. Because driving home one night, he makes his first big mistake.\n\nA girl drenched in rain taps on his car window and asks for a ride as he sits at a stoplight. Even though he knows a fortysomething man picking up a teenage hitchhiker is a fool, he lets her in. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the same age as Scott, and maybe she can help Cal find the dealer who sold his son the drugs that killed him. After a brief stop at a roadside diner, Cal senses that somethingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not right with the girl or the situation. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too late. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s already involved.\n\nNow Cal is drawn into a nightmare of pain and suspicion. Something is horribly wrong in the small town of Griffon in upstate New York. There are too many secrets there, too many lies and cover-ups. And Cal has decided to expose those secrets one by one.\n\nThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s his second big mistake.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready. Metadata is complete and up to date.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a48e7e4ea825a6edfeceffcd898abe2f65f6ad91","amp;dn":"A+Tap+on+the+Window+by+Linwood+Barclay+%28ePub+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a48e7e4ea825a6edfeceffcd898abe2f65f6ad91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,142,126,78,168,37,166,237,254,206,255,205,137,138,190,47,101,246,173,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
