Sacco spent this time meeting with Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the narrative focuses on the minute details of everyday life in the occupied territories, presenting the daily struggles, humiliations and frustrations of the Palestinians.\n\nSaccoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s visit to Israel and the occupied territories is presented chronologically, from his arrival to his departure, through dramatic scenes with only a handful of diversions to present the historical and personal background. Most of the scenes in the book are conversations between Sacco and Palestinians, and though the events they talk about are presented visually the dialogue is always present as a form of narration for the events.\n\nSacco devotes whole pages to drawings of the destitution and squalor prevalent in the occupied territories. Though Sacco is the principle narrator at times he steps aside and allows other characters to present their stories uninterrupted and without interpretation. In his drawings, though most of the panels are presented as a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œside viewÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of Sacco, other characters and their surroundings, there are several panels which present the scene as it looks from SaccoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s point of view. There are also panels which present a birdÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eye view of places like the refugee camps or Jerusalem.\n\nIn Palestine Sacco positions himself knowingly as the westerner going to the Middle East to confront a reality unfamiliar to his American audience. Sacco does not delude himself that as a &quot;neutral&quot; observer he can remain invisible and have no effect on the events around him, instead accepting his role and concentrating on his personal experience of the situation. Though his goal is to document events and interview Palestinians he is affected by the reality of the occupied territories and cannot help but participate in, and comment on, demonstrations, funerals, roadblocks and encounters with soldiers. Towards the end he becomes even more active as he shares food and lodgings with the Palestinians he interviews and even breaks curfew with them while in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn the book Sacco references Joseph Conrad&amp;#039;s Under Western Eyes, Apocalypse Now, and Edward Said&amp;#039;s Orientalism to draw links between the situation he is witnessing and colonialism. Towards the end of the book Sacco acknowledges that he has not reflected Israel enough, that it would take a whole other trip to present that side of things.\n\n\nSeed and enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df7066a72240c812815ce8e332b5e5b2d586b82d","amp;dn":"Palestine-Joe+Sacco+%28excellent+graphic+novel%21%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df7066a72240c812815ce8e332b5e5b2d586b82d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,112,102,167,34,64,200,18,129,92,232,227,50,181,229,178,213,134,184,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
