(You only need one of these methods).\n\n\nCompressed with 7Zip, Game was tested and works.\n\n\nNote: No Ps1 Backup/Game or copy will work unless you have a modded Ps1/Ps2, or if \n      you use a bootdisc like Breaker Pro. You can also use a Game Enhancer/Built-\n      in Mod-Chip which does the same as Breaker Pro expect you have to have any \n      original ps1 game loaded first (loads the boot code) then you swap in \n      your backup &amp; start the game. \n\n\n\n\nGame Description:\n\nBeat the pulp out of your opponent using this fantasy lineup of Capcom Street Fighter characters and Marvel X-Men comic book characters in this conversion of the arcade game. The arcade giant returns with all of the characters and moves, with all the animation intact including the option to swap characters on the fly. This title required the 4 meg ram cart that shipped with it (although there were a few released without it), but once running, was practically arcade perfect. Zero loading times after the initial start-up load screen, and then instantly into the action. \n\n\nGame Pics Included.\n\n\nBurn With Alcohol 120% (Included in Download).\n\nSet DataType to Playstation (Write Method Raw/Dao) and burn at 8x speed.\n\nUse Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden CD Media for best quality, or if other media isn't working.\n\n(No CD-RW will not work).\n\n\nAny Problems or Questions Please Post a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7 do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e6c8c26c360fe65f7c5bed952af968ebd9c0da1","amp;dn":"%5BPsx%5D+X-Men+Vs.+Street+Fighter+%5BNtsc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e6c8c26c360fe65f7c5bed952af968ebd9c0da1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,108,140,38,195,96,254,101,247,197,190,217,82,175,150,142,189,156,13,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
