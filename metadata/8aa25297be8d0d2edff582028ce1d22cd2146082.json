While ubiquitous hits such as &quot;Walking on Broken Glass&quot; and &quot;Sing&quot; are included here, it's great that the set's compilers thought to add non-full-length selections such as &quot;Love Song for a Vampire&quot; to this mix. Her stellar covers such as the reading of Procol Harum's &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; and the Freeman-Hughes standard &quot;No More &quot;I Love You's&quot; are in the mix as well, making this a very well-rounded collection.\nAll Music Review by Thom Jurek  \n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Little Bird\n[02] Walking On Broken Glass\n[03] Why\n[04] No More ''I Love You's''\n[05] Precious\n[06] A Whiter Shade Of Pale\n[07] A Thousand Beautiful Things\n[08] Sing\n[09] Pavement Cracks\n[10] Love Song For A Vampire\n[11] Cold\n[12] Dark Road\n[13] Pattern Of My Life\n[14] Shining Light\n\nPlay Time - 01h:02m:04s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 406mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
