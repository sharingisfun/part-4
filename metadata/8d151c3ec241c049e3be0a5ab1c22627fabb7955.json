They were rock &amp; roll crusaders during an era of synthesized pop and heavy metal, equally known for their sweeping sound as for their grandiose statements about politics and religion. The Edge provided the group with a signature sound by creating sweeping sonic landscapes with his heavily processed, echoed guitars. Though the Edge's style wasn't conventional, the rhythm section of Larry Mullen, Jr. and Adam Clayton played the songs as driving hard rock, giving the band a forceful, powerful edge that was designed for arenas. And their lead singer, Bono, was a frontman with a knack of grand gestures that played better in stadiums than small clubs. It's no accident that footage of Bono parading with a white flag with &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; blaring in the background became the defining moment of U2's early career -- there rarely was a band that believed so deeply in rock's potential for revolution as U2, and there rarely was a band that didn't care if they appeared foolish in the process. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\n\n\n01.Helter Skelter\n02.Van Diemen's Land\n03.Desire\n04.Hawkmoon 269\n05.All Along The Watchtower\n06.I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\n07.Freedom For My People\n08.Silver And Gold\n09.Pride (In The Name Of Love)\n10.Angel Of Harlem\n11.Love Rescue Me\n12.When Love Comes To Town\n13.Heartland\n14.God Part II\n15.The Star Spangled Banner\n16.Bullet The Blue Sky\n17.All I Want Is You\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d151c3ec241c049e3be0a5ab1c22627fabb7955","amp;dn":"U2+-+Rattle+And+Hum+%281988%29+%5BCD+Rip%5D+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d151c3ec241c049e3be0a5ab1c22627fabb7955","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,21,28,62,194,65,192,73,227,190,10,90,177,194,38,39,250,187,121,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
