It begins uninnocently enough, arming up, then moving to intent, and finally motive: &quot;Maybe you'll be holding her hand/ Or watching her shitty band,&quot; she snarls, drawing out &quot;band&quot; in a way that displays the full plumage of her disgust. She strums slowly, unfancily, as she recounts a lover's bed-hopping betrayal. Then there's the shot-- &quot;HA!&quot; and a grunge-glorious bridge with the big reveal, &quot;She took your love away from me/ And I am thankful.&quot; She wants him back as much as she wants him gone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1d028b458fc0f86fb884b9db9131e3ac5965c32","amp;dn":"Scout+Niblett+-+It%27s+Up+to+Emma+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1d028b458fc0f86fb884b9db9131e3ac5965c32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,208,40,180,88,252,15,134,251,136,75,157,185,19,30,58,197,150,92,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
