Any structure can be built at any time, provided that your people have collected the resources to do so. There is no money. Instead, your hard-earned resources can be bartered away with the arrival of trade vessels. These merchants are the key to adding livestock and annual crops to the townspeopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s diet; however, their lengthy trade route comes with the risk of bringing illnesses from abroad.\n\n1.Install the game\n2.Play","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17a92e97f282730a853d4e16a54a79f04a2644b4","amp;dn":"Banished+v1.0.4-GOG%09","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17a92e97f282730a853d4e16a54a79f04a2644b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,169,46,151,242,130,115,10,133,61,78,22,165,74,121,240,74,38,68,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
