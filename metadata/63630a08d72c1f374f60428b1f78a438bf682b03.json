It's intended for users\nwith multiple computers on their desk since each system uses its\nown display.\n\nRedirecting the mouse and keyboard is as simple as moving the mouse\noff the edge of your screen.  Synergy also merges the clipboards of\nall the systems into one, allowing cut-and-paste between systems.\nFurthermore, it synchronizes screen savers so they all start and stop\ntogether and, if screen locking is enabled, only one screen requires\na password to unlock them all.\n\nSynergy is open source and released under the GNU Public License (GPL).\n\nPlease see doc/index.html for more information.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63630a08d72c1f374f60428b1f78a438bf682b03","amp;dn":"Synergy+Lets+you+share+your+keyboard+and+mouse+with+several+OS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63630a08d72c1f374f60428b1f78a438bf682b03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,99,10,8,215,44,31,55,79,96,66,139,31,120,164,56,191,104,43,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
