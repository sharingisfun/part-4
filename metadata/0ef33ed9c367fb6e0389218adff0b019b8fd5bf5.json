More than thirty years after its initial \n\npublication, it remains every bit as relevant today.\n\nWritten by the late, beloved Dr. George Sheehan, Running &amp; Being tells of the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s midlife return to the world of exercise, play and competition, in which he found Ã¢â‚¬Å“a world \n\nbeyond sweatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that proved to be a source of great revelation and personal growth. But Running &amp; Being focuses more on life than it does, specifically, on running. It provides an \n\noutline for a lifetime program of fitness and joy, showing how the body helps determine our mental and spiritual energies.\n\nDrawing from the words and actions of the great athletes and thinkers throughout history, Sheehan ties it all together with his own philosophy on the importance of fitness and \n\nsport, as well as his knowledge of training, injury prevention, and race competition. Above all, Sheehan describes what it means to experience the oneness of body and mind, of \n\nself and the universe. In this, Sheehan argues, we have the power to discover Ã¢â‚¬Å“the truth that makes men free.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ef33ed9c367fb6e0389218adff0b019b8fd5bf5","amp;dn":"Running+%26amp%3B+Being-+George+Sheehan+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ef33ed9c367fb6e0389218adff0b019b8fd5bf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,243,62,217,195,103,251,110,3,137,33,138,223,240,176,25,184,253,91,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
