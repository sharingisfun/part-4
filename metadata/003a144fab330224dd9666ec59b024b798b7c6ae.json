It was the band's first completely self-produced album, and the first not to feature producer Roy Thomas Baker. Recorded at Sarm East, The Manor and Wessex Studios in England, A Day at the Races was engineered by Mike Stone. The title of the album followed suit with its predecessor A Night at the Opera in taking its name from a film by the Marx Brothers.\n\nIn recent years, a number of publications have cited A Day at the Races as one of the band's finest works. The album peaked at #1 in the UK, Japan and the Netherlands. It reached #5 on the US Billboard 200 and was Queen's fifth album to ship gold in the US, and subsequently reached platinum status in the same country.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot;   \tBrian May \t4:48\n02. \t&quot;You Take My Breath Away&quot;   \tFreddie Mercury \t5:09\n03. \t&quot;Long Away&quot;   \tMay \t3:34\n04. \t&quot;The Millionaire Waltz&quot;   \tMercury \t4:54\n05. \t&quot;You and I&quot;   \tJohn Deacon \t3:25\n06. \t&quot;Somebody to Love&quot;   \tMercury \t4:56\n07. \t&quot;White Man&quot;   \tMay \t4:59\n08. \t&quot;Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy&quot;   \tMercury \t2:54\n09. \t&quot;Drowse&quot;   \tRoger Taylor \t3:45\n10. \t&quot;Teo Torriatte (Let Us Cling Together)&quot;   \tMay \t5:50\n\n2011 Universal Records reissue bonus disc\n\n01. \t&quot;Tie Your Mother Down (Backing Track Mix 2011)&quot;   \t3:48\n02. \t&quot;Somebody to Love (Live at Milton Keynes, June 1982)&quot;   \t7:55\n03. \t&quot;You Take My Breath Away (Live in Hyde Park)&quot;   \t3:06\n04. \t&quot;Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy (Top of the Pops, July 1977)&quot;   \t2:51\n05. \t&quot;Teo Torriatte (Let Us Cling Together) (HD Mix)&quot;   \t4:47","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:003a144fab330224dd9666ec59b024b798b7c6ae","amp;dn":"Queen+-+A+Day+At+The+Races+%5Bwith+BONUS+EP%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"003a144fab330224dd9666ec59b024b798b7c6ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,58,20,79,171,51,2,36,221,150,102,236,89,176,36,183,152,183,198,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
