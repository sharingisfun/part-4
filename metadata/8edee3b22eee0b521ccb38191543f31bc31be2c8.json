You don't need to crack or patch anything - I've pre-cracked it.\n\n3) My repack of ALL game DLCs weights LESS (!) than official installer for DLC &quot;Legacy&quot;. Mine weights 812 megabytes and contains all DLCs, while &quot;Legacy&quot; installer weights 844 megabytes. Mine also installs faster because it does not unpack into &quot;Temp&quot; folder.\n\n\n\nFrom the Readme:\n\n\nDragon Age II DLC Pack includes the following DLCs:\n\n- Black Emporium\n- Legacy\n- Mage Item Pack\n- Pre-Order Bonus Items\n- Ring of Whispers\n- Rogue Item Pack\n- Signature Edition Items\n- The Antivan Garrote\n- The Exiled Prince\n- Warrior Item Pack\n\nThe DLC Pack also patches your game to version 1.03.\n\nNotes:\n\n* You may (depending on an Act you are playing) need to access your Special Deliveries chest twice in order to obtain Signature Edition and Pre-Order Bonus Items. Which means that you will need to exit the house, and return again.\n* In order to have the Mabari war hound in your party, you need to open the character's ability tree, and drag the Summon Mabari icon to your on-screen ability quick-access list.\n\n\n***Access &quot;Legacy&quot; DLC through a statue in your house!***\n\n\nP.S. Seems F-Secure anti-virus started detecting *all* of my installers as trojans again. Don't know why, don't care. Maybe Avira too. I suggest you either sort this problem out with the developers, or switch to a better anti-virus.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8edee3b22eee0b521ccb38191543f31bc31be2c8","amp;dn":"Dragon+Age+2+Complete+DLC+Re-Pack+%28+WITH+LEGACY+and+Patch+1.03%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8edee3b22eee0b521ccb38191543f31bc31be2c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,222,227,178,46,238,11,82,28,203,56,25,21,67,243,27,195,27,226,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
