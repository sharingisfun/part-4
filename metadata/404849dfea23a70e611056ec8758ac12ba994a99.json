Crease, Alfred Scharff Goldhaber\nNarrated by: Sean Runnette\nLength: 9 hrs and 32 mins\nUnabridged Audiobook\nRelease Date:10-13-14\n\nThe fascinating story of how quantum mechanics went mainstream.\n\nThe discovery of the quantum - the idea, born in the early 1900s in a remote corner of physics, that energy comes in finite packets instead of infinitely divisible quantities - planted a rich set of metaphors in the popular imagination.\n\nQuantum imagery and language now bombard us like an endless stream of photons. Phrases such as multiverse, quantum leap, alternate universe, the uncertainty principle, and SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger's cat get reinvented continually in cartoons and movies, coffee mugs and T-shirts, and fiction and philosophy - phrases reinterpreted by each new generation of artists and writers.\n\nIs a quantum leap big or small? How uncertain is the uncertainty principle? Is this barrage of quantum vocabulary pretentious and wacky or a fundamental shift in the way we think?\n\nAll of the above, say Robert P. Crease and Alfred Scharff Goldhaber in this groundbreaking book. The authors - one a philosopher, the other a physicist - draw on their training and six years of co-teaching to dramatize the quantum's rocky path from scientific theory to public understanding. Together, they and their students explored missteps, mistranslations, jokes, and gibberish in public discussions of the quantum. Their book explores the quantum's manifestations in everything from art and sculpture to the prose of John Updike and David Foster Wallace. The authors reveal the quantum's implications for knowledge, metaphor, intellectual exchange, and the contemporary world. Understanding and appreciating quantum language and imagery, and recognizing its misuse, is part of what it means to be an educated person today.\n\nThe result is acelebration of language at the interface of physics and culture, perfect for anyone drawn to the infinite variety of ideas","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:404849dfea23a70e611056ec8758ac12ba994a99","amp;dn":"The+Quantum+Moment+-+Crease+and+Goldhaber++-+Audiobook+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"404849dfea23a70e611056ec8758ac12ba994a99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,72,73,223,234,35,167,14,97,16,86,236,135,88,172,18,186,153,74,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
