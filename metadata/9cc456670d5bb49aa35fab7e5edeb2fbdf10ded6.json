This book introduces you to the C programming language, reinforcing each programming structure with a simple demonstration of how you can use C to control the Arduino family of microcontrollers. Author Jack Purdum uses an engaging style to teach good programming techniques using examples that have been honed during his 25 years of university teaching.\nBeginning C for Arduino will teach you:\nThe C programming language\nHow to use C to control a microcontroller and related hardware\nHow to extend C by creating your own library routines\nDuring the course of the book, you will learn the basics of programming, such as working with data types, making decisions, and writing control loops. You'll then progress onto some of the trickier aspects of C programming, such as using pointers effectively, working with the C preprocessor, and tackling file I / O. Each chapter ends with a series of exercises and review questions to test your knowledge and reinforce what you have learned.\nWhat you'll learn:\nThe syntax of the C programming language as defined for the Arduino\nTried and true coding practices (applicable to any programming language)\nHow to design, code, and debug programs that drive Arduino microcontrollers\nHow to extend the functionality of C\nHow to integrate low cost, off-the-shelf, hardware shields into your own projects.\n\nTitle: Beginning C for Arduino\nAuthor: Jack Purdum\nPublisher: Apress\nYear: 2012\nFormat: PDF\n\n\n\n2010kaiser home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
