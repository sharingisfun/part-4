Do you have trouble achieving that wonderful, chewy-crunchy crust that you get at a pizzeria? Have you made good pizza, but find that you are unable to do it consistently? Have you looked at pizza cookbooks and baking stones in the store, but did not have the guts to try making pizza, yourself? Worse yet, do you have a pizza pan or a pizza stone that is sitting in your cupboard gathering dust because you have never made a pizza that is good enough to justify all the effort. Passionate About Pizza: Making Great Homemade Pizza is what you need!\nThink of the best pizza you ever had. Do you wish that you could have that pizza again, maybe even all the time? If you are lucky, you can get great pizza locally. However, if you are like most people, you just cannot seem to find the memorable pizza you want. If you live on the east coast, there are not very many Chicago-style or California-style pizzerias around. If you have moved away from New York City (or even upstate New York), you can only find great New York-style pizza in your memories. Well, if you cannot buy it, you can certainly make it. If you can buy it, you can certainly make one that is better!\n\nWith a little practice and some guidance from this book, you can make pizza better than any pizza you have made before. It can be better than any store-bought or restaurant pizza you will ever find. Moreover, your homemade pizza will be great, every time.\n\nThis comprehensive pizza cookbook will ignite your passion and help you make great homemade pizza!\n\n- contains 256 full color pages\n- over 300 color pictures guide you each step of the way\n- 14 dough recipes\n- 10 sauce recipes\n- learn to make 17 different styles of pizza\n- 35 easy-to-follow pizza-making techniques\n- 65 recipes in all!\n- helps you consistently make great pizza every time\n- tips on Having a Pizza Party\n- Troubleshooting Guide with simple solutions to common problems\nPassionate About Pizza: Making Great Homemade Pizza has three parts to encourage you along the journey of becoming a better pizza maker.\n\nPart One starts walking you through a systematic approach to making consistently good pizza by introducing the Passionate About Pizza System, and then further develops the system in subsequent chapters focused on detailed discussions of every aspect of making a pizza. Even the most practiced pizza chef will get some benefit (and enjoyment, I hope) from reading the chapters in part one.\n\nPart Two covers recipes and has chapters listing dough and sauce recipes that you can use for any type of pizza. One chapter for each of the major types of pizza follows. Each of these chapters has detailed recipes for each of the common styles of one type.
