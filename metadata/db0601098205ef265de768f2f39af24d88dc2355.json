(Single)2016 ak320\r\n\r\nBrujeria is an extreme metal band formed in Tijuana, Mexico in 1989. Their name comes from the Spanish word for &quot;witchcraft&quot;. Their songs, which are sung entirely in Spanish, are focused on Satanism, anti-Christianity, sex, immigration, narcotics smuggling, politics and also include lyrics about killing white people (despite having a vast majority of white members in the band).\r\nBrujeria are  a side-project of guitarist Dino Cazares (founding member of Fear Factory), and has featured  Billy Gould, Nicholas Barker, Raymond Herrera, Jeff Walker and Shane Embury. They portray themselves as a Latino band consisting of drug lords, concealing their identities due to being wanted by the FBI.\r\n\r\nDeath\r\nSubgenre:\tDeath Metal / GoreGrind\r\nBitrate:\t320ak\r\nSize:\t13.13 MB\r\n \t\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01,Viva Presidente Trump! 3:30\r\n\r\n02,Pared De Muerte 2:12 \r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent members :\r\nJuan Brujo (John Lepe) - vocals (1989-Present)\r\nPinche Peach - vocals, samples (1989-present)\r\nFantasma (Pat Hoed) - vocals, bass (1989-Present)\r\nEl Cynico (Jeffrey Walker) - bass (2006-Present)\r\nHongo (Shane Embury) - guitar (formerly bass) (1989-Present)\r\nPodrido (Adrian Erlandsson) - drums (2006-Present)\r\nPititis (Gaby Dominguez) - backing vocals, guitar\r\n\r\nPast members :\r\nAsesino (Dino Cazares) - guitar (1989-2005)\r\nHongo Jr. (Nicholas Barker) - drums (2000-2005)\r\nGÃ¼ero Sin Fe (Billy Gould) - bass, guitar (1989-2002)\r\nGreÃ±udo (Raymond Herrera) - drums (1993-2002)\r\nEl Angelito (Tony Laureano) - drums (2006-)\r\nEl Embrujado (Patrik Jensen)- guitar (1997-)\r\nCristo de Pisto (Jesse Pintado) - guitar (2000)\r\nEl Sadistico (Emilio Marquez) - drums\r\nJr. Hozicon - director\r\nMarijuana Machete (Antonio Hernandez) - vocals, electronics, samples","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db0601098205ef265de768f2f39af24d88dc2355","amp;dn":"Brujeria+-+Viva+Presidente+Trump%21+%28Single%292016+ak320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db0601098205ef265de768f2f39af24d88dc2355","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,6,1,9,130,5,239,38,93,231,104,242,243,154,242,77,136,220,35,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
