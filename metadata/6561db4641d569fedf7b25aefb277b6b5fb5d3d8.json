It seems that most Seger fans are unaware of this CD released from 2003. I hope somebody with this retail CD will be kind and produce a FLAC version of this album for all of us audio purists to enjoy in perfect audio quality. Again, it is well worth purchasing $$$ if you can afford it and enjoy it. If I was not unemployed you can bet I would order this CD in a heartbeat. All songs are included and encoded in 192kbps MP3. I can not stress enough how eager Bob's fans await a CD to FLAC Conversion upload, as this current economy has many of us hurting.\n\nThis CD can be purchased from Amazon.com for a little more than $8.97 + postage.\nWhen I get back on my feet I will order this CD, as it is well worth it for 16 of Bob's best songs plus a music video for computer play. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Bob-Seger-Greatest-Hits-2/dp/B0000DG05T&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Bob-Seger-Greatest-Hits-2/dp/B0000DG05T&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIt is my hope that everyone that enjoys this CD and can afford it will consider ordering the Retail CD from Amazon.com or otherwise purchase this CD if you can find it. Bob Seger is often overlooked as the Rock icon he really is.\n\nMy personal favorite hits of Seger's is on this CD Vol #2 (NOT on Vol #1!) There is no comparison to Vol #1. Vol #2  deserves a FLAC upload of which I can not provide without using mp3s for the source, which defeats the purpose. Or perhaps an upload that also includes Track 17- Turn The Page VIDEO.\n\nNOTE: This is my first attempt at making a torrent so I trust somebody will advise me if there are any problems with this upload. \n\nThis album reflects just how diverse Seger really is and shows many different styles in can write/produce and play/sing. I believe most Rock fans will Cherish this upload, if for not anything else for Bob's diverse genres of styles reflected within this collection.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTrack listing\n______________\n______________\n\n\nMajority of songs written and composed by Bob Seger.\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNo.      Title\n\n\n1. \t&quot;Understanding&quot; (from the film Teachers)\n\t  \n2. \t&quot;The Fire Down Below&quot;  \n \t  \t\n3. \t&quot;Her Strut&quot;   \t  \t\n\n4. \t&quot;Beautiful Loser&quot;   \t\n  \t\n5. \t&quot;Sunspot Baby&quot;   \n\t  \t\n6. \t&quot;Katmandu&quot;   \t  \t\n\n7. \t&quot;Shame on the Moon&quot;   \n\n8. \t&quot;Fire Lake&quot;   \t  \t\n\n9. \t&quot;Tryin' To Live My Life Without You&quot; (live) \n\t\n10. \t&quot;Shakedown&quot; (from the film Beverly Hills Cop II)\n\n11. \t&quot;Manhattan&quot;   \n\t  \t\n12. \t&quot;New Coat of Paint&quot; \n\t\n13. \t&quot;Chances Are (with Martina McBride)&quot; (from the film Hope Floats) \n\t  \t\n14. \t&quot;Rock and Roll Never Forgets&quot;  \n \t  \n15. \t&quot;Satisfied&quot; (previously unreleased) \t\n  \t\n16. \t&quot;Tomorrow&quot; (previously unreleased) \n\n\t  \t\nNote: The Retail CD Contained a version of the classic TURN THE PAGE in VIDEO FORMAT. However it is not included in this MP3 package.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis collection is in 192kbps, which many will be fine with. However after hearing the FLAC version of Vol #1 it is my hopes that a music collector with Vol #2 will rip and produce a high quality FLAC upload.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nAgain, if you are not unemployed like me, please consider buying it from wherever you can find the retail disc for sale.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6561db4641d569fedf7b25aefb277b6b5fb5d3d8","amp;dn":"Bob+Seger%5C%27s+Greatest+Hits+2+-+2003","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6561db4641d569fedf7b25aefb277b6b5fb5d3d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,97,219,70,65,213,105,254,223,123,37,174,251,39,123,107,95,181,211,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
