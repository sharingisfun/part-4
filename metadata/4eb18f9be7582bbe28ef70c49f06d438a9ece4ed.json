With her MBA newly in hand, she has her future figured outÃ¢â‚¬â€move up at the nightclub she works at and stay away from any guy who might trigger her obsessive love disorder. A perfect plan.\n\nBut what Alayna didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t figure on is Hudson Pierce, the new owner of the nightclub. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s smart, rich, and gorgeousÃ¢â‚¬â€the kind of guy Alayna knows to stay away from if she wants to keep her past tendencies in check. Except, HudsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fixed his sights on her. He wants her in his bed and makes no secret of it.\n\nAvoiding him isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t an option after he offers a business proposition she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t turn down and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drawn further into his universe, unable to resist his gravitational pull. When she learns Hudson has a dark history of his own, she realizes too late that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fallen for the worst man she could possibly get involved with. Or maybe their less than ideal pasts give them an opportunity to heal each other and finally find the love their lives have been missing.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4eb18f9be7582bbe28ef70c49f06d438a9ece4ed","amp;dn":"Fixed+on+You+%28Fixed+%231%29+by+Laurelin+Paige+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4eb18f9be7582bbe28ef70c49f06d438a9ece4ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,177,143,155,231,88,43,190,40,239,112,196,159,6,212,56,169,236,228,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
