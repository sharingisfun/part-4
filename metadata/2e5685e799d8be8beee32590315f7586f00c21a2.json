The content added here over the coming updates will house all the customization, item crafting, dinosaur knowledgebase etc.\n\nI have not tested this on a server yet to see if it will connect. Please leave info in comments if it will for other users. Also i will seed this as long as i can but not to long i am afraid.\n\nCredits\n\n- Where i found the update.
