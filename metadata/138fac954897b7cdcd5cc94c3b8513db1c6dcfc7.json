Like his previous album, the politically topical and somewhat abrasive Some Time in New York City, Mind Games was poorly received by music critics. It reached number 13 in the UK and number 9 in the US, where it went gold. The album was recorded at Record Plant Studios, and was produced solely by Lennon.\n\nThe album was recorded at the beginning of Lennon's 18-month separation from Yoko Ono.\n\nTrack Listing **** 2010 Remaster **** [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Mind Games&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:13\n    &quot;Tight A$&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:37\n    &quot;Aisumasen (I'm Sorry)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:44\n    &quot;One Day (At a Time)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:09\n    &quot;Bring on the Lucie (Freeda Peeple)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:12\n    &quot;Nutopian International Anthem&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 0:03\n    &quot;Intuition&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:08\n    &quot;Out the Blue&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:23\n    &quot;Only People&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:23\n    &quot;I Know (I Know)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:49\n    &quot;You Are Here&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:08\n    &quot;Meat City&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:45\n\n\n**** The John Lennon Signature Box is an 11-disc box set of remastered John Lennon albums and new collections, released on CD and digital format, as part of the &quot;Gimme Some Truth&quot; collection.
