Each chapter is consistently organized beginning with a brief study of surface anatomy followed by concise coverage of osteology, presenting important foundational structures that will aid in localization of soft tissue structures. Each dissection unit begins with a &quot;Dissection Overview&quot; providing a guide of what is to be accomplished during the dissection session. This is followed by &quot;Dissection Instructions,&quot; with a logical sequence and numbered steps for the dissection. Each dissection concludes with a &quot;Dissection Review&quot; that presents a numbered lists of tasks illustrating the important features of the dissection and encouraging the synthesis of information. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1621384619c4e2d0e4596e17ec7d7bc30f1861b","amp;dn":"Grant%27s+Dissector+15th+Ed.+%5Btahir99%5D+VRG.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1621384619c4e2d0e4596e17ec7d7bc30f1861b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,98,19,132,97,156,78,45,14,69,150,225,126,199,215,188,48,241,134,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
