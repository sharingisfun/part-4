As a youth, Corky was kicked out of his Mafia-connected family for being an oddball. Now his long-lost father (Peter Falk) has been indicted and needs Corky to infiltrate the FBI and steal the government's evidence against him. Corky is willing to aid the relatives who so long ago turned their backs on him, but his brothers go overboard when intimidating the computer hacker who gets Corky's bogus application into the FBI academy, presenting him as a super agent named Pissant. Now Corky must live up to his reputation for an eminently qualified top cop while simultaneously trying to get the goods on his dad. Corky Romano co-stars Peter Berg, Chris Penn, Vincent Pastore, Vinessa Shaw, Fred Ward, and Richard Roundtree.\n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 25 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea6d5e3dd7e86acd165a417030a4278316ce6a52","amp;dn":"Corky+Romano%282001%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea6d5e3dd7e86acd165a417030a4278316ce6a52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,109,94,61,215,232,106,205,22,90,65,112,48,164,39,131,22,206,106,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
