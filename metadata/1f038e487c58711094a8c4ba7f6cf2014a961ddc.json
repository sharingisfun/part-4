The real answer will probably surprise you. In our culture, which emphasizes group work from elementary school through the business world, everything seems geared toward extroverts. Luckily, introverts everywhere have a new spokesperson: Susan Cain, a self-proclaimed introvert whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s taken it upon herself to better understand the place of introverts in culture and society. With Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Stop Talking, Cain explores introversion through psychological research old and new, personal experiences, and even brain chemistry, in an engaging and highly-readable fashion. By delving into introversion, Cain also seeks to find ways for introverts and extroverts to better understand one another--and for introverts to understand their own contradictions, such as the ability to act like extroverts in certain situations. Highly accessible and uplifting for any introvert--and any extrovert who knows an introvert (and over one-third of us are introverts)--Quiet has the potential to revolutionize the Ã¢â‚¬Å“extrovert ideal.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œMalissa Kent ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f038e487c58711094a8c4ba7f6cf2014a961ddc","amp;dn":"Quiet_+The+Power+of+Introverts+in+a+Worl+-+Susan+Cain.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f038e487c58711094a8c4ba7f6cf2014a961ddc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,3,142,72,124,88,113,16,148,168,196,186,127,108,242,1,74,150,29,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
