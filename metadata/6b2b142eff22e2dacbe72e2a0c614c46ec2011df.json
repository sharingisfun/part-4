Rosemary (Mia Farrow) is a young, trusting housewife whose actor husband (John Cassavetes), has literally made a deal with the devil. In the thrall of a witches' coven headquartered in their apartment building, the young husband arranges to have his wife impregnated by Satan in exchange for success in a Broadway play. To Rosemary, the pregnancy seems like a normal and happy one--that is, until she grows increasingly suspicious of her neighbors' evil influence.\n\n  Starring: Mia Farrow, John Cassavetes, Ruth Gordon, Sidney Blackmer, Maurice Evans.\n\n  Directed by: Roman Polanski.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 2hr. 11min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 688 x 432","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b2b142eff22e2dacbe72e2a0c614c46ec2011df","amp;dn":"Rosemary%5C%27s+Baby+%281968%29+%28Mia+Farrow%2C+John+Cassavetes%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b2b142eff22e2dacbe72e2a0c614c46ec2011df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,43,20,46,255,34,226,218,203,231,46,42,12,97,76,70,236,32,17,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
