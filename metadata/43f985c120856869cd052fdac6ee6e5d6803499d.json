Modifications. Accessories. Tactical Shotgun is the essential guide to selecting and using a shotgun for defense. Whether your concern is self-defense, home defense or law enforcement, author Scott Wagner's advice will help you make informed decisions. Here he offers an experienced point of view on many makes and models of tactical shotguns, along with information on ammunition and the many accessories available. Find out: What is a &quot;tactical&quot; shotgun? Pump action, semi-auto or double? What's the best choice for home defense? Which features are valued by law enforcement? Wagner also reviews some fun specialty ammo (learn which exotic load promised quite a show, but ultimately fizzled), and performs some very revealing backyard ballistics testing.\n\n\nBy Scott W.
