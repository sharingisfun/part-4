The resortÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s singular purpose of providing a good time to its visitorsÃ¢â‚¬â€whether lawful or notÃ¢â‚¬â€demanded a single mentality to rule the town. Success of the local economy was the only ideology, and critics and do-gooders werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t tolerated.\n\nBy 1900, a political juggernaut, funded by payoffs from gambling rooms, bars, and brothels, was firmly entrenched. For the next 70 years, Atlantic City was dominated by a partnership comprised of local politicians and racketeers. This unique alliance reached full bloom in the person of Enoch &quot;Nucky&quot; ThompsonÃ¢â‚¬â€the second of three bosses to head the Republican machine that dominated city politics and society.\n\nIn Boardwalk Empire, Nucky Thompson, Louis &quot;the Commodore&quot; Kuehnle, Frank &quot;Hap&quot; Farley, and Atlantic City itself spring to life in all their garish splendor. Author Nelson Johnson traces &quot;AC&quot; from its humble beginnings as Jonathan PitneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seaside health resort, through the notorious backroom politics and power struggles, to the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s astonishing rebirth as an entertainment and gambling mecca where anything goes.\n\nBoardwalk Empire is a colorful, irresistible history of a unique city and culture. Here is proof positive that truth is stranger and more compelling than fiction.\n\nimageimage\n\nimage ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42d521ff40abb753e56f773d7164c71f91c80304","amp;dn":"Boardwalk+Empire+Season+4+-+COMPLETE+720p+x264+%5BMKV%2CAC3%2C5.1%5D+Ehh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42d521ff40abb753e56f773d7164c71f91c80304","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,213,33,255,64,171,183,83,229,111,119,61,113,100,199,31,145,200,3,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
