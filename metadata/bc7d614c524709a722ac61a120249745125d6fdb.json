This time, we decided to have William fly down to Austin and hang out with us during our rehearsal process. By day heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d sit and watch us rehearse the full-band versions of the songs in preparation for our recording session; by night IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d play him the songs acoustically and talk about the places and people that inspired them, and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d talk about visual ideas for the artwork.\nA week and a half or so after heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d returned to Warren, William sent me the beautiful central gatefold Ã¢â‚¬Å“mapÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ image of my town circa 1986, based on all the discussions weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d had and e-mails weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d sent back and forth. I was astounded by the scope and detail and tenderness of the piece. It is my single favorite piece heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever done for us. I had giant print-outs made of it and I hung it on the wall at the studio where the vocals and overdubs were recorded. In the past I always felt like WilliamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s artwork communicated with the music in some way, but with this record I wanted that communication to go both ways; I wanted the music to communicate with the artwork as well. While I would sing these songs or play the instrumental parts IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d look at the image hanging from the wall: I wanted to to feel like all of the music was pouring out of this picture.&quot;\n\n- Will Sheff\n\nIF YOU LOVE IT, BUY IT.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc7d614c524709a722ac61a120249745125d6fdb","amp;dn":"Okkervil+River+-+The+Silver+Gymnasium+%282013%29+%5B320kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc7d614c524709a722ac61a120249745125d6fdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,125,97,76,82,71,9,167,34,172,97,161,32,36,151,69,18,93,111,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
