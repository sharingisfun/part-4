Readily available\r\ninternet technology allows virtually anyone to trade on an equal footing with the\r\n'big players'. In fact, the days of large financial institutions 'having an edge' are\r\nlong gone. You can now see what they see as they see it. You can take the same\r\ntrades they take. But you have one very big advantage... you're small!\r\n\r\nThe 'big players' need to buy and sell in large volumes. You don't.Trading just one or two contracts,from the comfort of your own home,can make you money while they're\r\nstill thinking about it. It's easier than you probably think. The great thing about using trading as your key to financial freedom is the opportunity it allows you to\r\npursue your hobbies and spend time with family and friends.\r\n\r\nA day trader's life really is a smorgasbord of opportunities. Full time traders can\r\nchoose their markets and their times. Part-time traders can choose their markets\r\nto fit in with their existing careers. Many traders simply start at 6:00am, trade for\r\ntwo hours, then go and spend time in the garden, play golf or have lunch with\r\nfriends and then return for another hour or two in the evening","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eed5c863e8c3b4f355f14855e0fc61320594d344","amp;dn":"Day+Trading+Video+Tutorials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eed5c863e8c3b4f355f14855e0fc61320594d344","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,213,200,99,232,195,180,243,85,241,72,85,224,252,97,50,5,148,211,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
