Greatest Hits offers the basic canon, with no frills and none of Young's trademark idiosyncracies, but ultimately that doesn't matter much, because Greatest Hits has all the songs that every Neil Young fan agrees are his biggest and best: &quot;Down by the River,&quot; &quot;Cinnamon Girl,&quot; &quot;Helpless,&quot; &quot;After the Gold Rush,&quot; &quot;Southern Man,&quot; &quot;Ohio,&quot; &quot;The Needle and the Damage Done,&quot; &quot;Old Man,&quot; &quot;Heart of Gold,&quot; &quot;Like a Hurricane.&quot; It works as an introduction for the uninitiated and as a concise summary for more casual fans. In other words, it's as good a compilation as it could have been.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:889363d25fc8eb44db1bb926bbf98c62e321aea3","amp;dn":"Neil+Young+-+Greatest+Hits+%282004%29+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"889363d25fc8eb44db1bb926bbf98c62e321aea3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,147,99,210,95,200,235,68,219,27,185,38,187,249,140,98,227,33,174,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
