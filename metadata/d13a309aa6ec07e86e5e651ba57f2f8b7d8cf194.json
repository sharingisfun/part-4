How about trying something different? How about going for lasting wealth - and doing it the cautious way? In Get Rich Carefully, Jim Cramer uses his thirty-five years of experience as a Wall Street veteran and host of CNBC's Mad Money to create a guide to high-yield, low-risk investing. In our recovering economy, this is the plan you need to make big money without taking big risks.\n\nDrawing on his unparalleled knowledge of the stock market and on the mistakes and successes he's made on the way to his own fortune, Cramer explains - in plain English - why you can get rich in a prudent, methodical way, as long as you start now. In his own inimitable style, Cramer lays it on the line, no waffling, no on-the-one-hand-or-the-other hedging, just the straight stuff you need to accumulate wealth. This is a book of wisdom as well as specifics. Cramer names names, highlights individual and sector plays, and identifies the best long-term investing themes - and shows you how to develop the disciplines you need to exploit them. \n\nAuthor:\n\nJames J. Cramer is the host of CNBC's Mad Money with Jim Cramer and co-host of Squawk on The Street. He serves on TheStreet, Inc., board of directors, is a columnist and contributor for TheStreet's RealMoney and ActionAlerts PLUS, and participates in various video segments for TheStreet TV.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d13a309aa6ec07e86e5e651ba57f2f8b7d8cf194","amp;dn":"Get+Rich+Carefully+%282013%29+By+Jim+Cramer+%28epub%2Cmobi%2Cazw3%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d13a309aa6ec07e86e5e651ba57f2f8b7d8cf194","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,58,48,154,166,236,7,232,110,94,101,27,165,127,47,139,125,140,241,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
