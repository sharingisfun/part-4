The book will not be a comprehensive \nsolution to all problems facing new system administrators, but instead is a \ntutorial introduction to the process of learning about and maintaining a \nrunning Unix server.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ff079a153267ab195d5a2ac678c3658cc743446","amp;dn":"Sams+Teach+Yourself+UNIX+System+Administration+in+24+Hours++%7B+W-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ff079a153267ab195d5a2ac678c3658cc743446","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,240,121,161,83,38,122,177,149,213,162,172,103,140,54,88,204,116,52,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
