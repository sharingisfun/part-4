Let Hollywood legend and Kill Bill star David Carradine guide you through this introduction to Tai Chi. The masters of Tai Chi believed that development of the body without the mind was dangerous and that cultivating the mind and body establising perfect unity between thought, action and health. AM - Tai Chi For The Mind-This workout is gentler, utilising stretching, deep breathing, slow flowing movements and the mental visualisations to strengthen and relax the mind and body. The moves are designed to affect the subtler levels of your energy. You will actually feel more energised after the workout than before, preparing you for the day. PM - Tai Chi For The Body This workout is more intense and physical than the AM workout. The stances are lower, promoting more muscular development. The moves are designed to greatly enhance Chi flow thereby energetically cleansing the body of the tension and stress accumulated throughout the day.\n\nVideo; x264; 704*578 (4:3); 2484 kbps; 25.000 fps\nAudio; aac; 160 kbps; 2 ch; 48.0 Khz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5bc8c21daf74d4468f7ea77b1b54504ccfdfec1","amp;dn":"Introduction+for+Beginners+to+AM+PM+Tai+Chi+with+David+Carradine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5bc8c21daf74d4468f7ea77b1b54504ccfdfec1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,188,140,33,218,247,77,68,104,247,234,119,177,181,69,4,204,253,254,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
