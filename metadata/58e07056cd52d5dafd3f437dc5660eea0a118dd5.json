I Am The Light\n\nThe White Buffalo (Jake Smith) recently played a stellar performance at Bonnaroo and is riding an increasingly steady wave of word-of-mouth due to his consistent touring. Compared to artists from Ray Lamontagne to Eddie Vedder to Johnny Cash for his guitar-focused authentic songwriting, The White Buffalo has honed his craft in the bars and clubs whose characters inspired much of his music. He just wrapped a string of west coast tour dates previewing material from his forthcoming full length album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Once Upon A Time In The WestÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (due out October 25th, 2011 via Unison Music Group). The Portland Mercury said this about his new albumÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“On his forthcoming LP Once Upon a Time in the West [The White Buffalo] comes across as a weathered hero, a singer with a husky voice and a whiskey slur trying to right some wrongs along the way. He'll drink you under the table, then break a chair over your back, and you'll love every moment of it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58e07056cd52d5dafd3f437dc5660eea0a118dd5","amp;dn":"The+White+Buffalo+-+Once+Upon+A+Time+In+The+West+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58e07056cd52d5dafd3f437dc5660eea0a118dd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,224,112,86,205,82,213,218,253,63,67,125,197,102,14,234,10,17,141,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
