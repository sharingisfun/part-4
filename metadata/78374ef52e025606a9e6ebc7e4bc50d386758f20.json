What you need is a single resource that not only explains the biochemical underpinnings of metabolic medicine, but also integrates laboratory findings with clinical practice. You will find all this, and more, in the eighth edition of Clinical Biochemistry and Metabolic Medicine.\n\nThis well-respected text provides comprehensive and measured guidance to this complex area, reflecting the ongoing changes in our understanding of clinical biochemistry while preserving the acknowledged strengths of previous editions: readability, a firm basis in the underlying science, and a clear focus on clinical applicability.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78374ef52e025606a9e6ebc7e4bc50d386758f20","amp;dn":"Clinical+Biochemistry+and+Metabolic+Medicine%2C+8E-+Crook+%5BPDF%5D+%5BS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78374ef52e025606a9e6ebc7e4bc50d386758f20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,55,78,245,46,2,86,6,169,230,235,199,228,188,80,211,134,117,143,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
