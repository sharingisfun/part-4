I have never uploaded a torrent before, but downloaded these off the Lynda website, and just had to share them. \nI hope this freaking works this time. \n\nIn this course, photographer and author Ben Long details the features, controls, and options in the Canon 5D Mark III digital SLR. The course begins with an overview of what a digital SLR is and takes a tour of the camera's basic components. Ben then discusses the camera's basic operation: changing lenses, navigating the menus, shooting in automatic mode, reviewing and managing photos on the camera's LCD screen, and transferring photos to a computer.\n\nNext, the course introduces more advanced exposure options: program mode, exposure compensation, ISO adjustments, and more. After Ben briefly defines each option, he shows how to adjust it using the camera's controls.\n\nBen also discusses white balance options, advanced metering and autofocus controls, flash, live view, and video shooting. The course ends with a chapter on maintenance, including sensor- and camera-cleaning and care tips.\nTopics include:\n\n    What is a DSLR?\n    Attaching lenses\n    Powering up and down\n    Formatting the media card\n    Holding the camera\n    Shooting in the Auto and Program modes\n    Changing the ISO\n    Controlling autofocus and white balance\n    Using a self-timer\n    Working with the exposure control options\n    Activating Live Vi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7795e6add348b140ecb66dab6fd0ad20f854ef83","amp;dn":"Lynda+Shooting+with+the+Canon+5D+Mark+III+with+Ben+Long+WORKS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7795e6add348b140ecb66dab6fd0ad20f854ef83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,149,230,173,211,72,177,64,236,182,109,171,111,208,173,32,248,84,239,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
