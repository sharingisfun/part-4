White Chalks haunted piano ballads seemed to emanate from an isolated manse on a moor, but here Harvey chronicles her relationship with her homeland through songs revolving around war. Throughout the album, she subverts the concept of the anthem -- a love song to oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s country -- exploring the forces that shape nations and people. This isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t the first time Harvey has been inspired by a place, or even by England: she sang the praises of New York City and her home county of Dorset on Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea. Harvey recorded this album in Dorset, so the setting couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be more personal, or more English. Yet she and her longtime collaborators John Parish, Mick Harvey, and Flood travel to the Turkish battleground of Gallipoli for several of Let England Shakes songs, touching on the disastrous World War I naval strike that left more than 30,000 English soldiers dead. Her musical allusions are just as fascinating and pointed: the title track sets seemingly cavalier lyrics like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLets head out to the fountain of death and splash aboutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to a xylophone melody borrowed from the Four LadsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIstanbul (Not Constantinople),ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a mischievous echo of the questions of national identity Harvey sets forth in the rest of the album (that she debuted the song by performing it on the BBCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s The Andrew Marr Show for then-Prime Minster Gordon Brown just adds to its mischief). ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Words That Maketh MurderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ culminates its grisly playground/battleground chant with a nod to Eddie Cochrans anthem for disenfranchised ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“50s teens ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSummertime Blues,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ while ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWritten on the ForeheadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ samples Nineys ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlood and FireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to equally sorrowful and joyful effect. As conceptually and contextually bold as Let England Shake is, it features some of Harveys softest-sounding music. She continues to sing in the upper register that made White Chalk so divisive for her fans, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tempered by airy production and eclectic arrangements -- fittingly for such a martial album, brass is a major motif -- that sometimes disguise how angry and mournful many of these songs are. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Last Living RoseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ recalls Harveys Dry-era sound in its simplicity and finds weary beauty even in her homelandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgrey, damp filthiness of ages,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEngland,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ she wails, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou leave a taste/A bitter one.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ In its own way, Let England Shake may be even more singular and unsettling than White Chalk was, and its complexities make it one of HarveyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most cleverly crafted works.\n\nReleased: Feb 15, 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Alternative\nQuality: Lossless\nCodec: FLAC\n\n Tracks:\n  \n  1.
