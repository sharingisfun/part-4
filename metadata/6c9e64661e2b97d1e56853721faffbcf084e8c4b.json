Donnelly\nASM Press | April 2014 | ISBN-10: 1555815863 | PDF | 350 pages | 19.1 mb\n\nA scientific overview of the association of microbes with cheese, through the lens of select cheese varieties that result due to surface mold ripening, internal mold ripening, rind washing, cave aging, or surface smear rind development.\nOver the past decade, there has been explosive growth in the U.S. artisan cheese industry. The editor, Ms. Donnelly, was involved in developing a comprehensive education curriculum for those new to cheese making, which focused on the science of cheese, principally to promote cheese quality and safety. Many of the chapters in this book focus on aspects of that requisite knowledge.\n-    Explains the process of transformation of milk to cheese and how sensory attributes of cheese are evaluated.\n-    Provides an overview of cheese safety and regulations governing cheese making, both in the US and abroad, to ensure safety.\n-   Explores how the tools of molecular biology provide new insights into the complexity of the microbial biodiversity of cheeses.\n-   Examines the biodiversity of traditional cheeses as a result of traditional practices, and overviews research on the stability of the microbial consortium of select traditional cheese varieties.\n-    Key text for cheese makers, scientists, students, and cheese enthusiasts who wish to expand their knowledge of cheeses and traditional foods.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s29.postimg.org/t2rw40klz/catherine.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s29.postimg.org/t2rw40klz/catherine.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nFood Safety Expert Catherine W. Donnelly, Ph. D is a professor of nutrition and food science at the University of Vermont. She also serves as the associate  director for the Vermont Institute for Artisan Cheese. She serves the AOAC Research Institute as a Performance Tested Methods reviewer and is the scientific editor of the food microbiology and safety section of the Journal of Food Science.\n\nCONTENTS\nContributors vii\nPreface xi\n1.
