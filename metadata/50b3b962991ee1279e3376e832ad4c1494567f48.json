The book is perfectly suited for specialists interested in the corrosion resistance and mechanisms of these materials. \n\nFollowing a general introduction to the composition, properties, and applications of polymers, the book focuses on the effects of chemical corrosion caused by changes in temperature, moisture, and other corrodents. Organized by material type, the chapters cover each material's ability to withstand sun, weather, and ozone as well as its chemical resistance and typical applications. The book also includes compatibility tables for each of the materials and compares the corrosion resistance of selected elastomers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50b3b962991ee1279e3376e832ad4c1494567f48","amp;dn":"Corrosion+of+Polymers+and+Elastomers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50b3b962991ee1279e3376e832ad4c1494567f48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,179,185,98,153,30,225,39,158,51,118,232,50,173,76,20,148,86,127,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
