Each of these games is a true battle, with the result often in doubt until near the very end of the struggle.\n\nNunn identifies the most common causes of the errors that lead to the loser's demise, and how one can seek to take dramatic advantage of the opponent's risky or faulty play. In his thought-provoking extended introduction, he explains that in many cases, the problem was of a psychological nature: often the loser fails to accept that events have not unfolded according to plan, and as a consequence steers into the reefs when there was still time to head for safer waters.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Grandmaster-Secrets-Winning-Quickly-Chess/dp/1904600891/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373693540&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=winning+quickly+chess&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Grandmaster-Secrets-Winning-Quickly-Chess/dp/1904600891/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373693540&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=winning+quickly+chess&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24d103c2bd8f576dec674af6243b9f2a15d53e26","amp;dn":"Grandmaster+Secrets%3A+Winning+Quickly+at+Chess","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24d103c2bd8f576dec674af6243b9f2a15d53e26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,209,3,194,189,143,87,109,236,103,74,246,36,59,159,42,21,213,62,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
