They have been recognized by music critics and metal fans a like for combining a harsh sound with a high level of technical skill.\nOrigin's music is characterized by almost exclusive use of several specific, difficult playing techniques: blast beats on the drum kit, multiple death growled vocals,and arpeggios and sweep picking on both the guitars and the bass guitar. Their songs often have uneven, shifting time signatures. In spite of Origin's obscurity, the extremity of their music, and their lack of an official website, in 2008 they scored a minor American hit with the release of their fourth studio album, Antithesis.\n\nYear: 2014\nCountry: United States\nGenre: Technical Brutal Death Metal\nCodec: Mp3\nBitrate: 320kbps\n\n01.
