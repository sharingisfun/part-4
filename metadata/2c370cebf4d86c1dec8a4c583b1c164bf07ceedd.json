The name for the band was chosen, according to founding member Txus, because &quot;life is a yellow brick road, on which we walk in the company of others searching for our dreams.&quot;\n\nIn 1992, the band were finalists in the Villa de Madrid contest. Then they went onto achieve great success in Spain, and in 1995, were declared Revolution Rock Band. Around 1996, the band's definitive line-up began to emerge; that same year, they began recording the rock opera CD, JesÃƒÂºs de ChamberÃƒÂ­, which was produced by Alberto Plaza and MÃƒÂ¤go de Oz. The CD was released in 1996, through their former label, Locomotive Music.\n\nIlussia is the thirteenth studio album by the Spanish folk metal band MÃƒÂ¤go de Oz. It was released on October 21, 2014\n\n\n\nBand Members\n\nTxus Di Fellatio\tDrums\nCarlitos\tGuitars (rhythm)\nMohamed\tViolin\nFrank\tGuitars (rhythm)\nPatricia Tapia\tVocals (female)\nJosema\tWind instruments\nFernando Mainer Bass\nJavier DÃƒÂ­ez\tKeyboards, Guitars (live)\nZeta\tVocals (lead)\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nMÃƒÂ¤go De Oz (1994)\nJesÃƒÂºs De ChamberÃƒÂ­ (1996)\nLa Leyenda De La Mancha (1998)\nFinisterra (2000)\nGaia (2003)\nBelfast (2004)\nGaia II: La Voz Dormida (2005)\nLa Ciudad De Los Ãƒï¿½rboles (2007)\nGaia III: Atlantia (2010)\nGaia: EpÃƒÂ­logo (2010)\nHechizos, PÃƒÂ³cimas Y BrujerÃƒÂ­a (2012)\nIlussia (2014)\n\n\n\nIlussia (2014)\n\n\n\n01.
