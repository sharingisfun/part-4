They are mainly known for their unusual amalgamation of metalcore and pop punk as a musical style. The band consists of vocalist Jeremy McKinnon, rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Neil Westfall, bassist Joshua Woodard, percussion and drummer Alex Shelnutt and lead guitarist Kevin Skaff.\n\nSigning with Indianola for their first album, And Their Name Was Treason (2005), Scruggs was replaced by Shelnutt in 2006. Later that year the band recorded For Those Who Have Heart (2007) for Victory. They embarked on several tours of the UK and U.S. and played at several festivals, before recording and releasing Homesick (2009). While promoting Homesick on tour, Denney was replaced by Skaff. Soon after releasing their next album, What Separates Me from You (2010), the band went on a worldwide tour to promote it. In 2011, the band was involved in a lawsuit with Victory over their recording contract, which was settled in October 2013. The band released their fifth album, Common Courtesy (2013), the same month.\n\nStudio Albums Included\n2005 - And Their Name Was Treason\n2007 - For Those Who Have Heart\n2009 - Homesick\n2010 - What Separates Me From You\n2013 - Common Courtesy\n\nPlease Seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f92082c6a70782bac1489f914824c834533f74d","amp;dn":"A+Day+To+Remember+Discography+2005-2013+No+EPs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f92082c6a70782bac1489f914824c834533f74d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,146,8,44,106,112,120,43,172,20,137,249,20,130,76,131,69,51,247,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
