In the United States, the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) broadcast it as part of its &quot;Great Performances&quot; series, introduced by the Canadian journalist Robert MacNeil, who explained the workings of SIS.\n\nThe title credits feature a matryoshka doll progressively revealing a doll more irate than the previous, with the final doll being faceless, an allusion to Winston ChurchillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s describing Russia as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigmaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½; analogously, the literary George Smiley concludes that only Karla saw the last doll in the British traitor. The closing credits music, an arrangement of Nunc dimittis (&quot;Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace&quot;) from the Book of Common Prayer (1662), was composed by Geoffrey Burgon for organ, trumpet and treble; the score earned the Ivor Novello Award for 1979.\n\nIn the United States, subsequent syndicated broadcasts and DVD releases compressed the seven British episodes into six, in which scenes were shortened and the narrative sequence altered. In the British original, Smiley visits Connie Sachs before Peter Guillam's burglary of the Circus, while the US version reverses the sequence of these events.\n\nCast:\n\nGeorge Smiley ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Alec Guinness\nPeter Guillam ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Michael Jayston\nOliver Lacon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Anthony Bate\nToby Esterhase ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Bernard Hepton\nBill Haydon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ian Richardson\nJim Prideaux ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ian Bannen\nRicki Tarr ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hywel Bennett\nPercy Alleline ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Michael Aldridge\nRoy Bland ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Terence Rigby\nControl ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Alexander Knox\nMendel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ George Sewell\nConnie Sachs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Beryl Reid\nJerry Westerby ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Joss Ackland\nAnn Smiley ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ SiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢n Phillips\nRoddy Martindale ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Nigel Stock\nKarla ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Patrick Stewart\nSam Collins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ John Standing\nTufty Thessinger ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Thorley Walters\nMolly Purcell ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Mandy Cuthbert\nAlwyn ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Warren Clarke\nIrina ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Susan Kodicek\nFawn ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Alec Sabin\nBoris ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hilary Minster\nPolyakov ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ George Pravda\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJumboÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Roach ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Duncan Jones\nMrs Pope Graham ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Pauline Letts\nHeadmaster ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ John Wells\nLauder Strickland ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Frank Moorey\nBryant ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Frank Compton\nAlisa Brimley ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Marjorie Hogan\nPaul Skordeno ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Joe Praml\n\nSpecs:\n\n290 min / UK:350 min (7 parts)\nCountry: UK\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: English\nColor: Color\nAspect Ratio: 1.33 : 1 more\nSound Mix: Mono\n\nEpisode list (SPOILERS):\n\nEpisode 1: Return to the Circus\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½10 September 1979\nRetired espionage veteran George Smiley is called out on a top secret mission: to uncover a Soviet agent within MI6's echelons.\n\nEpisode 2: Tarr Tells His Story\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½17 September 1979\nA British agent, who was thought to have defected, resurfaces with sensational information - confirmation of a Russian spy mole existing in the Service.\n\nEpisode 3: Smiley Tracks the Mole\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½24 September 1979\nThe investigation begins, with Peter Guillam burgling the archives for information, while Smiley visits an old comrade whose past knowledge could prove vital to locating the spy.\n\nEpisode 4: How It All Fits Together\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½1 October 1979\nWhile Guillam and Tarr come under pressure, Smiley recounts his one meeting with the Soviet master spy Karla, who is undoubtedly running the spy inside MI6.\n\nEpisode 5: Tinker Tailor\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½8 October 1979\nSmiley goes to meet Jim Prideaux who is now back in Britain having survived his experience in Czechoslovakia.
