Nakasone, S. Yoshimoto and T.A. Stolarski\nLanguage\tEnglish\nPages\t\t480\nDescription\tFor all engineers and students coming to finite element analysis or to ANSYS software for the first time, this powerful hands-on guide develops a detailed and confident understanding of using ANSYS's powerful engineering analysis tools. \n\t\tThe best way to learn complex systems is by means of hands-on experience. With an innovative and clear tutorial based approach, this powerful book provides readers with a comprehensive introduction to all of the fundamental areas of engineering analysis they are likely to require either as part of their studies or in getting up to speed fast with the use of ANSYS software in working life. \n\t\tOpening with an introduction to the principles of the finite element method, the book then presents an overview of ANSYS technologies before moving on to cover key applications areas in detail.\n\t\tKey topics covered:\n\t\tIntroduction to the finite element method\n\t\tGetting started with ANSYS software\n\t\tstress analysis \n\t\tdynamics of machines \n\t\tfluid dynamics problems\n\t\tthermo mechanics \n\t\tcontact and surface mechanics\n\t\texercises, tutorials, worked examples \n\n\t\tWith its detailed step-by-step explanations, extensive worked examples and sample problems, this book will develop the reader's understanding of FEA and their ability to use ANSYS's software tools to solve their own particular analysis problems, not just the ones set in the book.\n\n\t\t* Develops a detailed understanding of finite element analysis and the use of ANSYS software by example \n\t\t* Develops a detailed understanding of finite element analysis and the use of ANSYS software by example \n\t\t* Exclusively structured around the market leading ANSYS software, with detailed and clear step-by-step instruction, worked examples, and detailed, screen-by-screen illustrative problems to reinforce learning\nLinks &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780750668750&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780750668750&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://books.google.com/books/about/Engineering_Analysis_with_ANSYS_Software&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://books.google.com/books/about/Engineering_Analysis_with_ANSYS_Software&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6a64f52a9cca1c2133e388ce83624032686bad2","amp;dn":"Engineering+Analysis+with+ANSYS+Software+Y.+Nakasone%2C+S.+Yoshimo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6a64f52a9cca1c2133e388ce83624032686bad2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,166,79,82,169,204,161,194,19,62,56,140,232,54,36,3,38,134,186,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
