The focus is on Baker&amp;#039;s strong point -- romantic but gospel-influenced R&amp;B/pop ballads and &quot;slow jams,&quot; sometimes with jazz overtones -- and letting her be true to herself. Rapture gave Baker one moving hit after another, including &quot;Sweet Love,&quot; &quot;Caught up in the Rapture,&quot; &quot;Same Ole Love,&quot; and &quot;No One in This World.&quot; Praising Baker in a 1986 interview, veteran R&amp;B critic Steve Ivory asserted, &quot;To me, singers like Anita Baker and Frankie Beverly define what R&amp;B or soul music is all about.&quot;\n\nRapture&amp;#039;s tremendous success made it clear that there was still a sizeable market for adult-oriented, more traditional R&amp;B singing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70e0cd94b33bb2a05e2e316b28ecf7001a3e255c","amp;dn":"Anita+Baker+-+Rapture+-+1986","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70e0cd94b33bb2a05e2e316b28ecf7001a3e255c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,224,205,148,179,59,178,160,94,46,49,107,40,236,247,0,26,62,37,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
