Will you succumb to madness and cannibalism on the black waters? Or return home triumphant with a hold full of precious loot? Events can turn out differently every game - sometimes, even if you make the same choices. Will you lose your sweetheart to a curse? Redeem, betray or consume the Genial Magician? Sell your soul to the Wistful Deviless or spurn her advances? Is the Dawn Machine your salvation, or your doom?\nYou are the captain. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your call.\n\n\nFeatures:\n==========\n\n- A deep, compelling world packed with 200,000+ words of stories and secrets.\n- Light and dark. Stray too far from the gas-lamps of civilisation and your crew will grow fearful and eventually lose their sanity. But there is treasure out there in the darknessÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n- Beautiful, hand drawn art - castles of sparkling ice, prisons perched on lily pads, fog-shrouded lighthouses and the DAWN MACHINE. \n- Upgrade your steamship with powerful engines, flensing cannons, and pneumatic torpedo guns. Or just buy a bigger, better ship.\n- Hire unique officers like the Haunted Doctor and the Irrepressible Cannoneer. Each has a story to tell, if you can draw it out of them.\n- Choose from a menagerie of shipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mascots: the Comatose Ferret, the Wretched Mog, the Elegiac Cockatoo, and more!\n- Trade silk and souls, mushroom wine, and hallucinogenic honey.\n\n\nVersion: \n==========\n\nv1.0.2.2029 or GOG setup v2.3.0.4 from 18th March 2015\n\n\nVersion changes:\n=================\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.failbettergames.com/magellan-and-the-stuttering-bug/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.failbettergames.com/magellan-and-the-stuttering-bug/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nInstructions:\n==============\n\nIt's a GOG version, just launch setup\nClick options to chose location and accept EULA, install \nPlay - Enjoy - Seed - give me what I need\nSpeed!
