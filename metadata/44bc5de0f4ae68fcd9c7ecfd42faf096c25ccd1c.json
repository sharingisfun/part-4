Around 20 years later, some members of famed highwayman SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ndor RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³zsa's guerilla band, believed to be some of Kossuth's last supporters, are known to be interred among the prisoners in a camp. During the film, the prison staff try to weed out and identify the rebels and find out if SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ndor is among them using various means of mental and physical torture and trickery. When one of the guerillas, JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡nos Gajdar, is identified as a murderer by an old woman, he starts aiding his captors by acting as an informant. Gajdar is told that if he can show his captors a man who has killed more people than himself, he will be spared. Fearing for his life, he turns in several people his captors had been looking for by name, but couldn't identify among the prisoners.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Szegenylegenyek.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.21 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 26mn\n      Overall bit rate : 2 002 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 26mn\n      Bit rate : 1 737 Kbps\n      Width : 688 pixels\n      Height : 272 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 2.529\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.371\n      Stream size : 1.05 GiB (87%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 26mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 256 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 159 MiB (13%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059776/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059776/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHungarian audio; English and Portuguese subtitles\n\nMy rip\n\nMiklos Jancso - Szegenylegenyek [The Round-Up] (1966)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44bc5de0f4ae68fcd9c7ecfd42faf096c25ccd1c","amp;dn":"Miklos+Jancso+-+Szegenylegenyek+%5BThe+Round-Up%5D+%281966%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44bc5de0f4ae68fcd9c7ecfd42faf096c25ccd1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,188,93,224,244,174,104,252,217,199,236,253,66,250,240,150,194,92,205,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
