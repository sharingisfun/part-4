Produced by Terry Date, Repentless was written and recorded by guitarist Kerry King and singer/bassist Tom Araya at Henson Studios in Los Angeles, along with returning drummer Paul Bostaph and guitarist Gary Holt. Repentless is crushing and brutal, steadfastly refusing to cater to the mainstream.\n\nThirty-four years into its career, Slayer remains the preeminent punk-thrash band that helped establish the genre and that up-and-coming metal heads continue to revere and emulate. Slayer is a five-time nominated, two-time Grammy Award-winning metal juggernaut that writes songs which mirror the turmoil and aberrations of our society. Repentless, the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first new album in six years, continues the Slaytanic offensive with a twelve-song, blood-shaking sonic attack. Repentless is dark, fast, aggressive and without mercy. It was also the most challenging record Slayer has ever had to make.\n\nIn 2013 the world mourned the loss of guitarist Jeff Hanneman who died from complications following a two-year illness. A co-founder of Slayer, losing Jeff was very difficult for the band. During JeffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illness, friend of the band, guitarist Holt stepped in to help out on tour with JeffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blessing and stayed on. Around that time, drummer Dave Lombardo exited the band for the third time and Paul Bostaph, (who played with the band from 1992 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2001), returned to take over the throne. Slayer never skipped a beat and since Holt and Bostaph both played in Exodus, it was all-in-the-thrash-family.\n\nBut it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come easily. As guitarist and Slayer co-founder Kerry King puts it, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I remember the day that Jeff died. It was the day of the Revolver Golden Gods Awards. We knew heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been sick but nobody expected it to be so quick. I assumed IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be able to go out there and see him after I got done with whatever business I had to do and that day never came.\n[img]http://shop.nuclearblast.com/en/data/imagedata/shop-homepage/header-teaser/slayer_repentless_1294x716.jpg?x=1100[/img]\nYear: 2015\nStyle: Thrash Metal\nCountry: USA\nFormat:320k mp3\nSize: 97.00 MB\n\n\nAdded: 05/09/2015 07:43:15\nFiles: 13\n\n\nDescription: \n\nLength : 00:41:57\n\nTracks :\n\n\n01.
