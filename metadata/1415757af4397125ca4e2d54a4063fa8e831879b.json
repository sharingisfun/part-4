Some epic features (heightened prosaic style, songs to the hero) add to the standard typology of hero defeating villain. It has often been anthologized and has also been published more than once as a short book in its own right. The story was also adapted into an animated TV special by American animator Chuck Jones in 1975. That same year the story was adapted as a Russian animated short film.\n\n\n\tOrson Welles\t... \tNarrator / Nag / Chuchundra (voice)\n\tJune Foray\t... \tNagaina the Cobra, Wife of Nag / Teddy's Mother / Darzee's Wife (voice)\n\tLes Tremayne\t... \tFather (voice)\n\tMichael LeClair\t... \tTeddy (voice)\n\tShepard Menken\t... \tRikki-Tikki-Tavi the Mongoose (voice)\n\tLennie Weinrib\t... \tDarzee the Tailorbird (voice)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1415757af4397125ca4e2d54a4063fa8e831879b","amp;dn":"Chuck+Jones+Cartoons+%28Rikki-Tikki-Tavi%2C+Yankee+Doodle+Cricket%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1415757af4397125ca4e2d54a4063fa8e831879b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,21,117,122,244,57,113,37,202,78,45,84,164,6,63,168,232,49,135,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
