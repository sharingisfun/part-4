BrontÃƒÂ«Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s works were revolutionary for their time, reflecting a truthfulness about love and relationships that was not common in Victorian-era England. While Jane Eyre was, and continues to be, her most popular work, Charlotte BrontÃƒÂ« published numerous works during her short life, including juvenilia, poetry, and the novels Shirley and Villette. Charlotte BrontÃƒÂ« died in 1855, outliving both of her sisters, Anne and Emily. Collectively, the BrontÃƒÂ« sistersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ novels are considered literary standards that continue to influence modern writers.\n\nBibliographic information\nQR code for Jane Eyre\nTitle Jane Eyre\nAuthor Charlotte Bronte\nPublisher Harper Collins, 2013\nISBN 1443425052, 9781443425056\nLength 764 pages\n\n\n-------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n-------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e205f7065c0e99de69405513a06f0e704d6de8e","amp;dn":"Jane+Eyre%3A+An+Autobiography+by+Charlotte+Bronte+%5BHxH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e205f7065c0e99de69405513a06f0e704d6de8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,32,95,112,101,192,233,157,230,148,5,81,58,6,240,231,4,214,222,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
