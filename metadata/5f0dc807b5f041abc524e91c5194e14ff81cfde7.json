Among Thelonious Monk's long stays at New York's legendary Five Spot was a six-month period in 1957 with possibly his most brilliant band, with John Coltrane finding fuel in Monk's music for his harmonic explorations. \nThe quartet only recorded three studio tracks: a sublime reading of Monk's ballad &quot;Ruby, My Dear&quot;; a loping version of &quot;Nutty&quot;; and a stunning version of &quot;Trinkle Tinkle&quot; on which Trane's tenor mirrors Monk's piano part. The album is completed with outtakes of Ã¢â‚¬Å“EpistrophyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Off MinorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from an octet session that produced Ã¢â‚¬Å“MonkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s MusicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and joined John Coltrane and Coleman Hawkins, plus an extended solo version of &quot;Functional.&quot; \nEssential.\n\n\nThelonious Monk / John Coltrane\n\nThelonious Monk with John Coltrane\n\nRecorded in 1957-58, released in 1961\n\n\n\n  CD / 2000 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist: \n\n1.
