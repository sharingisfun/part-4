Scott Fitzgerald's The Last Tycoon, sometimes known as The Love of the Last Tycoon.\n\nDirected by Elia Kazan and produced by Sam Spiegel, the film starred Robert De Niro as &quot;Monroe Stahr,&quot; Tony Curtis as &quot;Rodriguez,&quot; Robert Mitchum as &quot;Pat Brady,&quot; Jack Nicholson as &quot;Brimmer,&quot; Donald Pleasence as &quot;Boxley&quot;, Jeanne Moreau as &quot;Didi&quot; and Theresa Russell as &quot;Cecilia Brady&quot;.\n\nThe film was the second collaboration between Kazan and Spiegel who worked closely together to make On the Waterfront. Spiegel was once awarded the Irving Thalberg Memorial Award and Fitzgerald based the novel's protagonist, Monroe Stahr, on producer Irving Thalberg. It was F. Scott Fitzgerald's last, unfinished novel as well as the last film Kazan directed.\n\nThe film did not receive the critical acclaim that much of Elia Kazan's earlier work received, but it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Art Direction (Gene Callahan, Jack T. Collis, Jerry Wunderlich).\n\n\nFile Name .............: The last tycoon 1976 Elia Kazan.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 1,467,777,024 bytes\nRuntime (# of frames) .: 02:03:08 (177134 frames)\nNTSC\nVideo Codec ...........: XviD\nFrame Size ............: 672x384 () [=] [=1.750]\nFPS ...................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate .........: 1552 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ........: 0.251 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC ......: [B-VOP]...[]...[]...[]\n\nAudio Codec ...........: 0x2000(AC3, Dolby Laboratories, Inc) AC3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate .........: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR audio\nInterleave ............: 96 ms\nNo. of audio streams ..: 1\n\nEnglish audio, english and portuguese subtitles\n\nNot my rip. \n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
