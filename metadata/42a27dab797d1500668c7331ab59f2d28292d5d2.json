I look for torrents but I couldn't find any ones that were just Java.\n\nOnce downloaded I compressed the installer exe using the best 7zip compression possible, and also did the same for a java for dummies ebook I torrented :P\n\nI know some people won't have 7zip so I also included it with this torrent, for ease of use.\n\nVirus free, 7zip and netbeans downloaded from the official site and no viruses reported. Java book was downloaded by me from a torrent, McAfee reports nothing bad after a scan and no problems with my computer since I got it.\n\nFor basic java tutorials without having to scroll through the large .pdf of the ebook, check out the offcial netbeans IDE tutorial at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/getStarted/cupojava/netbeans.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/getStarted/cupojava/netbeans.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis is also my first torrent, so please comment on how I can improve it, and please seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42a27dab797d1500668c7331ab59f2d28292d5d2","amp;dn":"Netbeans+IDE+%28Java+edition%29+%2B+Basic+Java+for+Dummies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42a27dab797d1500668c7331ab59f2d28292d5d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,162,125,171,121,125,21,0,102,140,115,49,171,89,242,210,130,146,213,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
