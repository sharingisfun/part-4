Ms. Hadzihalilovic based her screenplay on a relatively obscure text by the German-born playwright Frank Wedekind called &quot;Mine-Haha, or the Corporeal Education of Young Girls.&quot; The fealty of Ms. Hadzihalilovic's translation of the Wedekind text notwithstanding, the dubious vision of utopia put forth in this film finds the girls engaged in an almost militaristic pursuit of physical perfection without commensurate attention paid to their intellect.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img75.imageshack.us/img75/1614/95707877eu7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img75.imageshack.us/img75/1614/95707877eu7.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img259.imageshack.us/img259/2535/47909184ul3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img259.imageshack.us/img259/2535/47909184ul3.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img393.imageshack.us/img393/9596/67993396mx2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img393.imageshack.us/img393/9596/67993396mx2.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img393.imageshack.us/img393/8528/38390365hc8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img393.imageshack.us/img393/8528/38390365hc8.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img393.imageshack.us/img393/1476/20214080be0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img393.imageshack.us/img393/1476/20214080be0.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n------------not my rip--------------\n\nFilesize.....: 1,600 MB (or 1,638,524 KB or 1,677,848,576 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:54:56 (172,401 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1494 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: ac3 (0x2000) Dolby Laboratories, Inc\nAudio Bitrate: 448 kb/s (6 ch) CBR\nFrame Size...: 672x288 (2.33:1) [=7:3] \n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
