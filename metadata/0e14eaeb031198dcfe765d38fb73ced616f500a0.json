He was the recipient of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat.&quot;\n\nVargas Llosa is one of Latin America's most significant novelists and essayists, and one of the leading writers of his generation.  Some critics consider him to have had a larger international impact and worldwide audience than any other writer of the Latin American boom.  Gerald Martin, writing in 1987, asserted that Vargas Llosa was &quot;perhaps the most successful [and] certainly the most controversial Latin American novelist of the past twenty-five years.&quot;\n\nHe rose to fame in the 1960s with novels such as THE TIME OF THE HERO (1963) and the monumental CONVERSATION IN THE CATHEDRAL (1969).  He writes prolifically across an array of literary genres, including literary criticism and journalism.  His novels include comedies, murder mysteries, historical novels, and political thrillers.  Several, such as CAPTAIN PANTOJA AND THE SPECIAL SERVICE (1973) and AUNT JULIA AND THE SCRIPTWRITER (1977), have been adapted as feature films.\n\nMany of Vargas Llosa's works are influenced by the writer's perception of Peruvian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian.  Increasingly, however, he has expanded his range, and tackled themes that arise from other parts of the world.  In his essays, Vargas Llosa has made many criticisms of nationalism in different parts of the world.  Another change over the course of his career has been a shift from a style and approach associated with literary modernism to a sometimes playful postmodernism.\n\nThis collections features a large selection of his novels and short fiction, essays, and journalism, including a memoir, three plays, and his Nobel Prize acceptance speech.\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB/MOBI format unless otherwise indicated:\n\n\n                             == Novels &amp; Short Fiction ==\n\n* AUNT JULIA AND THE SCRIPTWRITER (FSG, 1982).
