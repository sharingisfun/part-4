Gary Jules (iTunes)\n\nNotes:  This took awhile for me to work on.  I took a listen to a few of the uploads on here and the iTunes version on iTunes and then the CD for the soundtrack it is originally from to get a idea if all the versions sound like they are low quality and all I have to say is they are ALL low quality.  So I cleaned up the song a bit without ruining the feeling you get from the songs eerie sound. I also cut down the bass a bit so when the violin comes in you can actually hear the lyrics and enjoy it.\n\nIf you havn't done so, play Gears of War 3.  When this song came on all I could think is what a perfect moment to play it.  \n\nAnyways enjoy.  And if you havn't figured it out yet, this is the &quot;Gears of War&quot; song.  I'm sure thats the only reason you have heard of it.\n\nEncoding:\n*********\nM4A AAC Format\n256Kbps (LOSSLESS M4A)\n44100Hz\nChannels: Stereo\nSource: CD\n\nIf you don't like my release then take a listen to other versions before complaining about it.\n\nSeed, Comment, and most of all enjoy.\n\nPS: As a notice, my next upload (which will most likely be today) is going to be Tyler the Creator - Goblin.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea2e5ef4433a0563bcf20de58f3d942106a794be","amp;dn":"Mad+World+-+Michael+Andrews+Feat.+Gary+Jules+%28iTunes%29+%2ATyMoD%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea2e5ef4433a0563bcf20de58f3d942106a794be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,46,94,244,67,58,5,99,188,242,13,229,143,61,148,33,6,167,148,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
