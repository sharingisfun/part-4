Records and Asylum Records. The name of the album comes from the Italian political theorist Machiavelli, inspired by Tupac Shakur, whose final stage name and pseudonym before his death was Makaveli. (wikipedia)\n\n- - - \n\nEach track gives a new perspective on the same basic archetype, reducing gangsta rap to its building blocks: hypermasculine children of the drug trade, reckless fatalism, intensity, and physicality. Waka's aggression is the survivalist reaction of the powerless, directed toward the threats of the immediate environment. He knows his strengths and he plays to them, exactingly.\n(David Drake)\n\n- - -\n\nWaka Flocka Flame - Flockaveli  2010\n(Asylum/Warner)\n\n 1. Bustin' At 'Em \n 2. Hard In Da Paint\n 3.
