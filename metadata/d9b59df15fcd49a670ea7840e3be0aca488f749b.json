Nazi Germany. The country is holding its breath. Death has never been busier, and will become busier still.\n\nLiesel Meminger is a foster girl living outside of Munich, who scratches out a meager existence for herself by stealing when she encounters something she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t resistÃ¢â‚¬â€œbooks. With the help of her accordion-playing foster father, she learns to read and shares her stolen books with her neighbors during bombing raids as well as with the Jewish man hidden in her basement.\n\nIn superbly crafted writing that burns with intensity, award-winning author Markus Zusak, author of I Am the Messenger, has given us one of the most enduring stories of our time.\n\nPublishers Weekly\nCorduner uses considerable zeal and a talent for accents to navigate Zusak's compelling, challenging novel set in Nazi Germany. Death serves as knowing narrator for the tale, which is framed much like a lengthy flashback. The storytelling aspects of this structure include asides to the listener, and lots of foreshadowing about what eventually happens to the various lead characters-appealing features for listeners. But Corduner seems to most enjoy embracing the heart of things here-the rather small and ordinary saga of 10-year-old Liesel Meminger, who has been given over to a foster family following her mother's branding as a &quot;Kommunist&quot; and the death of her younger brother. Under her foster parents' care, she learns how to read, how to keep terrifying secrets and how to hone her skills as a book thief, a practice that keeps her sane and feeds her newfound love of words. With quick vocal strokes, Corduner paints vivid, provocative portraits of Germans and Jews under unfathomable duress and the ripple effect such circumstances have on their lives.\n\nFrom the Publisher\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Brilliant and hugely ambitiousÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Some will argue that a book so difficult and sad may not be appropriate for teenage readersÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Adults will probably like it (this one did), but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a great young-adult novelÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the kind of book that can be life-changing, because without ever denying the essential amorality and randomness of the natural order, The Book Thief offers us a believable hard-won hopeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦The hope we see in Liesel is unassailable, the kind you can hang on to in the midst of poverty and war and violence. Young readers need such alternatives to ideological rigidity, and such explorations of how stories matter. And so, come to think of it, do adults.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ -New York Times, May 14, 2006\n&quot;The Book Thief is unsettling and unsentimental, yet ultimately poetic. Its grimness and tragedy run through the reader's mind like a black-and-white movie, bereft of the colors of life. Zusak may not have lived under Nazi domination, but The Book Thief deserves a place on the same shelf with The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank and Elie Wiesel's Night. It seems poised to become a classic.&quot; \n- USA Today\n&quot;Zusak doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sugarcoat anything, but he makes his ostensibly gloomy subject bearable the same way Kurt Vonnegut did in Slaughterhouse-Five: with grim, darkly consoling humor.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n- Time Magazine\n&quot;Elegant, philosophical and moving...Beautiful and important.&quot;\n- Kirkus Reviews, Starred\n&quot;This hefty volume is an achievement...a challenging book in both length and subject...&quot;\n- Publisher's Weekly, Starred \n&quot;One of the most highly anticipated young-adult books in years.&quot;\n- The Wall Street Journal\n&quot;Exquisitely written and memorably populated, Zusak's poignant tribute to words, survival, and their curiously inevitable entwinement is a tour de force to be not just read but inhabited.&quot;\n- The Horn Book Magazine, Starred\n&quot;An extraordinary narrative.&quot;\n- School Library Journal, Starred\n&quot;The Book Thief will be appreciated for Mr. Zusak's audacity, also on display in his earlier I Am the Messenger. It will be widely read and admired because it tells a story in which books become treasures. And because there's no arguing with a sentiment like that.&quot; \n- New York Times","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9b59df15fcd49a670ea7840e3be0aca488f749b","amp;dn":"Markus+Zusak+-+The+Book+Thief+%5Bunabridged%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9b59df15fcd49a670ea7840e3be0aca488f749b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,181,157,241,95,205,73,166,112,234,120,64,227,190,10,202,72,143,116,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
