Van Dyke\n\nThe Thin Man is a 1934 American comic detective film starring William Powell and Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles, a flirtatious married couple who banter wittily as they solve crimes with ease. Nick is a hard drinking retired detective and Nora a wealthy heiress. Their dog, the Wire-Haired Fox Terrier Asta, played by Skippy, was also a popular character.\n\nCompleted in 1934 and nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, the film was directed by W.S. Van Dyke from a script by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich; the screenplay was based on the mystery novel The Thin Man by Dashiell Hammett, supposedly based on his relationship with playwright Lillian Hellman. Also appearing in the film were Maureen O'Sullivan, Nat Pendleton, Minna Gombell, Cesar Romero and Porter Hall.\n\nThe &quot;Thin Man&quot; of the title was actually not Nick Charles, but the man he was initially hired to find, Clyde Wynant. (Partway through the film, Nick Charles characterizes Wynant as a &quot;thin man with white hair&quot;.) However, the &quot;Thin Man&quot; moniker was thought by many viewers to refer to Nick Charles, and after a time, it was used in the titles of the sequels as if it did. Nevertheless, at no time in this or any other &quot;Thin Man&quot; film is Nick Charles called or characterized as a thin man.\n\nIn 1997, the film was added to the United States National Film Registry having been deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;\n\nMedia Info:\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : J:\\Seeding\\The Thin Man (1934)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢]\\The Thin Man (1934)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢].AVI\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 1.16 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 30mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 830 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 30mn\nBit rate                         : 1 497 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4:3\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nStandard                         : NTSC\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.181\nStream size                      : 973 MiB (82%)\nWriting library                  : XviD \n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 30mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 208 MiB (17%)\nAlignment                        : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 24 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98\n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.50.1.1100\nwww.malwarebytes.org\n\nDatabase version: 5891\n2/27/2011 2:48:12 AM\nmbam-log-2011-02-27 (02-48-12).txt\n\nScan type: Quick scan\nObjects scanned: 5\nTime elapsed: 47 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nWhen using TPB please read these important notes:\n  \n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n\nRequests?
