Seligman draws on more than twenty years of clinical research to demonstrate how optimism enchances the quality of life, and how anyone can learn to practice it. Offering many simple techniques, Dr. Seligman explains how to break an Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â€give-upÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ habit, develop a more constructive explanatory style for interpreting your behavior, and experience the benefits of a more positive interior dialogue. These skills can help break up depression, boost your immune system, better develop your potential, and make you happier.. With generous additional advice on how to encourage optimistic behavior at school, at work and in children, Learned Optimism is both profound and practicalÃ¢â‚¬â€œand valuable for every phase of life.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e380bce55b2ba0fbbec42714fb7dc0f4e5ea8db9","amp;dn":"Learned+Optimism+by+Martin+E.+Seligman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e380bce55b2ba0fbbec42714fb7dc0f4e5ea8db9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,128,188,229,91,43,160,251,190,196,39,20,251,125,192,244,229,234,141,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
