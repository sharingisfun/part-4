Creators of an enviable string of hits from 1966 through 1969, they got caught in a shift in popular culture and the unwritten criteria for significance in that field and never recovered. The group's smooth harmonies and pop-oriented sound (which occasionally moved into psychedelia and, much more rarely, into a harder, almost garage-punk vein) made them regular occupants of the highest reaches of the pop charts for two years -- their biggest hits, including &quot;Along Comes Mary,&quot; &quot;Cherish,&quot; &quot;Windy,&quot; and &quot;Never My Love,&quot; became instant staples of AM play lists, which was a respectable achievement for most musicians at the time. That same sound, along with their AM radio popularity, however, proved a liability as the music environment around them changed at the end of the decade. Additionally, their ensemble singing, essential to the group's sound and appeal, all but ensured that the individual members never emerged as personalities in their own right. The Association was as anonymous an outfit as their contemporaries the Grass Roots, in terms of any individual names or attributes, despite the fact that both groups generated immensely popular hits that millions of listeners embraced on a deeply personal level. \n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.The Time It Is Today\n02.Everything That Touches You\n03.Like Always\n04.Never My Love\n05.Requiem For The Masses\n06.Along Comes Mary\n07.Enter The Young\n08.No Fair At All\n09.Time For Livin'\n10.We Love Us\n11.Cherish\n12.Windy\n13.Six Man Band\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd08aa755e5499c803facfc49e964d5e2d455ecd","amp;dn":"The+Association+-+Greatest+Hits+%281987%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd08aa755e5499c803facfc49e964d5e2d455ecd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,8,170,117,94,84,153,200,3,250,207,196,158,150,77,94,45,69,94,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
