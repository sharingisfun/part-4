Chrono Trigger features a colorful cast of characters, an interesting story with multiple endings, open ended free form time travel, non-random battles and a lot of fun mini-games. This game is truly one of a kind, there's just no other game like it. \n\nUnfortunately Square-Enix issued a cease and desist order to the Chrono Trigger Resurrection Project, which was well on it's way producing a graphically superior version of the game full of original content, artwork, and cinematic. No job well done, no apology, no job offer, no concern for the fans, no compassion, no compensation for the years or grueling work put into the project. Suck it Square-Enix, you've fallen from your glory days. You used to care about your fans, now all you care about are your bank accounts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0616d2d4e98987dd0a3d0205b23987c3340f73e5","amp;dn":"%28PSX%29+Chrono+Trigger+%28USA-NTSC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0616d2d4e98987dd0a3d0205b23987c3340f73e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,22,210,212,233,137,135,221,10,61,2,5,178,57,135,195,52,15,115,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
