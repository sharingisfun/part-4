However, it seems she just can't stay dead, and Miller himself (despite a complicated relationship with the character) as well as others have resurrected her from time to time. She has proven quite popular over the years and has had an ongoing series twice as well as her own feature film, subsequent to her appearance in the Daredevil movie. This torrent collects the first major arc of her character and nearly all of her appearances in one-shots, minis, and TPBs over the years. Her later appearances in Daredevil, Thunderbolts and other regular titles such as Wolverine are not featured. Included are the following:\n\n*NOTE - for TPB users, I have posted this collection before, but this is updated with several better versions of the various releases and extra material not in the original, hence the REMIX tag. I also removed the reprint series after deeming them superfluous. I will note all the changes and scanners below where appropriate.\n\n-Frank Miller Classics, which contains Daredevil Visionaries - Frank Miller, Volume 2 + Volume 3 (1981-1983) - The first appearance of Elektra and her first major storylines as well.
