The 1976 compilation captured the darkest and beefiest moments from the Ozzy years and served as a right of passage for millions of aspiring musicians, burnouts, pastor's kids, and closet miscreants. Rhino's 16-track Greatest Hits 1970-1978 anthology only trumps the single-disc We Sold Our Soul CD by two songs, but it offers superior sound and features at least a few cuts from 1976's Technical Ecstasy and 1978's Never Say Die!, the band's last two pre-millennium Ozzy records. All of the faves are here (&quot;Paranoid,&quot; &quot;War Pigs,&quot; &quot;Iron Man&quot;), as well as fan classics like &quot;Hole in the Sky&quot; and &quot;Supernaut,&quot; but there is enough material missing to call it a sampler rather than a &quot;best of.&quot; Fans who are unwilling to shell out the extra money for Sanctuary's superior two-disc Sabbath collection from 2005 will find this sparse yet solid overview to be a useful &quot;CliffsNotes&quot; rendering of the birth of heavy metal.\nAll Music Review by James Christopher Monger\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Black Sabbath\n[02] N.I.B.\n[03] The Wizard\n[04] War Pigs\n[05] Paranoid\n[06] Iron Man\n[07] Sweet Leaf\n[08] Children Of The Grave\n[09] Changes\n[10] Snowblind\n[11] Supernaut\n[12] Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\n[13] Hole In The Sky\n[14] Rock 'N' Roll Doctor\n[15] Never Say Die\n[16] Dirty Women\n\nCD Play Time - 01h:19m:30s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 567mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
