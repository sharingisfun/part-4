A year ago, Nesuhi ErtegÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼n suggested that I record an entire blues album in the style of Haitian Fight Song (in Atlantic LP 1260), because some people, particularly critics, were saying I didn't swing enough. He wanted to give them a barrage of soul music: churchy, blues, swinging, earthy. I thought it over. I was born swinging and clapped my hands in church as a little boy, but I've grown up and I like to do things other than just swing. But blues can do more than just swing. So I agreed.\n\nIn response to critical carping that his ambitious, evocative music somehow didn't swing enough, Charles Mingus returned to the earthiest and earliest sources of black musical expression, namely the blues, gospel, and old-time New Orleans jazz. The resulting LP, Blues and Roots, isn't quite as wildly eclectic as usual, but it ranks as arguably Mingus' most joyously swinging outing. Working with simple forms, Mingus boosts the complexity of the music by assembling a nine-piece outfit and arranging multiple lines to be played simultaneously ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ somewhat akin to the Dixieland ensembles of old, but with an acutely modern flavor. Anyone who had heard &quot;Haitian Fight Song&quot; shouldn't have been surprised that such an album was well within Mingus' range, but jazz's self-appointed guardians have long greeted innovation with reactionary distaste. After Blues and Roots, there could be no question of Mingus' firm grounding in the basics, nor of his deeply felt affinity with them. Whether the music is explicitly gospel-based ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ like the groundbreaking classic &quot;Wednesday Night Prayer Meeting&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or not, the whole album is performed with a churchy fervor that rips through both the exuberant swingers and the aching, mournful slow blues. Still, it's the blues that most prominently inform the feeling of the album, aside from the aforementioned &quot;Wednesday Night Prayer Meeting&quot; and the Jelly Roll Morton tribute &quot;My Jelly Roll Soul.&quot; The recording session was reportedly very disorganized, but perhaps that actually helped give the performances the proper feel, since they wound up so loose and free-swinging. With a lineup including John Handy and Jackie McLean on alto, Booker Ervin on tenor, frequent anchor Pepper Adams on baritone, and Jimmy Knepper and Willie Dennis on trombones, among others, Blues and Roots isn't hurting for fiery soloists, and they help make the album perhaps the most soulful in Mingus' discography.\n\nTracklist\n\n1.&quot;Wednesday Night Prayer Meeting&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:39\n2.&quot;Cryin' Blues&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:58\n3.&quot;Moanin'&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:01\n4.&quot;Tensions&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:27\n5.&quot;My Jelly Roll Soul&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:47\n6.&quot;E's Flat Ah's Flat Too&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:37\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n[color=lime]Charles Mingus ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\nJohn Handy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ alto sax\nJackie McLean ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ alto sax\nBooker Ervin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ tenor sax\nPepper Adams ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ baritone sax\nJimmy Knepper ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ trombone\nWillie Dennis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ trombone\nDannie Richmond ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums\nHorace Parlan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ piano, except for &quot;E's Flat Ah's Flat Too&quot;\nMal Waldron ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ piano on &quot;E's Flat Ah's Flat Too&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ac6734ab11c1226ba96758effd1e030a001966f","amp;dn":"Charles+Mingus+Blues+and+Roots%28jazz%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogerc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ac6734ab11c1226ba96758effd1e030a001966f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,198,115,74,177,28,18,38,186,150,117,142,255,209,224,48,160,1,150,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
