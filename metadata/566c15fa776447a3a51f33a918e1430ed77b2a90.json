In 1973, he shared a\nGrammy Award win in the Best Chamber Music Performance category with Julian\nBream for Julian and John (Works by Lawes, Carulli, AlbÃƒÂ©niz, Granados).\nWilliams recorded &quot;Cavatina&quot; by Stanley Myers. The piece originally included\nonly the first few measures but, at Williams' request, it was rewritten for\nguitar and expanded by Myers. After this transformation it was used for a film,\nThe Walking Stick (1970). In 1973, Cleo Laine wrote lyrics and recorded it as\nthe song &quot;He Was Beautiful&quot; accompanied by Williams. The guitar version became\na worldwide hit single when it was used as the theme tune to the Oscar-winning\nfilm The Deer Hunter (1978). &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams_(guitarist)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams_(guitarist)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWith art work.\n\n\nJohn Williams - Portrait Of John Williams\n1982\n\n01  John Williams - Portrait Of ... - Seis Por Derecho (A.
