Marianne Cusato, creator of the award-winning Katrina Cottages, is a champion of traditional architectural principles: structural common sense, aesthetics of form, appropriateness to a neighborhood, and sustainability. She presents the definitive guide to what makes houses look and feel right, revealing the dos and don'ts of livable home design. Hundreds of elegant line drawings--rendering the varieties of architectural features and displaying Ã¢â‚¬Å“avoidÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“useÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ versions of the same elements side by side--make this an indispensable resource for designing and building a timelessly beautiful home.\n\n\nBy Marianne Cusato, Ben Pentreath, Richard Sammons, Leon Krier\nPublished by Sterling Publishing in 2011\nEPUB, Retail, 272 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b576cecfd7bab7c3c2fc6b86f43236565fd731d","amp;dn":"Get+Your+House+Right+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b576cecfd7bab7c3c2fc6b86f43236565fd731d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,87,108,236,253,123,171,124,60,47,198,184,111,67,35,101,101,253,115,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
