It is the projectÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s third and was announced as their last studio album, though the duo has since decided to make a fourth. Like the previous two albums, it features many live musicians and vocalists in combination with computer-generated sounds and spoken-word samples. Stylistically the album can be described as a fusion of world music, intelligent dance music, and psychedelic trance. It is dedicated to the memory of author and psychedelic researcher Terence McKenna, whose voice and ideas are used throughout the album. The tracks flow together continuously without any break.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36a41cce3dfb7039c1c9cfd10281e15a07decbf4","amp;dn":"Shpongle+-+Nothing+Lasts...+But+Nothing+Is+Lost+%282005%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36a41cce3dfb7039c1c9cfd10281e15a07decbf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,164,28,206,61,251,112,57,193,201,207,209,2,129,225,90,7,222,203,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
