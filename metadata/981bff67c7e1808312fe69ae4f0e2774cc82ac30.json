He subsequently worked as a bike messenger, porn magazine art director, and production assistant for the classic children's TV series Pee-Wee's Playhouse, concurrently leading White Zombie through a series of cult-favorite indie releases; the success of their 1992 major-label debut, La Sexorcisto: Devil Music Vol. 1, not only launched Zombie to new prominence within the music industry, but also allowed him to try his hand at animation (most notably a hallucinatory sequence of the feature Beavis &amp; Butt-Head Do America) and directing (he was slated to helm the third chapter of The Crow franchise, working from his own screenplay, but Miramax Films eventually pulled out of the deal).\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tMetal\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Thunder Kiss '65\n02.Black Sunshine\n03.More Human Than Human\n04.Super-Charger Heaven\n05.Dragula\n06.Superbeast\n07.Living Dead Girl\n08.Never Gonna Stop (The Red Red Kroovy)\n09.House Of 1000 Corpses\n10.Feel So Numb\n11.The Devil's Rejects\n12.The Lords Of Salem\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:981bff67c7e1808312fe69ae4f0e2774cc82ac30","amp;dn":"Rob+Zombie+-+20th+Century+Masters+Best+Of+%282006%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"981bff67c7e1808312fe69ae4f0e2774cc82ac30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,27,255,103,199,225,128,131,18,254,105,174,79,14,39,116,204,130,172,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
