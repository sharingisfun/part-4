Vehicle ECUs vary in the amount of sensors supported\n\n*PLEASE NOTE* Any reports of hanging or reboots after quitting the app is due to a bug in HTC devices and Galaxy Tab,this can be triggered by using the Pandora/Vlingo/Other BT apps. Disabling Pandoras new bluetooth settings fixes the problem, but HTC/Samsung need to release a fix.Please contact their support and request a fix,Thanks!\n\nChangelog: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torque-bhp.com/forums/?wpforumaction=viewtopic&amp;t=3.0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torque-bhp.com/forums/?wpforumaction=viewtopic&amp;t=3.0&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8588991934cbdad1f9d3cd8fe87c349839a53917","amp;dn":"Torque+Pro+%28OBD+2+%26amp%3B+Car%29+v1.8.32+%5BPaid%5D+APK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8588991934cbdad1f9d3cd8fe87c349839a53917","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,136,153,25,52,203,218,209,249,211,205,143,232,124,52,152,57,165,57,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
