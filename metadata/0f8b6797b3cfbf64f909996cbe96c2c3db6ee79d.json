The text provides a gradual development of control theory, shows how to solve all computational problems with MATLAB, and avoids highly mathematical arguments. A wealth of examples and worked problems are featured throughout the text.\nLaplace transform; mathematical modeling of mechanical systems, electrical systems, fluid systems, and thermal systems; transient and steady-state-response analyses, root-locus analysis and control systems design by the root-locus method; frequency-response analysis and control systems design by the frequency-response; two-degrees-of-freedom control; state space analysis of control systems and design of control systems in state space. he new edition includes improved coverage of Root-Locus Analysis (Chapter 6) and Frequency-Response Analysis (Chapter 8). The author has also updated and revised many of the worked examples and end-of-chapter problems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f8b6797b3cfbf64f909996cbe96c2c3db6ee79d","amp;dn":"Modern+Control+Engineering+5th+ed+-+Katsuhiko+Ogata","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f8b6797b3cfbf64f909996cbe96c2c3db6ee79d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,139,103,151,179,207,191,100,249,9,153,108,190,150,194,195,219,110,231,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
