The fact is your chances are 14 million to one. If you entered the lottery once every week, thenÃ¢â‚¬â€sureÃ¢â‚¬â€you can expect to win.\n\nAbout once in every two hundred and seventy thousand years! But still there are those who believe that if they sit and listen as number after number is called out on the TV, that this will be their week. Their lucky break.\n\nThen there are those that know that they must do more than watch spinning balls to make their lives a success; that in order to do more, to have more, to become master of their own destinyÃ¢â‚¬â€they must change. They must act. And this book is for them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ae54fc28039bb76f9f8665a2ce6cd9293ac1f80","amp;dn":"What+Self-Made+Millionaires+Really+Think%2C+Know+and+Do","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ae54fc28039bb76f9f8665a2ce6cd9293ac1f80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,229,79,194,128,57,187,118,249,248,102,90,44,230,205,146,147,172,31,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
