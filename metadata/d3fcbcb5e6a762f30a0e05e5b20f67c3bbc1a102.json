Now, in her first-ever book on home improvement, she offers a compulsively readable, zanily humorous, yet also completely practical guide to a headache-free home makeover for everyone decorating a new house or updating an old one.\r\nJameson has designed, built, and decorated three homes from the ground up. In The House Always Wins, she brings us along as she decorates, furnishes, and landscapes her current home. Though rooted in her own experience, this is no navel-gazing memoir. Rather, Jameson is like a favorite sister who has learned it all the hard way and is now here to prompt and inspire you to figure out your own personal style, make a design plan, and create your (almost) perfect dream home--one step at a time.\r\n\r\nWith Jameson as our guide, we navigate through the seemingly endless maze of choices and decisions every home improver faces: wall color, flooring, cabinetry, window treatments, furniture, bargain hunting, home accessories, rugs, kids' spaces, special purpose rooms (like the garage and guest, laundry, and mud rooms), landscaping, outdoor living spaces--and that's just to start.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, Jameson injects insights into the relationships and realities that dog every home improvement project. She also pauses to share hard-won secrets and money-saving tips distilled from her own redecorating experience and from interviews with dozens of renowned home-design experts.\r\n\r\nFor anyone dealing with budgets, time constraints, unreliable contractors, a cheap spouse, kids, and pets--and who would appreciate having someone to commiserate with about the unattainable perfection featured in glossy magazine spreads--The House Always Wins will comfort (it can always be worse), inspire (who knew?!), and be absolutely indispensable","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3fcbcb5e6a762f30a0e05e5b20f67c3bbc1a102","amp;dn":"The+House+Always+Wins%3A+Create+the+Home+You+Love+%28PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3fcbcb5e6a762f30a0e05e5b20f67c3bbc1a102","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,252,188,181,230,167,98,243,10,14,5,229,178,15,103,195,187,193,161,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
