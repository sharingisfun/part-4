Ã¢â‚¬Å“In A Silent WayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is neither jazz nor rock. It isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t what will eventually become known as fusion, either. It is something altogether different, something universal. \n\n\nMiles Davis\n\nThe Complete In a Silent Way Sessions\n\n(September 1968 - February 1969)\n\n\n  3 CDs / 2004 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nCD 1: \n\n1.
