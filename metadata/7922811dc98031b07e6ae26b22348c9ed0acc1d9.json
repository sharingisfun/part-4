Examining not only the very nature of risks and consequences, with fascinating historical examples, the book progresses from simple to more complex risk assessment techniques used by the authors in their daily work, all presented in a form that can be readily adapted to any number of real-life situations:\n\nEcological Risk Assessment\n\nTask Analysis Techniques\n\nPreliminary Hazards Analysis\n\nFailure Mode and Effects Analysis\n\nHuman Reliability Analysis\n\nCritical Incident Technique\n\nWith numerous industry-specific case studies, as well as additional case studies for risk assessments for a restaurant and a process plant, the book provides readers with complete examples of how each of the techniques can be used in a variety of real-world situations.
