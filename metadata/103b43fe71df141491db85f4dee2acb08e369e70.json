But, along with Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd &amp; Tenacious D, Ween has earned that right.\n\nWeen is the best band E-V-E-R**period**\n\nYou have to blindly commit yourself to this fact before you listen to them, or else you might misinterpret their genius and think me a liar. Then Boognish will come for you in the night. Don't say I didn't warn you.\n\nBut, if you're able to peel back those layers of psychedelic insanity and madness, make a left at the Wendy's and stare Boognish right in those big pearly whites you may find yourself, like so many others, consumed by the brilliance that is Dean &amp; Gene Ween.\n\nan'way...\n\nThis is Ween's latest release, Shinola (Volume 1). It's the first in a series of albums featuring songs that never made it onto their other albums.\n\nTis encoded @ 192kbps VBR MP3.\n\n01. Tastes Good On Th' Bun\n02. Boys Club\n03.
