My Morning Jacket&amp;#039;s third full-length effort, and first for the ATO/RCA venture label, is a step beyond the band&amp;#039;s work for Darla. While the gorgeous amalgam of the Band&amp;#039;s vision of country/Americana and Neil Young&amp;#039;s blend of folk and rock are everywhere present, there is a new textural awareness evident on It Still Moves. Jim James&amp;#039; songwriting is tighter in structure, but his production sensibility is early-&amp;#039;70s Laurel Canyon, with some of the Grateful Dead&amp;#039;s American Beauty tropes as well. Sounds like a mess, doesn&amp;#039;t it? Well, it&amp;#039;s not. Wearing your influences on your sleeve doesn&amp;#039;t mean unoriginality. James is an original songwriter; he has worked hard to develop the gifts inherent in his lyric concerns and his ability to paint emotional landscapes with his melodies, and the payoff has never been greater. &quot;Mahgeetah,&quot; with its Pet Sounds ambience and country-rock melody complete with fuzzed-out guitar solo is far more imaginative than anything Wilco ever pulled off by trying the same thing (which they do over and over ad nauseam). &quot;Dancefloors,&quot; with its biting Telecaster lead line that echoes &quot;Baby Don&amp;#039;t Do It&quot; and the Stray Gators&amp;#039; country majesty, is full of warmth, depth, and Levon Helm&amp;#039;s soul. And &quot;Golden,&quot; which is the third track in this opening triad, brings James&amp;#039; love of Tim Buckley and Fred Neil into the light. But all of these elements of construction are read through James&amp;#039; Kentucky and his unique melodic gift, where fragments becomes entire lines become songs with stunning bridges, achingly poetic lyrics, and a country boy&amp;#039;s sense of whacked-out humor and tenderness (check out &quot;One Big Holiday&quot;). The horn arrangements on &quot;Easy Morning Rebel&quot; make the country shuffle into a near R&amp;B tune with an old-timey stroll through a shambolic rhythm track. In all, My Morning Jacket may be a journey through the past, but it&amp;#039;s also a solid step into something rock &amp; roll has been missing for an awfully long time in the mainstream arena: melody, extremely catchy and well-written songs that aren&amp;#039;t afraid of the mainstream, and a love of the great pop continuum that translates into something new. \n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34cda5fe58c98e207b46975fab097d2d86874f1a","amp;dn":"My+Morning+Jacket+-+It+Still+Moves","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34cda5fe58c98e207b46975fab097d2d86874f1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,205,165,254,88,201,142,32,123,70,151,95,171,9,125,45,134,135,79,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
