The new seventh edition represents a major restructuring and update of previous editions, solidifying the book's position as the most comprehensive guide to this important subject.\n\nThe seventh edition of Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach has been designed to consolidate and restructure the content introduced over the past two editions of the book. The chapter structure will return to a more linear presentation of software engineering topics with a direct emphasis on the major activities that are part of a generic software process.\n\nContent will focus on widely used software engineering methods and will de-emphasize or completely eliminate discussion of secondary methods, tools and techniques. The intent is to provide a more targeted, prescriptive, and focused approach, while attempting to maintain SEPA's reputation as a comprehensive guide to software engineering.\n\nThe book will be organized in five (5) parts-Process, Modeling, Quality Management, Project Management, and Advanced Topics. The chapter count will remain at 32, unchanged from the sixth edition. However, eight new chapters have been developed and another six chapters have undergone major or moderate revisions. The remaining chapters have undergone minor edits/updates.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the Author:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRoger S. Pressman is an internationally recognised authority on software process improvement and software engineering technologies. He is currently president of R. S. Pressman and Associates Inc., a consultancy specialising in software engineering practices.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo Password or Surveys.
