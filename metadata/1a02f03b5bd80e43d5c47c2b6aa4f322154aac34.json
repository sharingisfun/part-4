Three years before the Whitechapel killings, London is a city of fog and darkness. A severed head is dredged from the Thames; ten miles away, a womanâ€™s body is discovered on Edgeware Road. The famed American detective William Pinkerton is summoned by Scotland Yard to investigate. The dead woman fits the description of a grifter Pinkerton had been pursuing for a long timeâ€“someone he believed would lead him to a man he has been hunting since his fatherâ€™s death.\r\nEdward Shade is an industrialist without a past, a fabled con, a thief of other menâ€™s futuresâ€“he seems a ghost, a man of smoke. The obsessive hunt for him that began in the last days of the Civil War becomes Pinkertonâ€™s inheritance. What follows is an epic journey of secrets, deceit, and betrayals. Above all, it is the story of the most unlikely of bonds: between Pinkerton, the greatest detective of his age, and Shade, the one criminal he cannot outwit.\r\nSteven Priceâ€™s By Gaslight is a riveting, atmospheric portrait of a man on the brink. Moving from the diamond mines of South Africa to the fog-enshrouded streets of Victorian London, the novel is a journey into a cityscape of grief, trust, and its breaking, where what we share can bind us even against our better selves.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a02f03b5bd80e43d5c47c2b6aa4f322154aac34","amp;dn":"By+Gaslight+-+Steven+Price+%5BEN+EPUB%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a02f03b5bd80e43d5c47c2b6aa4f322154aac34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,2,240,59,91,216,14,67,213,196,124,43,106,164,243,34,21,74,172,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
