And, because so much learning takes place outside of the classroom, this series provides learning tools that students can access anywhere, any time.\nStudents go to college now with a different set of skills than they did years ago. With this in mind, the Exploring series seeks to move students beyond the basics of the software at a faster pace, without sacrificing coverage of the fundamental skills that everyone needs to know.\n\n-------------\nKeep Learning and help us to share the Knowledge acroos the World.\n-------------\nMore Ebooks: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/GOLU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/GOLU&lt;/a&gt;\ntweet us @teamGOLU","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42c2858f57a578a0feea9ba7c0ae0e8a5af365f0","amp;dn":"Exploring+Microsoft+Excel+2013%2C+Comprehensive+-+Prentice+Hall+%282","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42c2858f57a578a0feea9ba7c0ae0e8a5af365f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,194,133,143,87,165,120,160,254,234,155,167,192,174,14,138,90,243,101,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
