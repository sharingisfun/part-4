It was founded by Pierre Lazareff and his wife HÃ©lÃ¨ne Gordon[4] in 1945. The title, in French, means &quot;she&quot; or &quot;her&quot;.\r\n\r\nElle was founded in France in 1945. In the 1960s, it was considered to &quot;not so much reflect fashion as decree it&quot;, with 800,000 loyal readers and a then famous slogan: &quot;Si elle lit, elle lit Elle (If she reads, she reads Elle)&quot;.[5] In 1981, Daniel Filipacchi and Jean-Luc LagardÃ¨re purchased Hachette magazines, which included the then-struggling Elle. Elle was then launched in the U.S. (News Corporation owned a stake in the US edition until 1988, followed by 25 other foreign editions).[citation needed] The Chinese version of the magazine was published in 1988, and is the only edition which is published twice monthly.[6]\r\n\r\nIn 2007 the website of Elle was launched.[7]\r\n\r\nAmong its past editors is Jean-Dominique Bauby, who became known for writing a book after suffering almost total paralysis.[8]\r\n\r\nElle printed special collectorsÃ¢Â€â„¢ covers for their September 2016 issue, and one of them featured Hari Nef, which was the first time an openly transgender woman had been on the cover of a major commercial British magazine\r\n\r\n=======================================\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/shtihl22\r\n\r\n=======================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3a972adddb134fefe7e85526e15af0a417e1eb4","amp;dn":"Elle+USA+-+September+2016+True+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3a972adddb134fefe7e85526e15af0a417e1eb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,169,114,173,221,177,52,254,254,126,133,82,110,21,175,10,65,126,30,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
