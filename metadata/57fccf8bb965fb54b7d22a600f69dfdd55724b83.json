His father was a diplomat in the Afghan Foreign Ministry and his mother taught Farsi and history at a high school in Kabul. In 1976, the Foreign Ministry relocated the Hosseini family to Paris. They were ready to return to Kabul in 1980, but by then their homeland had witnessed a bloody communist coup and the invasion of the Soviet Army. The Hosseinis sought and were granted political asylum in the United States, and in September 1980 moved to San Jose, California.\n\nIn March 2001, while practicing medicine, Hosseini began writing his first novel, The Kite Runner. Published by Riverhead Books in 2003, that debut went on to become an international bestseller and beloved classic, sold in at least seventy countries and spending more than a hundred weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. In May 2007, his second novel, A Thousand Splendid Suns, debuted at #1 on the New York Times bestseller list, remaining in that spot for fifteen weeks and nearly an entire year on the bestseller list. Together, the two books have sold more than 10 million copies in the United States and more than 38 million copies worldwide. The Kite Runner was adapted into a graphic novel of the same name in 2011. HosseiniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s much-awaited third novel, And the Mountains Echoed, was published on May 21, 2013.\n\nThe Kite Runner\n\nThe unforgettable, heartbreaking story of the unlikely friendship between a wealthy boy and the son of his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s servant, The Kite Runner is a beautifully crafted novel set in a country that is in the process of being destroyed. It is about the power of reading, the price of betrayal, and the possibility of redemption; and an exploration of the power of fathers over sonsÃ¢â‚¬â€their love, their sacrifices, their lies.\n\nA sweeping story of family, love, and friendship told against the devastating backdrop of the history of Afghanistan over the last thirty years, The Kite Runner is an unusual and powerful novel that has become a beloved, one-of-a-kind classic.\n\nA Thousand Splendid Suns\n\nBorn a generation apart and with very different ideas about love and family, Mariam and Laila are two women brought jarringly together by war, by loss and by fate. As they endure the ever escalating dangers around themÃ¢â‚¬â€in their home as well as in the streets of KabulÃ¢â‚¬â€they come to form a bond that makes them both sisters and mother-daughter to each other, and that will ultimately alter the course not just of their own lives but of the next generation. With heart-wrenching power and suspense, Hosseini shows how a womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s love for her family can move her to shocking and heroic acts of self-sacrifice, and that in the end it is love, or even the memory of love, that is often the key to survival.\n\nA stunning accomplishment, A Thousand Splendid Suns is a haunting, heartbreaking, compelling story of an unforgiving time, an unlikely friendship, and an indestructible love.\n\nAnd The Mountains Echoed\n\nKhaled Hosseini, the #1 New York TimesÃ¢â‚¬â€œbestselling author of The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, has written a new novel about how we love, how we take care of one another, and how the choices we make resonate through generations. In this tale revolving around not just parents and children but brothers and sisters, cousins and caretakers, Hosseini explores the many ways in which families nurture, wound, betray, honor, and sacrifice for one another; and how often we are surprised by the actions of those closest to us, at the times that matter most. Following its characters and the ramifications of their lives and choices and loves around the globeÃ¢â‚¬â€from Kabul to Paris to San Francisco to the Greek island of TinosÃ¢â‚¬â€the story expands gradually outward, becoming more emotionally complex and powerful with each turning page.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57fccf8bb965fb54b7d22a600f69dfdd55724b83","amp;dn":"Khaled+Hosseini+E-Book+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57fccf8bb965fb54b7d22a600f69dfdd55724b83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,252,207,139,185,101,251,84,183,210,42,96,15,105,223,221,85,114,75,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
