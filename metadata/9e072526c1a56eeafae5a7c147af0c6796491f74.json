She sings for television and animation series, and has recorded numerous albums, selling nearly 6 million copies.\n\nD'Avena is well-known among Italian anime fans for performing theme songs to dozens of Italian dubs of Japanese and American animated TV series. In all, she has sung nearly 120 anime themes, including theme songs for Sailor Moon, Wedding Peach, PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon, Ace o Nerae!, Touch, Ai Shite Knight, Attack No. 1, One Piece, Candy Candy, Kodocha, La Seine no Hoshi, Magic Knight Rayearth, Dr. Slump, Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water, Himitsu no Akko-chan, Little Women, Kimagure Orange Road, Attacker You!, Glass Mask, Cardcaptor Sakura and Rose of Versailles. The dubbed Italian songs she sings usually are not covers of the Japanese songs but tend to be newly written songs for the Italian dub of the anime. For the Italian dub of Mahou no Tenshi Creamy Mami, D'Avena, in addition to performing the theme songs, also dubbed the singing voices of both Creamy Mami and her rival Megumi Ayase.\n\nD'Avena has also performed themes for live-action TV series and for Western cartoon series such as Count Duckula, The Mask, My Little Pony and Friends, The Smurfs, The Snorks, Totally Spies and Jem, which became a regular staple at her live concerts. In addition to performing the theme songs, she also played Licia (Yakko-chan), the female lead of the anime Ai Shite Knight (known in Italy as Kiss Me Licia), in several live-action TV drama sequels to the anime (Love Me Licia, Teneramente Licia, and Licia, dolce Licia) which were made in Italy in response to the popularity of the anime there. Since 2000, she has sung in duet with Giorgio Vanni.\n\nIn December 2009 she released her Magia di Natale which includes 12 traditional Christmas songs, all arranged by Valeriano Chiaravalle. In this album she has sung in the English language for the first time. This album also includes a cover version of Childhood, a Michael Jackson song, in which she pays homage to the late singer.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/9027/avenagreatesthits1ns6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/9027/avenagreatesthits1ns6.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n Tracklist CD 1\n\n01 - Bambino Pinocchio (versione 2002)\n02 - Canzone dei Puffi\n03 - I ragazzi della Senna\n04 - Pollon,Pollon combinaguai\n05 - Georgie\n06 - La' sui monti con Annette\n07 - Nana' Supergirl\n08 - Kiss me Licia\n09 - Occhi di gatto\n10 - L'incantevole Creamy\n11 - Memole dolce Memole\n12 - Mila e Shiro due cuori nella pallavolo\n13 - Magica,magica Emi\n14 - David Gnomo amico mio\n15 - Alla scoperta di Babbo Natale\n16 - Pollyanna\n17 - Vola mio mini pony\n18 - Arriva Cristina\n19 - Milly un giorno dopo l'altro\n20 - D'Artagnan e i moschettieri del re\n21 - Una spada per Lady Oscar\n\nTracklist CD 2\n\n01 - Il mistero della pietra azzurra\n02 - Scuola di polizia\n03 - Cantiamo con Cristina\n04 - Tazmania\n05 - Cantiamo insieme\n06 - Fiocchi di cotone per Jeanie\n07 - Sailor Moon\n08 - Grandi uomini per grandi idee\n09 - Un oceano di avventure\n10 - Un Fiocco Per Sognare, Un Fiocco Per Cambiare\n11 - Piccoli problemi di cuore\n12 - Un incantesimo dischiuso tra i petali del tempo\n13 - Beethoven\n14 - Curiosando nei cortili del cuore\n15 - Pesca la tua carta Sakura\n16 - Sabrina\n17 - Rossana\n18 - Always Pokemon\n19 - All'arrembaggio\n20 - Ma che magie DoremÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¬!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e072526c1a56eeafae5a7c147af0c6796491f74","amp;dn":"Cristina+D%5C%27Avena+-+Greatest+Hits+%282+CD%29+%5BMp3+128+kbps%5D+TNT+Vill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e072526c1a56eeafae5a7c147af0c6796491f74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,7,37,38,193,165,110,234,250,229,167,193,71,175,12,103,150,73,31,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
