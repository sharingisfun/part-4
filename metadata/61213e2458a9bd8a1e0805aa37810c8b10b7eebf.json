It brings together elements of psychedelic rock, blues, free jazz, world music and other styles.\nThe use of improvisation, experimentation, editing and layering of sounds set a standard for Can's subsequent albums in the early 1970s, which were seminal to the freewheeling avant-garde style dubbed &quot;Krautrock&quot; by the British music press.\nMonster Movie was the only Can album on which Malcolm Mooney performed all of the vocals until Rite Time, 20 years after.\n\n\nNote: Krautrock is a German avant-garde / experimental rock movement that emerged at the end of the 1960's. The term krautrock was originally a humorous one coined by the UK music press (such as New Musical Express and Melody Maker), where &quot;krautrock&quot; found an early and enthusiastic underground following. \nJulian Cope, in his book Krautrocksampler, says &quot;Krautrock is a subjective British phenomenon,&quot; based on the way the music was received in the UK rather than on the actual West German music scene out of which it grew.  The term is also a problematic category due to the considerable differences between the artists so labelled.\nKey artists associated with the tag include Can, Amon DÃƒÂ¼ÃƒÂ¼l II, Ash Ra Tempel, Faust, Popol Vuh, Cluster, Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, Neu!, and Kraftwerk.\n\n\nStraight, no chaser.\n:)\n\n\n \n\n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61213e2458a9bd8a1e0805aa37810c8b10b7eebf","amp;dn":"CAN+-+Monster+Movie+1969+%2F+2004+Remaster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61213e2458a9bd8a1e0805aa37810c8b10b7eebf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,33,62,36,88,169,189,138,30,8,5,170,55,129,12,139,16,183,238,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
