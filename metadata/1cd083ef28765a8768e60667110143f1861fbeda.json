Ã¢â‚¬Å“Then trainers started using it with their celebrity clients. It went mainstream in Britain first, but it's picking up steam here in the States.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nEat Fast Slim is Hamilton's first solo book project. Her background as a well-established and award-winning broadcaster has given her a rare platform and profile in the health industry which extends to working with the UK government and collaborating on high-profile projects across Europe.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“What I love about fasting,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ writes Hamilton, Ã¢â‚¬Å“is its simplicity. It's much easier to watch the clock than count every calorie. In essence it is also a no-cost solution to a costly obesity problem; perfect for today's climate. It's a healthy, simple answer in an industry that has become tricky, over complicated and sometimes just downright ridiculous.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cd083ef28765a8768e60667110143f1861fbeda","amp;dn":"Eat%2C+Fast%2C+Slim%3A+The+Life-Changing+Fasting+Diet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cd083ef28765a8768e60667110143f1861fbeda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,208,131,239,40,118,90,135,104,230,6,103,17,1,67,241,134,31,190,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
