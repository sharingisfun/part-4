An important voice in American literature, O'Connor wrote two novels and 32 short stories, as well as a number of reviews and commentaries. She was a Southern writer who often wrote in a Southern Gothic style and relied heavily on regional settings and grotesque characters. O'Connor's writing also reflected her own Roman Catholic faith, and frequently examined questions of morality and ethics.\n\nHer Complete Stories won the 1972 U.S. National Book Award for Fiction and was named the &quot;Best of the National Book Awards&quot; by internet visitors in 2009.\n\n--------\n\nMany thanks to the original uploaders.\n\n--------\n\nFor other Flannery O'Connor uploads, see the following:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8664865&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8664865&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8664847&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8664847&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8653861&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8653861&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8652597&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8652597&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caf22244e668ec66e3ca49331877f673342c598f","amp;dn":"Flannery+O%27Connor+-+7+books+%28epub%2C+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caf22244e668ec66e3ca49331877f673342c598f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,242,34,68,230,104,236,102,227,202,73,51,24,119,246,115,52,44,89,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
