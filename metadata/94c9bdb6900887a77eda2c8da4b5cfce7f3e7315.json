On a quest to fulfill a friend's last wish, Joe takes to the desert road on his 1957 Harley-Davidson and meets a succession of odd characters, including Sam. Sam begins following Joe, on a quest of his own, which necessitates staying in Motel 9's wherever they go. Themes such as friendship, faith, and isolation are brought into sharp relief by strange situations, the lonely road, and the stark emptiness of the desert. There are also several humorous cameos.\n\nDirected and written by Abbe Wool\n\nEnjoy!\n\niseedforever\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94c9bdb6900887a77eda2c8da4b5cfce7f3e7315","amp;dn":"Roadside+Prophets+%281992%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94c9bdb6900887a77eda2c8da4b5cfce7f3e7315","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,201,189,182,144,8,135,167,126,218,44,141,164,181,207,206,127,62,115,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
