One day, they are sent to the town of Ceazontania, where abnormal aer activity has reportedly caused the proliferation of horribly mutated beasts, with serious threat for the whole region.\n\nMeanwhile, the Knights Supreme Commander Alexei Denoia and the naive Princess Estellise are involved in a behind-the-curtains struggle for power in the capital. The situation in Ceazontania deteriorates as the garrison of Imperial Knights finds that they cannot expect any immediate support from the capital.\n\nThen, Niren Fedrok, commander of the Imperial Knights in Ceazontania, takes an unexpected decision that is going to change Yuri and FlynnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s destiny forever.\n\nWhat are the secrets behind the extraordinary events that are happening around Yuri and Flynn? Will they be able to defend the innocent people of Ceazontania and stay true to their beliefs?\n\nContainer...........................Matroska\nFile size ...........................: 2.8GB\nOverall bit rate ..................:-3700Kbps\nWidth ................................: 1280\nHeight ...............................: 720\nDisplay aspect ratio .............: 16:9\nAudio Track 01....................
