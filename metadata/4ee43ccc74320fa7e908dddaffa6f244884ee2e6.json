But the material here wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have fit on any of the previous albums, yet here it pieces together like a jigsaw puzzle. It goes from ethereal to frantic to electrifying soloing. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s even a blues tune. It ranges from funk to spooky ambience to driving jams, with extreme dedication to locating a very specific groove.\n\nAnd of all the albums Miles Davis released then, the only one to capture the entire freewheeling sense of change and exploration is still Ã¢â‚¬Å“Get Up With ItÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. \nEssential, a must-have.\n\n\nMiles Davis\n\nGet Up With It\n\n1974\n  \n\n 2 CDs / 2000 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist / Disc 1:\n\n1.
