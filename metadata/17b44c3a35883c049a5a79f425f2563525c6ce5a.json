Consequently, many amateur astronomers miss out on some of the most fascinating aspects of the subject. Astrophysics Is Easy! cuts through the difficult mathematics and explains the basics of astrophysics in accessible terms. Using nothing more than plain arithmetic and simple examples, the workings of the universe are outlined in a straightforward yet detailed and easy-to-grasp manner.\n\nThe original edition of the book was written over eight years ago, and in that time, advances in observational astronomy have led to new and significant changes to the theories of astrophysics. The new theories will be reflected in both the new and expanded chapters.\n\nA unique aspect of this book is that, for each topic under discussion, an observing list is included so that observers can actually see for themselves the concepts presented Ã¢â‚¬â€œstars of the spectral sequence, nebulae, galaxies, even black holes. The observing list has been revised and brought up-to-date in the Second Edition.\n\nTable of contents :\nTools of the Trade....Pages 1-31\nThe Solar System....Pages 33-56\nSpectroscopy and the Spectral Sequence....Pages 57-76\nThe Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram....Pages 77-84\nThe Interstellar Medium and Protostars....Pages 85-107\nStar Birth....Pages 109-121\nGalactic Clusters and Stellar Associations....Pages 123-137\nThe Sun, Our Nearest Star....Pages 139-146\nBinary Stars and Stellar Mass....Pages 147-153\nLife on the Main Sequence....Pages 155-181\nStar Death: White Dwarfs &amp; Planetary Nebulae....Pages 183-201\nStar Death: Supernovae, Neutron Stars &amp; Black Holes....Pages 203-223\nExoplanets....Pages 225-238\nGalaxies....Pages 239-258\nActive Galaxies....Pages 259-270\nCosmology....Pages 271-291\nBack Matter....Pages 293-302","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17b44c3a35883c049a5a79f425f2563525c6ce5a","amp;dn":"Astrophysics+Is+Easy%21+An+Introduction+for+the+Amateur+Astronomer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17b44c3a35883c049a5a79f425f2563525c6ce5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,180,76,58,53,136,60,4,154,90,121,244,37,242,86,53,37,198,206,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
