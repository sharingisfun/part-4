Ã¢â‚¬Å“Schoolboy BluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ a.k.a Ã¢â‚¬Å“C*cksucker BluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½: \nWhen The Rolling Stones decided to leave Decca Records and start their own label (Rolling Stones Records) in 1970, Decca informed them that their contract obliged them to deliver one more single. The Stones complied by handing over the unreleasable &quot;Schoolboy Blues,&quot; also known as &quot;C*cksucker BluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\nStrangely enough, the song was eventually released by Decca in Germany, as a bonus single included with the 1983 four-LP boxed set Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Rest of the BestÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. This bonus record never came with a sleeve. (Bootleg singles of the song have been issued with a sleeve). Plain cover, plain record label, withdrawn in weeks after the box was put in the shops.\n\n\n2. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Brown SugarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Alt. Version with Eric Clapton): \nThis alternative version was recorded on December 18th 1970, at Olympic Studios in London, after (or during) a birthday party for Keith Richards. It features appearances by Al Kooper on piano, and Eric Clapton on slide guitar.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“If you listen to the lyrics, he sings, *Skydog Slaver, though it's always written *Scarred Old Slaver. What does that mean? Skydog is what they called Duane Allman in Muscle Shoals, because he was high all the time. And Jagger heard somebody say it and he thought it was a cool word so he used it. He was writing about literally being in the South. It was amazing to watch him do it.&quot; \n(Jim Dickinson, in Keith Richards, Life (2010)\n\n\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n\n1.\tSchoolboy Blues a.k.a.
