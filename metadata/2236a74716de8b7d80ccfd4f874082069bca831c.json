The President of France orders the case be considered of utmost urgency by the National Police, only for it to be handed down to the bumbling Inspector Albert Caponi.\n\nAdÃƒÂ¨le Blanc-Sec, a journalist and travel writer of some fame, finds herself involved after returning from Egypt, where she was searching for Ramesses II's mummified doctor/physician Patmosis. She wants to revive the mummy with the help of EspÃƒÂ©randieu so the doctor can save her sister Agathe, who is comatose following an unfortunate tennis incident involving a hatpin. After a brief struggle with her nemesis, the mysterious Professor Dieuleveult, she retrieves the mummy and returns home. Her mission is complicated further by Esperandieu being on death row, having been blamed for the pterosaur's attacks, in lieu of Inspector Caponi and celebrity big game hunter Justin de Saint-Hubert having any success in taking down the beast itself. Andrej Zborowski, a researcher at the Jardin des Plantes who is enamored with AdÃƒÂ¨le, is able to lure the pterosaur into hiding. AdÃƒÂ¨le, riding the pterosaur, rescues Esperandieu moments before his execution.\n\nSaint-Hubert fatally shoots the pterosaur along with Esperandieu, but not before Esperandieu is able to revive the mummy. The mummy ends up being the Pharaoh's physicist (&quot;I'm a nuclear physicist. I deal in figures, signs and equations.&quot;) and is unable to help her sister medically. He does, however, accompany AdÃƒÂ¨le to the MusÃƒÂ©e du Louvre, where they revive the rest of the Pharaoh's mummified court on display there, including the Pharaoh himself. The Pharaoh's doctor uses their advanced medical techniques to revive Agathe. The Pharaoh then decides he wants to see Paris, so the entire court wanders out into the night, scaring the ever-hapless Choupard yet again.\n\nAdÃƒÂ¨le decides she needs a vacation to relax. The final scene shows her boarding a ship, and the camera pans out to reveal the name of the ship, the RMS Titanic. Dieuleveult is then shown, maliciously smiling.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, MÃƒÂ©nard pursues Saint-Hubert with a rifle, still outraged that Saint-Hubert shot the pterosaur. MÃƒÂ©nard is arrested by Caponi as two gorillas stare menancingly at Saint-Hubert.\n\nFrench Language,English Subs, Enjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2236a74716de8b7d80ccfd4f874082069bca831c","amp;dn":"The+Extraordinary+Adventures+of+Ad%26egrave%3Ble+Blanc-Sec+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2236a74716de8b7d80ccfd4f874082069bca831c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,54,167,71,22,222,139,125,128,204,253,79,135,64,130,6,155,202,131,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
