Within a three-year gap between GameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s third album, LAX (2008), and his follow-up, The R.E.D. Album (2011), before the latter was finally released in August 2011. The latter album was a fall from his previous three released album sales, but became Game's third number one album on the US Billboard 200 chart. Shortly after the release of the long delayed album, Game announced he had begun work on his fifth studio album. The album was originally titled Soundtrack to Chaos, then was changed to F.I.V.E. (Fear is Victory's Evolution) and finally Jesus Piece becoming Game's first concept album. - Wikipedia - &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Piece&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Piece&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like it go buy it.
