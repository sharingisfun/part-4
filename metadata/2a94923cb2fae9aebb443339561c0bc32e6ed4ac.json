The Oxford Companion enters into this crowded field with both rigor and authority. Following in the very large footsteps of The Oxford Shakespeare (2001), this companion has the same formatting (from text lines to play names and character spellings) and is of the same stellar quality. \n\nComprising more than 3000 entries, it covers topics such as Shakespeare's biography, legend, works, literary features and terms, individuals (both real and fictional), and a host of topics such as Elizabethan and Jacobean literature and theater, which help put in context both the times and the works.\n\nOf particular note are the entries on each play, which include scene-by-scene explanations as well as examinations of the play's particular artistic features, critical history, and stage and screen history, and a listing of recent editions and selected criticism. There is enough in each play summary to aid students from middle school to college. \n\nThe attention paid to the poetic work of Shakespeare is also noteworthy. From &quot;Venus and Adonis,&quot; &quot;The Rape of Lucrece,&quot; and &quot;Lover's Complaint&quot; right through to a general section on the sonnets, the treatment is as in-depth and as helpful as that of the plays. Enlivened by photos and illustrations and an excellent map keyed to the history plays, this work is highly recommend for all libraries.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nFrom Booklist:\n\n\n&quot;It is difficult to think of a topic that is not touched upon in this new handbook designed &quot;to inform readers about Shakespeare's works, times, lives, and afterlives.&quot; As one might expect, there are entries for the plays and sonnets, sources and themes, and significant people and places in Shakespeare's life, as well as for aspects of interpretation and performance over the years. \n\n\nWhat one might not expect are entries that throw light onto obscure details (Mulberry tree; Performance times, lengths; Shakespeare Society of China; Trapdoors), as well as those for topics that at first glance seem only remotely relevant (Ceramics; Melville, Herman; Romania; Tobacco).\n\nAmong the more than 3,000 signed entries are brief identifications of every character and in-depth treatments of each play. Articles on plays are several pages long and provide background information on text and sources, followed by plot summaries and discussions of artistic features, stage history, and screen presentations. Other entries cover biographical details, literary and cultural context, publishing history, literary terms, criticism, and scholarship. \n\n\nParticular emphasis is placed on theatrical history, from the productions of Shakespeare's time to Royal Shakespeare Company, Silent films, and Television. Notable players, from Thomas Betterton (1635-1710), &quot;the greatest actor of the Restoration period,&quot; to Kenneth Branagh, Judi Dench, and Ian McKellen are included. Also represented are countries and regions, among them Arab world, Japan, and Scandinavia. \n\n\nMost entries are quite short, but broader topics, such as Music, Nineteenth-century Shakespearian production, and Trade, travel, and colonialism, are given at least a page. Many entries conclude with a brief list of resources. A detailed &quot;Thematic Listing of Entries&quot; helps compensate for the paucity of cross-references. Among other supplemental aids are a chronology and a bibliographic essay noting introductory studies and standard reference works.\n\nIts embrace of all things Shakespearian makes this volume a necessity for academic and public libraries.&quot;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a94923cb2fae9aebb443339561c0bc32e6ed4ac","amp;dn":"The+Oxford+Companion+to+Shakespeare+%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a94923cb2fae9aebb443339561c0bc32e6ed4ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,148,146,60,178,250,233,174,187,68,51,57,86,28,11,195,46,110,212,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
