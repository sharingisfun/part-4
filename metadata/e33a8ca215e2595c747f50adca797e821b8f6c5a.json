In this book, Song Y. Yang combines knowledge of these two critical fields, providing a unified view of the relationships between computational number theory and cryptography. The author takes an innovative approach, presenting mathematical ideas first, thereupon treating cryptography as an immediate application of the mathematical concepts. The book also presents topics from number theory, which are relevant for applications in public-key cryptography, as well as modern topics, such as coding and lattice based cryptography for post-quantum cryptography. The author further covers the current research and applications for common cryptographic algorithms, describing the mathematical problems behind these applications in a manner accessible to computer scientists and engineers.\n\nMakes mathematical problems accessible to computer scientists and engineers by showing their immediate application\nPresents topics from number theory relevant for public-key cryptography applications\nCovers modern topics such as coding and lattice based cryptography for post-quantum cryptography\nStarts with the basics, then goes into applications and areas of active research\nGeared at a global audience; classroom tested in North America, Europe, and Asia\nIncudes exercises in every chapter\nInstructor resources available on the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Companion Website\n\nComputational Number Theory and Modern Cryptography is ideal for graduate and advanced undergraduate students in computer science, communications engineering, cryptography and mathematics. Computer scientists, practicing cryptographers, and other professionals involved in various security schemes will also find this book to be a helpful reference.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPDF: 424 pages\nPublisher: Wiley; 1 edition (January 29, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1118188586\nISBN-13: 978-1118188583\nAmazon Link:\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e33a8ca215e2595c747f50adca797e821b8f6c5a","amp;dn":"Computational+Number+Theory+and+Modern+Cryptography+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e33a8ca215e2595c747f50adca797e821b8f6c5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,58,140,162,21,226,89,92,116,127,80,173,202,121,126,130,27,143,108,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
