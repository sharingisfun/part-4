Reduced in size, making it light and highly portable, this new mini edition presents the same easy-to-use alphabetical guide to 500 of the world's greatest painters and sculptors. 500 color illustrations.\n\nPS. Book was poorly scanned, blue cast allover, I just got it through Photoshop automatically (Auto color) and it got better. It needs more fine tuning, page by page and some paintings more lighten up, but I dont have a time for that. Book is very usefull and informative - Artist per page ..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:117c84432845ce94f5372e4d137445f904dad04b","amp;dn":"The+Art+Book+by+Phaidon.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"117c84432845ce94f5372e4d137445f904dad04b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,124,132,67,40,69,206,148,245,55,46,77,19,116,69,249,4,218,208,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
