This book covers leading-edge research in a cross-section of fields centering on mechanical engineering including current research data on the fracture mechanics of wood and wood-like reinforced polymers; thulium-doped fiber amplifiers; the role of microalloying elements on the microstructure of hot rolled steels; and high-strength titanium base alloys.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8129598bfdf9b4ca01bb5b19be67a687967f37da","amp;dn":"Advances+in+mechanical+engineering+research.+Volume+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8129598bfdf9b4ca01bb5b19be67a687967f37da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,41,89,139,253,249,180,202,1,187,91,25,190,103,166,135,150,127,55,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
