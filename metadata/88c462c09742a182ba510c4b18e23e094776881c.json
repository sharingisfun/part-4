Go for it! :D\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nFrom the beginning of civilization to the present day, and across all major religions and cultures, there have been documented cases of people seemingly overtaken by an unseen entity. The invading forceÃ¢â‚¬â€whether good or badÃ¢â‚¬â€appears to replace the possessor's soul with the spirit's own persona, resulting in mystifying symptoms such as levitation or other supernatural feats, speaking in tongues, and even horrific and inexplicably accelerated physical distortion and deterioration.\n\nThis is a two-volume chronological history and examination of spirit possession that addresses its phenomenological, psychological, and neurobiological aspects, and its effects on societies. Volume one reviews spirit possession from the upper Paleolithic era to modern times, while Volume two focuses on case studies and rites of exorcism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88c462c09742a182ba510c4b18e23e094776881c","amp;dn":"Spirit+Possession+and+Exorcism%2C+History%2C+Biology+%26amp%3B+Neurobiol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88c462c09742a182ba510c4b18e23e094776881c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,196,98,192,151,66,161,130,186,81,12,75,24,226,62,9,71,118,136,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
