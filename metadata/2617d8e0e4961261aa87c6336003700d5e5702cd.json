For four decades Ozzy has been a rock icon known as much for his trademark personality and offstage antics as for his music as the frontman of Black Sabbath. With his rise to fame and money and his self-esteem issues, everything eventually took a toll on Ozzy as he embarked on an epic binge that would last 40 years. Directors Mike Fleiss and Mike Piscitelli spent two years on the road with Ozzy. Live footage from his latest tour is threaded throughout, but it's Ozzy's reflections and surprising candor about himself that make up the heart of the film. Frank interviews with his family-including Kelly, Jack (also a producer of the film), and wife Sharon, who we saw on the popular television series The Osbournes, as well as his other children and siblings-don't always paint a pretty picture. But Ozzy readily admits that his crazy life, marked by decades-long battles against addiction, affected his role as a husband and father. His life and career have had their ups and downs, and this definitive bio-doc is a testament to his survival.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d09db1b9be909ce3fee0&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1689 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 94mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 1\n * Part Size: average 1.10 GB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sky.com/tv/show/god-bless-ozzy-osbourne&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sky.com/tv/show/god-bless-ozzy-osbourne&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Black%20Sabbath%3A%20Paranoid&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Black%20Sabbath%3A%20Paranoid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=How%20the%20Brits%20Rocked%20America%3A%20Go%20West&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=How%20the%20Brits%20Rocked%20America%3A%20Go%20West&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2617d8e0e4961261aa87c6336003700d5e5702cd","amp;dn":"BSkyB+God+Bless+Ozzy+Osbourne+PDTV+x264+AAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2617d8e0e4961261aa87c6336003700d5e5702cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,23,216,224,228,150,18,97,170,135,198,51,96,3,112,13,94,87,2,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
