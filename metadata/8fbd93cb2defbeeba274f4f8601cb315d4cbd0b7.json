The group currently comprises Rob Thomas (lead vocals, piano), Paul Doucette (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Brian Yale (bass guitar), Kyle Cook (lead guitar, backing vocals) and Ryan MacMillan (drums, percussion).\nMatchbox Twenty rose to international fame with their debut album, Yourself or Someone Like You (1996), which was certified diamond in the United States and multi-platinum in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Their second album, Mad Season, released in 2000, charted in the top three on the Billboard 200 and was certified 4ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ platinum in the United States. Their third album, More Than You Think You Are, released in 2002, was certified double platinum in the United States. However, it was not as successful as the previous two albums, despite its singles receiving significant airplay.\nThe band then went on hiatus in 2004, and rhythm guitarist Adam Gaynor left the band in 2005, after performing on the first three studio albums. As a result, Paul Doucette took over rhythm guitar, and the band reunited and released a compilation album, Exile on Mainstream, in 2007, which was certified gold in the United States. After the release, former Push Stars drummer Ryan MacMillan filled Doucette's vacated drum spot. Matchbox Twenty then took another hiatus, but reunited again in 2011 and are currently recording their fifth album, which according to Paul Doucette, will be released in 2012.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fbd93cb2defbeeba274f4f8601cb315d4cbd0b7","amp;dn":"Matchbox+Twenty+-+Studio+Discography+%28320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fbd93cb2defbeeba274f4f8601cb315d4cbd0b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,189,147,203,45,239,190,235,162,116,244,248,96,28,179,21,212,203,208,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
