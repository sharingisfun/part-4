The army sends reservists, mostly married middle-aged men - and the local beauty Andula, spurns those bold enough to try to win her, for the jazz pianist, newly come from Prague to perform. He seduces her and impresses her, telling her &quot;most women are round, like guitars but you are a guitar by Picasso&quot;. Staying the night with him causes a lecture on a young woman's honour at her hostel so she throws over her other suitors and makes her way to Prague to find the young man. His protective Mamma and weary Pappa are not pleased when she arrives on the doorstep with her suitcase. \n\nRip Specs (DVD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : LÃƒÂ¡sky JednÃƒÂ© PlavovlÃƒÂ¡sky AKA The Loves of a Blonde.1965.CriterionDVDRip.x264.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 484 Kbps\nLength            : 1.48 GiB for 1h 25mn 5s 17ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 2 287 Kbps\nAspect            : 704 x 530 (1.328) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 1 channel, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : cs\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #2           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : pt\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059415/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059415/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio Language: Czech\nSubtitles: English, Spanish, Portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1707efa062e2593f4e96698a842a1b970f1815ae","amp;dn":"The+Loves+of+a+Blonde.1965.CriterionDVDRip.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1707efa062e2593f4e96698a842a1b970f1815ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,7,239,160,98,226,89,63,78,150,105,138,132,42,27,151,15,24,21,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
