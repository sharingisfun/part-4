Part Freakonomics and part Moneyball, Fightnomics is a statistical spotlight on the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and the fighters who compete in the Octagon.\n\nDoes size matter?\n\nIs the Southpaw Advantage real for MMA?\n\nIs it better to be young or experienced in a fight?\n\nHow is the UFC Tale of the Tape lying to us?\n\nWhat makes a strike significant?\n\nWhat about Ring Rust, Octagon Jitters, or the Home Cage Advantage?\n\nJust how accurate are betting odds?\n\nTheories about how MMA works get put to the test with a little bit of science, and a whole lot of numbers. Fightnomics is the deepest and most complete analysis to date of historical UFC data that answers common, yet hotly debated questions about the sport. The fight game will never quite look the same once you've learned what really matters in a cage fight, and even a few surprising things that don't.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80b17754435ccf1012c1f24e5cd908354ae475e8","amp;dn":"Fightnomics+-+The+Hidden+Numbers+In+Mixed+Martial+Arts+And+Why+T","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80b17754435ccf1012c1f24e5cd908354ae475e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,177,119,84,67,92,207,16,18,193,242,78,92,217,8,53,74,228,117,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
