There has never been a book that reveals the secret tradecraft techniques used by spies the world over. Until now. \n\nIntelligence in the field of counter-terrorism is a different and, in many aspects, arduous and dangerous task. The lives of many agents are in continuous danger. The rules of the game are cruelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as moral and ethical considerations are negated by the bullet. There is no honor between rivals on the streets of Beirut or BaghdadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½only the most quickwitted survive. A modern spy must blend in, live among the enemy, speak the language, befriend, and exploit the enemy at very opportunity. They are required to be streetwise, rough, tough, and ruthless. \n\nThe Spycraft Manual is a step-by-step instruction book on the tradecraft and skills that spies use. Each individual subject contains masses of fascinating, previously undisclosed information, all graphically illustrated with simple black and white line drawings. From the seven basic drills of agent contact to satellite surveillance, The Spycraft Manual is a perfect reference to the whole world of espionage.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d248cfda625284e6661168ca165bebe5cf756c1","amp;dn":"The+Spycraft+Manual%3A+The+Insider%5C%27s+Guide+to+Espionage+Technique","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d248cfda625284e6661168ca165bebe5cf756c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,36,140,253,166,37,40,78,102,97,22,140,161,101,190,190,92,247,86,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
