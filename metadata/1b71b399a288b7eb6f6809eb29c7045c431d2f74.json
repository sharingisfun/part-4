Abundance for all is within our grasp. This bold, contrarian view, backed up by exhaustive research, introduces our near-term future, where exponentially growing technologies and three other powerful forces are conspiring to better the lives of billions of people. This book is an antidote to pessimism by tech-entrepreneur-turned-philanthropist Peter H. Diamandis and award-winning science writer Steven Kotler. Since the dawn of humanity, a privileged few have lived in stark contrast to the hardscrabble majority. Conventional wisdom says this gap cannot be closed. But it is closing-fast. The authors document how four forces-exponential technologies, the DIY innovator, the Technophilanthropist, and the Rising Billion-are conspiring to solve our biggest problems. Abundance establishes hard targets for change and lays out a strategic road map for governments, industry, and entrepreneurs, giving us plenty of reason for optimism.Examining human need by category-water, food, energy, health care, education, and freedom-Diamandis and Kotler introduce dozens of innovators making great strides in each area: Larry Page, Steven Hawking, Dean Kamen, Daniel Kahneman, Elon Musk, Bill Joy, Stewart Brand, Jeff Skoll, Ray Kurzweil, Ratan Tata, Craig Venter, and many, many others.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b71b399a288b7eb6f6809eb29c7045c431d2f74","amp;dn":"Abundance%3A+The+Future+Is+Better+Than+You+Think+Audiobook+-+Peter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b71b399a288b7eb6f6809eb29c7045c431d2f74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,113,179,153,162,136,183,235,111,104,9,235,41,199,4,92,67,29,47,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
