But modern times have forced the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tribes into a shared space, resulting in epic clashes of values along with unprecedented opportunities. As the world shrinks, the moral lines that divide us become more salient and more puzzling. We fight over everything from tax codes to gay marriage to global warming, and we wonder where, if at all, we can find our common ground.\n\nA grand synthesis of neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy, Moral Tribes reveals the underlying causes of modern conflict and lights the way forward. Greene compares the human brain to a dual-mode camera, with point-and-shoot automatic settings (Ã¢â‚¬Å“portrait,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“landscapeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) as well as a manual mode. Our point-and-shoot settings are our emotionsÃ¢â‚¬â€efficient, automated programs honed by evolution, culture, and personal experience. The brainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s manual mode is its capacity for deliberate reasoning, which makes our thinking flexible. Point-and-shoot emotions make us social animals, turning Me into Us. But they also make us tribal animals, turning Us against Them. Our tribal emotions make us fightÃ¢â‚¬â€sometimes with bombs, sometimes with wordsÃ¢â‚¬â€often with life-and-death stakes.\n\nAn award-winning teacher and scientist, Greene directs Harvard UniversityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Moral Cognition Lab, which uses cutting-edge neuroscience and cognitive techniques to understand how people really make moral decisions. Combining insights from the lab with lessons from decades of social science and centuries of philosophy, the great question of Moral Tribes is this: How can we get along with Them when what they want feels so wrong to Us?\n\nUltimately, Greene offers a set of maxims for navigating the modern moral terrain, a practical road map for solving problems and living better lives. Moral Tribes shows us when to trust our instincts, when to reason, and how the right kind of reasoning can move us forward.\n\nA major achievement from a rising star in a new scientific field, Moral Tribes will refashion your deepest beliefs about how moral thinking works and how it can work better.&quot;\n\nReviews:\n&quot;Surprising and remarkableÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Toggling between big ideas, technical details, and his personal intellectual journey, Greene writes a thesis suitable to both airplane reading and PhD seminarsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Moral Tribes offers a psychology far beyond the realm of self-help, instead probing the intricacy and complexity of morality in an attempt to help, and perhaps unite, entire communities.&quot; -The Boston Globe\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“With a humorous, relaxed tone, Greene stacks piles of evidence from well-researched studies onto his theory of modern-day morality. Having spent most of his academic career on the study of morality, Greene foresees the questions his readers have and systematically addresses every doubt and concern. As he mixes 20th-century philosophical moral treatises with neuroscience and psychological studiesÃ¢â‚¬â€many of which were undertaken by his colleagues in the field of moral psychologyÃ¢â‚¬â€GreeneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s role as educator shines through; his writing is clear and his examples simple yet intriguing.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ -Publisher's Weekly\n\nThis torrent contains the original retail EPUB as well as conversions into MOBI, AZW3, LIT, and large print PDF formats done in Calibre.
