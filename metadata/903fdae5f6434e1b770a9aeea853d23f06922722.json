Birmingham, a skilled impersonator, is generally known for parodying Australian sports commentators\\&amp;#039; voices. As befits the name (a reference to the non-playing reserve in a cricket side), Birmingham particularly focuses on cricket commentators such as Richie Benaud, Bill Lawry and Tony Greig. This is also due to the fact that many of Australia\\&amp;#039;s cricket commentators have distinctive and easily-identifiable voices and accents.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:903fdae5f6434e1b770a9aeea853d23f06922722","amp;dn":"The+12th+Man+Discography+MP3+%28Extracted%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"903fdae5f6434e1b770a9aeea853d23f06922722","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,63,218,229,246,67,78,27,119,10,154,238,168,83,210,63,6,146,39,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
