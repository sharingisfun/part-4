Listen for 30 minutes a day before bed time to help put your mind into the Theta state and make dreams more vivid and lucid. I usually listen after meditation.  Read about binaurals and how they work, it's really intense. When I listen to this my body gets really heavy, its pretty weird.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af11b495ccbd90c0894470218a3b2c493e8ed72d","amp;dn":"Lucid+Dream+Binaural+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af11b495ccbd90c0894470218a3b2c493e8ed72d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,17,180,149,204,189,144,192,137,68,112,33,138,59,44,73,62,142,215,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
