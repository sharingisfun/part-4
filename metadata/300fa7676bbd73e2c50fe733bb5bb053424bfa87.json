The cornerstone of  the Islamic economic system is the condemnation and prohibition of usury. The Qur'an contains many verses that condemn usury in the most strongest language. In Surah # 2, Verses 275-280 we read the following:\n\n2:275  But those who take usury will rise up on the Day of Resurrection like someone tormented by SatanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s touch. That is because they say, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Trade and usury are the\nsame,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ \n2:276  but God has allowed trade and forbidden usury. Whoever, on receiving GodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s warning, stops taking usury may keep his past gainsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ God will be his judgeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but whoever goes back to usury will be an inhabitant of the Fire, there to remain. God blights usury, but blesses charitable deeds with multiple increase: He does not love the ungrateful sinner. \n2:277  Those who believe, do good deeds, keep up the prayer, and pay the prescribed alms will have their reward with their Lord: no fear for them, nor will they grieve. \n2:278  You who believe, beware of God: give up any outstanding dues from usury, if you \ntrue believers. \n2:279  If you do not, then be warned of war from God and His Messenger. You shall have your capital if you repent, and without suffering loss or causing others to suffer loss. \n2:280  If the debtor is in difficulty, then delay things until matters become easier for him; still, if you were to write it off as an act of charity, that would be better for you, if only you knew. \n\n\nand in Surah #3, Verse 130, we read:\n\n3:130  You who believe, do not consume usurious interest, doubled and redoubled. Be mindful of God so that you may prosperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“\n\n\nand in Surah #30, Verse 39, we read:\n\n30:39  Whatever you lend out in usury to gain value through other peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wealth will not increase in GodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eyes, but whatever  you give in charity, in your desire for GodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s approval, will earn multiple rewards.\n\n\nThis upload contains 33 titles.
