For each area studied there are only so many questions an examiner can ask; they are presented here with clear explanations that allow the student to revise thoroughly one topic at a time. \n\nWhile doing so the student can also practise their exam technique. Each book includes MCQs, EMQs, SAQs and Problem-based Questions - exactly the kind of questions they will get in their exams.\n\nIllustrated with simple, easy-to-reproduce line drawings, medical students have in this one volume all that they need for exam success.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2e4eb7adba01d64c5417b80cfc0025e371ca5eb","amp;dn":"One+Stop+Doc+Statistics+and+Epidemiology+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2e4eb7adba01d64c5417b80cfc0025e371ca5eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,228,235,122,219,160,29,100,197,65,123,128,207,192,2,94,55,28,165,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
