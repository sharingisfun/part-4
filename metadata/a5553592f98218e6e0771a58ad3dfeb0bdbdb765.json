He originally wrote this EP as a belated Valentine&amp;#039;s Day present for his girlfriend. She must have liked what she heard (although it&amp;#039;s not too romantic that Passion Pit is also the name of a Traci Lords/John Holmes skin flick from the &amp;#039;80s), because Angelakos started making more copies of the EP and handing them out to friends and acquaintances. Eventually so many people liked what they heard that Passion Pit (which Angelakos fleshes out to a full band when Passion Pit plays live) was voted Best New Local Act in a 2008 WFNX/Boston Phoenix Best Music Poll. The original version of Chunk of Change is augmented here by two additional tracks, &quot;Sleepyhead&quot; and &quot;Better Things.&quot;\n\n***\n\nBand:\n\nLabel: http://frenchkissrecords.com ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5553592f98218e6e0771a58ad3dfeb0bdbdb765","amp;dn":"Passion+Pit+-+Chunk+Of+Change+%5B2008%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5553592f98218e6e0771a58ad3dfeb0bdbdb765","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,85,53,146,249,130,24,230,224,119,26,88,173,61,254,176,189,189,183,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
