Andrea's alarmed at the slow building progress at the new Liberty Belle Skin Centre given she's planning a launch party and Janet's reworking her increasingly expensive renovations at Red Hill. Andrea hosts a tennis day at her luxury beach house on the Mornington Peninsula. Everything starts off swimmingly but its game, set and match when one of the girls arrives late. Jackie suggests a late night salsa lesson to diffuse the tension but will it prove healing?\nIf you see &quot;Hector&quot; on the end of a file it means I capped it.\nEnjoy, Gaz/Hector :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9acba6608a08a26d797052ae9478bb4b3b4d106","amp;dn":"Real.Housewives.of.Melbourne.s01e06.PDTV.x264.Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9acba6608a08a26d797052ae9478bb4b3b4d106","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,172,186,102,8,160,138,38,215,151,5,42,233,71,139,180,179,180,209,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
