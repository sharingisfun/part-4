It was released on March 22,\n2011 by WaterTower Music. The album consists of covered songs, mainly by the film's stars.\nEmily Browning sings three songs, and Carla Gugino and Oscar Isaac performs a cover of\n&quot;Love Is the Drug&quot; as a duet. Recording artists Bjork, Skunk Anansie, EmilÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­ana Torrini,\nQueen, Carla Azar, Alison Mosshart and Yoav also have songs on the soundtrack.\n\nAll of the covers on the album were produced by Marius de Vries and Tyler Bates, who\nutilized orchestral and rock sounds. Director Zack Snyder wanted the songs to add depth,\ndimension and meaning to the fantasy aspects of the film. The recording sessions began in\nSeptember 2009. Part of Browning's audition for her role in the film included recording herself\nwhile singing. Snyder liked her voice and offered her to sing The Smiths' song &quot;Asleep&quot;. The\ncrew and Smiths' frontman Morrissey were happy with the result, and Browning recorded two\nmore songs for the soundtrack, including &quot;Sweet Dreams [Are Made of This]&quot; which is played\nduring the film's opening sequence.\n\nThe album received generally positive reviews. Critics considered it one of the best\nsoundtracks of the year, although the rap by Armageddon in the mash-up of Queen's &quot;I Want\nIt All&quot; and &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; was cited as the album's bad point. Browning was praised for\nher performance throughout the album, mainly on &quot;Sweet Dreams [Are Made of This]&quot;.\nSucker Punch reached number twenty-two on the Billboard 200, and the top of the Top\nSoundtracks chart. Internationally, the album reached the top fifty in Australia, New Zealand,\nAustria and Germany.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucker_Punch_(soundtrack)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucker_Punch_(soundtrack)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n   1 - Emily Browning - Sweet Dreams [Are Made of This] [Eurythmics cover]                            [05:18]\n   2 - Bjork [feat Skunk Anansie] - Army of Me [Sucker Punch Remix]                                   [06:50]\n   3 - Emiliana Torrini - White Rabbit [Jefferson Airplane cover]                                     [05:08]\n   4 - Queen w Armageddon aka Geddy - I Want It All / We Will Rock You Mash / Armageddon [Queen cover][05:08]\n   5 - Skunk Anansie - Search and Destroy [Stooges cover]                                             [04:25]\n   6 - Alison Mosshart and Carla Azar - Tomorrow Never Knows [Beatles cover]                          [07:35]\n   7 - Yoav [feat Emily Browning] - Where Is My Mind [Pixies cover]                                   [06:11]\n   8 - Emily Browning - Asleep [Smiths cover]                                                         [04:23]\n   9 - Oscar Isaac and Carla Gugino - Love Is the Drug [Roxy Music cover]                             [04:12]\n\n\n\nPlaying Time.........: 49:14\nTotal Size...........: 313.75 MB\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/46983578468815261925.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/46983578468815261925.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e0d13b1f07b9806a6f565075f214aae8b270e38","amp;dn":"Sucker+Punch+OST+2011+%5BEAC+-+FLAC+-+LYRICS%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e0d13b1f07b9806a6f565075f214aae8b270e38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,13,19,177,240,123,152,6,166,245,101,7,95,33,74,174,139,39,14,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
