So it sounds a lot better than the original version on both PC and PSX\n\nWhy ?\n\nBecause I'm a big fan of N. Uematsu  :-D\n\nUsage ?\n\nYou can try this with the amazing Ficedula's FFVII Music or just listen to it if you are a fan of the music\n\nPLEASE NOTE:\n\n1. I will not give any kind of tech-related support for software (search the forums)\n2. These tracks will not loop correctly in FF7 due lack of cue support in mp3\n3. These tracks are not meant as a remix so they will stop abruptly since there based on the original MIDI (which has looping fonction)\n\n*** Here is a small word from FinalFanTim:***\n\n&quot;I gave it my all to let [the tracks] all sound the way i felt when i first played FFVII on the PSX.\nThe problem is...MIDI instruments don't always sound as real instruments...so i had to deal with complicated stuff like different velocities, volumes, reverb, panning and convert that to real instruments.\nAnd i lack the studio monitors for better sound control/mastering so the music will not sound the same with everybody because of changes in type of speakers, configurations etc.&quot;\n\n--------------------------------------\nAll 320Kbs, All tagged, Seeded on TPB by eiki a.k.a eikimono\n\nUPDATE: sorry for all the leechers: as the precedent torrent file was corrupted I had to fix it and I hope now everything's ok.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7485e4ed399f1bf8da3d2f6b32f4acd07d27dcc9","amp;dn":"Final+Fantasy+7+OST+%5BRemastered+Edition%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7485e4ed399f1bf8da3d2f6b32f4acd07d27dcc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,133,228,237,57,159,27,248,218,61,47,107,50,244,172,208,125,39,220,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
