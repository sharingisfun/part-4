Since going solo, the former Screaming Trees frontman has attracted a cult following, but if a man can be judged by the stature of his friends, then surely Bubblegum marks the beginning of Lanegan's turn in the spotlight. Featuring such high-profile guests including PJ Harvey (&amp;quot;Hit the City&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Come to Me&amp;quot;), Guns n'Roses / Velvet Revolver's Izzy Stradlin and Duff McKagan (&amp;quot;Strange Religion&amp;quot;), Afghan Whigs / Twilight Singers' frontman Greg Dulli (&amp;quot;Methamphetamine Blues&amp;quot;) and Masters of Reality's Chris Goss (who shares production credits, as well as appearing on a number of songs), the songs on Bubblegum display a breadth of style that matches Lanegan's trademark depth of substance. And though he kept his profile comparatively low as a longterm collaborator with Queens of the Stone Age, his two bandmates Josh Homme and Nick Oliveri feature heavily throughout (Homme, in particular, plays guitar or drums on five of the tracks here). But this is by no means a QOTSA album. Bubblegum has a sound all its own, and Lanegan is firmly at the helm, with his gravelly voice and sombre observations making him sound more and more like Tom Waits. Its pleasures may not be immediate to all listeners, but once found, they're difficult to shake. --Robert Burrow\n------------------------------\n\nFile list:\nMark Lanegan Band - Bubblegum (2004) folder.jpg\nMark Lanegan Band - Bubblegum (2004).m3u\nMark Lanegan Band - Bubblegum - 01 - When Your Number Isn't Up.mp3\nMark Lanegan Band - Bubblegum - 02 - Hit The City (Feat Pj Harvey).mp3\nMark Lanegan Band - Bubblegum - 03 - Wedding Dress.mp3\nMark Lanegan Band - Bubblegum - 04 - Methamphetamine Blues (Feat Josh Homme).mp3\nMark Lanegan Band - Bubblegum - 05 - One Hundred Days.mp3\nMark Lanegan Band - Bubblegum - 06 - Bombed.mp3\nMark Lanegan Band - Bubblegum - 07 - Strange Religion (Feat Izzy Stradlin And Duff Mckagan).mp3\nMark Lanegan Band - Bubblegum - 08 - Sideways In Reverse.mp3\nMark Lanegan Band - Bubblegum - 09 - Come To Me (Feat Pj Harvey).mp3\nMark Lanegan Band - Bubblegum - 10 - Like Little Willie John.mp3\nMark Lanegan Band - Bubblegum - 11 - Can't Come Down.mp3\nMark Lanegan Band - Bubblegum - 12 - Morning Glory Wine.mp3\nMark Lanegan Band - Bubblegum - 13 - Head.mp3\nMark Lanegan Band - Bubblegum - 14 - Driving Death Valley Blues.mp3\nMark Lanegan Band - Bubblegum - 15 - Out Of Nowhere.mp3\nMark Lanegan Band - Bubblegum (2004) (Mp3@vbr).sfv\nMark Lanegan Band - Bubblegum (2004) AMG review.txt\n-----------------------------------\n\nwith tag and all - keep on seedin'/elbastardo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab6a910946ecea0443308db5c222c79b0384026e","amp;dn":"Mark+Lanegan+Band+-+Bubblegum+%282004%29+%28Mp3%40vbr%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab6a910946ecea0443308db5c222c79b0384026e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,106,145,9,70,236,234,4,67,48,141,181,194,34,199,155,3,132,2,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
