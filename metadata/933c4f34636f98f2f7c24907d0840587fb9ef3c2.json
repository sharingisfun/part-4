Formed in 1981 by Ronnie Atkins and Ken Hammer, their sound and music can be described as classic guitar-laden heavy rock with a strong emphasis on melodic elements like vocals and keyboards.\r\n\r\nOver the years, Pretty Maids have sold hundreds of thousands of records, but have never broken through in a major way, except in Japan during the 1990s. They have supported well known bands as Black Sabbath, Whitesnake, Deep Purple, Alice Cooper, and Saxon, and were also featured at the 1987 German version of Monsters of Rock, where Metallica headlined along with Deep Purple.[1]\r\n\r\nAfter a prolonged international touring hiatus before the release of the 2006 Wake Up to the Real World album, the band have every year since been touring their primary markets of Denmark, Sweden, Germany, and Spain.\r\n\r\nIn March 2014, Pretty Maids released their 13th studio album Louder Than Ever.\r\n\r\nPretty Maids Discography 1983 - 2012 ak (Size: 2.33 GB)\r\n  1983.Pretty Maids\r\n  1984.Red, Hot And Heavy\r\n  1987.Future World\r\n  1990.Jump The Gun\r\n  1992.Offside\r\n  1992.Sin-Decade\r\n  1993.Stripped\r\n  1995.Scream\r\n  1995.Screaming live\r\n  1997.Spooked\r\n  1999.Anything Worth Doing Is Worth Overdoing\r\n  1999.First Cuts...And Then Some\r\n  2000.Carpe Diem\r\n  2002.Planet Panic\r\n  2003.Live At Least\r\n  2006.Wake Up To The Real World\r\n  2010.Pandemonium\r\n  2012 - It Comes Alive [2CD]\r\n  Exclusive Photos\r\n\r\nCurrent line up\r\n\r\nRonnie Atkins (Paul Christensen) â€“ lead vocals (1981â€“present)\r\nKen Hammer (Kenneth Hansen) â€“ guitar (1981â€“present)\r\nRene Shades (Rene Sehic) â€“ bass (2004, 2011â€“present)\r\nAllan Tschicaja â€“ drums (2006â€“present)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:933c4f34636f98f2f7c24907d0840587fb9ef3c2","amp;dn":"Pretty+Maids+Discography+1983+-+2012+320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"933c4f34636f98f2f7c24907d0840587fb9ef3c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,60,79,52,99,111,152,242,247,194,73,7,208,132,5,135,251,158,243,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
