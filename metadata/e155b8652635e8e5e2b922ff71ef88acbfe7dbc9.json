Based on the wildly popular comic book series Hellblazer from DC Comics, seasoned demon hunter and master of the occult John Constantine is armed with a ferocious knowledge of the dark arts and a wickedly naughty wit. He fights the good fight - or at least he did. With his soul already damned to hell, he's decided to abandon his campaign against evil until a series of events thrusts him back into the fray when an old friend's daughter becomes the target of supernatural forces.[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e155b8652635e8e5e2b922ff71ef88acbfe7dbc9","amp;dn":"Constantine.S01E07.HDTV.x264-LOL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e155b8652635e8e5e2b922ff71ef88acbfe7dbc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,85,184,101,38,53,232,229,226,185,34,255,113,239,136,172,191,231,219,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
