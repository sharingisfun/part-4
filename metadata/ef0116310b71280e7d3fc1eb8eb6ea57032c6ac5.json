In Minnesota, Virgil Flowers gets a message from Lucas Davenport: YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re about to get a visitor. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an Israeli cop, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tailing a man whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s smuggled out an extraordinary relicÃ¢â‚¬â€a copper scroll revealing startling details about the man known as King Solomon.\n\nWait a minute, laughs Virgil. Is this one of those Da Vinci Code deals? The secret scroll, the blockbuster revelation, the teams of murderous bad guys? Should I be boning up on my Bible verses?\n\nHe looks at the cop. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not laughing. As it turns out, there are very bad men chasing the relic, and they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in the way or what they have to do to get it. Maybe Virgil should start praying.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef0116310b71280e7d3fc1eb8eb6ea57032c6ac5","amp;dn":"Storm+Front+-+John+Sanford.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef0116310b71280e7d3fc1eb8eb6ea57032c6ac5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,1,22,49,11,113,40,14,125,63,193,235,142,182,234,87,3,44,106,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
