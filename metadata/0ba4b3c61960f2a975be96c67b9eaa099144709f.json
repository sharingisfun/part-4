Coyote and the Road Runner are cartoon characters from a series of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons. The characters were created by animation director Chuck Jones in 1948 for Warner Brothers, while the template for their adventures was the work of writer Michael Maltese. The characters went on to star in a long-running series of theatrical cartoon shorts. The series consists of 45 shorts (mostly about 6-7 min.), 1 short film (26 min.), and 3 Webtoons (2-3 min.).\n\nFranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ais : Bip Bip et Coyote\nItaliano : Willy il Coyote e Bip Bip\nEspaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ol : El Coyote y el Correcaminos\nPortuguÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªs : Papa-LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©guas e Coiote\nÃƒÂ¦Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã‚Â¥ÃƒÂ¦Ã…â€œÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¨Ã‚ÂªÃ…Â¾ : ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â¯ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚ÂªÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â¼ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â»ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â³ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â¼ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ£Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â­ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â¼ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã¢â‚¬Â°ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â»ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â©ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â³ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã…Â ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â¼\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nUpdated version - This torrent contains all 45 Road Runner cartoons in high quality, the 1962 short film &quot;Adventures of the Road Runner&quot;, the Sam Sheepdog &amp; Ralph Wolf cartoons, and the Wile E.
