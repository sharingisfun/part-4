The unique properties of lasers allow for use in flexible manufacturing techniques such as laser-assisted mechanical machining (LAM) and laser-assisted chemical machining (LCM). Laser Fabrication and Machining of Materials provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental principles and emerging applications of lasers related to material removal and forming processes, and also provides a link between advanced materials and advanced processing and manufacturing techniques.\n\nLaser Fabrication and Machining of Materials introduces readers to the fundamental properties and physical phenomena of laser machining and its applications on the macro, micro, and nano scales. Examples of existing, emerging, and potential techniques are discussed, giving students and practicing engineers alike the opportunity to expand their use of lasers in such disciplines as mechanical processes, electronics, materials, and manufacturing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38f05d7ad6a227441e11953106a9163815508d3a","amp;dn":"LASER+FABRICATION+AND+MACHINING+OF+MATERIALS+%5C%22+by+narendra+b.+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38f05d7ad6a227441e11953106a9163815508d3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,240,93,122,214,162,39,68,30,17,149,49,6,169,22,56,21,80,141,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
