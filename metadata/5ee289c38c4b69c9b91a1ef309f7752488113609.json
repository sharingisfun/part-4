Since that time I have endeavored to un-lock the secrets of what makes a rocking chair comfortable so I can apply what I learn to each new rocking chair that I make. Folks who have had the pleasure of sitting in one of my chairs believe that I have succeeded in creating the most comfortable wooden chair ever made.\n\nI believe that the highest calling a person can have is to teach what they know to others who would like to learn. Following that call, I have taught, through my &quot;Rocking Chair University&quot; program, hundreds of folks how to make beautiful (and exquisitely comfortable) rocking chairs since 1996.  Many of them have gone on to make rocking chairs professionally, you can see links to their web sites on my links page.\n\nI studied biology in college earning a BS in Biology with a Chemistry minor. I ended up with a 3.5 gpa in my major. Not bad - except for the fact that I never really wanted to be a biologist! I just loved the classes. My freshman year in college I took &quot;Biology for people that don't like Biology.&quot; It's purpose was exactly as stated; for people with non science majors who just wanted to get science out of the way.  Well - the professor was brilliant and I loved every minute of the class. Consequently, when selecting classes for the following semester I looked for &quot;R. Harvard Riches&quot; in the schedule to see what else he was teaching that I could take. I found he was teaching Genetics, so I enrolled. Don't ask why a psych major was taking Genetics. Again, I loved every minute of the class and the following semester I was scanning for R. Harvard Riches again, found another class I could take and before long I had more credits in Biology than anything else,  since I was enjoying my Biology classes more than anything else, I defaulted to a Biology degree.\n\nAs soon as I graduated I went into electronics and ended up as the Manager of Electrical Engineering in a comany in Woodbridge, VA. From there I moved into Manufacturing Management, finding that I enjoyed the science of making things more than anything I had done up to that point in my life.\n\nIt is this love of  &quot;The science of making things&quot; that I bring to my students who come for seminars or purchase my books and videos. I have divided the processes of making a rocking chair into a continuous series of easy to understand and execute steps, the last of which is to &quot;turn around and have a seat in the most comfortable rocking chair you ever sat in!&quot;\n\n--------------------------------\n\nContents:\nDirectory: Hal_Taylor-Rocking_Chair_Plans\n&lt;1&gt;  Hal_Taylor-Rocking_Chair.jpg [11351]\n&lt;2&gt;  Videos/Hal_Taylor-Rocking_Chair-08-Cutting_Seat_Joints.mp4 [35364855]\n&lt;3&gt;  Videos/Hal_Taylor-Rocking_Chair-07-Making_Repairs.mp4 [24785348]\n&lt;4&gt;  Videos/Hal_Taylor-Rocking_Chair-03-Why_rout_Joints_vertically.mp4 [8570030]\n&lt;5&gt;  Videos/Hal_Taylor-Rocking_Chair-05-Planing_Headrest_to_Fit.mp4 [45654374]\n&lt;6&gt;  Videos/Hal_Taylor-Rocking_Chair-04-Front_Leg_Transition_Blocks.mp4 [19615515]\n&lt;7&gt;  Videos/Hal_Taylor-Rocking_Chair-01-Intro.mp4 [19707867]\n&lt;8&gt;  Videos/Hal_Taylor-Rocking_Chair-06-Back_Legs.mp4 [24736674]\n&lt;9&gt;  Videos/Hal_Taylor-Rocking_Chair-02-Sequence_01.mp4 [32376437]\n&lt;10&gt;  Building_the_Hal_Taylor_Rocking_Chair-Updated_Chapter_1.pdf [12710111]\n&lt;11&gt;  Building_the_Hal_Taylor_Rocking_Chair.txt [26906]\n&lt;12&gt;  Building_the_Hal_Taylor_Rocking_Chair.pdf [55464790]\nTotal: 266 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ee289c38c4b69c9b91a1ef309f7752488113609","amp;dn":"Woodworking_Plans-Building_the_Hal_Taylor_Rocking_Chair-PDF-eBoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ee289c38c4b69c9b91a1ef309f7752488113609","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,226,137,195,140,75,105,201,185,26,30,243,9,247,117,36,136,17,54,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
