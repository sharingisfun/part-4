Ford himself manages to escape and quickly surfaces to find help-but that's when his troubles only begin. \r\n\r\nTwo men are waiting for him on the shore, and they are not the kind of men you want to meet at any time. Murderers and ex-cons, they're intent on diving to the bottom of the very deep lake and uncovering the remains of a legendary plane wreck there, supposedly loaded with Cuban treasury gold. Ford's exÂ­pertise is just what they need. And if he doesn't want to help? He can die. His friends? They can die, too. In fact, they can die right now...\r\n\r\nAs the hours tick away, two mortal struggles unfold simultaÂ­neously, one above and one below. Neither outcome is certain, no man is safe... and in the deep shadow, only death awaits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b6227aaeb41de28aafb71e00e0f5487657fde6d","amp;dn":"DEEP+SHADOW+-+Randy+Wayne+White+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b6227aaeb41de28aafb71e00e0f5487657fde6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,98,39,170,235,65,222,40,170,251,113,224,14,15,84,135,101,127,222,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
