Only recently discovered, Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys have mesmerizing faces, with tiny noses, almond eyes and large pink lips that unavoidably call to mind the results of too much plastic surgery. Their elfin-like young have ears like Yoda. They are exclusive stars of their enchanted mountain valley, found not far from an ancient city named after the famous mythical paradise called Shangri-La. There are only a few thousand of them in the world.\nRepresenting the meticulous and ambitious work of an all-Chinese film company led by award-winning filmmaker, Xi Zhinong, this spectacular film is the true story of one family of these monkeys, followed by an intrepid team of filmmakers, rangers and scientists for two years. At the heart of the story are two young monkeys, half-brothers, who make their way in the world by very different paths - one protected and indulged, the other mostly a neglected and adventurous survivor. Their family is watched over by a formidable fighter and his gang who guard a troop of composed of 8-10 families. It is a unique monkey society, formed in response to the hardships of the Himalayas, enduring those hardships with a mixture of kindness, violence, cooperation and interdependence.\n \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;c38baaa4ab838ff7edf2&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 3854 Kbps (CRF 20)\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\n * Framerate: 29.970 fps\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC (Nero)\n * Audio Quality: 0.50 48KHz (~150 Kbps)\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: 52mn 58s\n * Number of Parts: 1\n * Part Size: 1.49 GiB\n * Container: MP4\n * Released: 2015\n * Source: HDTV AVC 1080i\n * Capper: KarMa\n * Subtitles: English - Merged in the MP4\n\n1)  Further Information \n * http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/mystery-monkeys-shangri-la/11728/\n\n2)  Related Documentaries \n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=Wild%20China%20%28BBC%29\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Riddle%20of%20Monkey%20Kingdom\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=Untamed%20China\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=Monkey%20Planet%20%28BBC%29\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Last%20Orangutan%20Eden\n\nSource: http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Mystery_Monkeys_of_Shangri-La","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d1b984373ffa0c022371d89087a226d398eb2fa","amp;dn":"PBS.Nature.2015.Mystery.Monkeys.of.Shangri-La.720p.HDTV.x264.MVG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d1b984373ffa0c022371d89087a226d398eb2fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,27,152,67,115,255,160,192,34,55,29,137,8,122,34,109,57,142,178,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
