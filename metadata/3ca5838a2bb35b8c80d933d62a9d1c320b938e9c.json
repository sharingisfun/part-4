A memo from J. Edgar Hoover himself states: &quot;American Army officials in Germany have not located Hitler's body nor is there any reliable source that will say definitely that Hitler is dead.&quot;\r\nWith these newly released FBI files as their guide, the team will approach this investigation in the hopes of solving the mystery surrounding the demise of one of the biggest criminals of all time. Whether they are investigating a mysterious Nazi lair deep in the Argentinian jungle or diving for evidence of a missing U-Boat that could of shuttled Hitler to South America, our team will focus on the tried and tested tactics for solving a fraudulent death case: follow the money, where was the subject last seen, eyewitness reports, make contact with known associates, and forensics.\r\nArmed with new clues and cutting edge technology, this crack team of investigators will uncover what Hitler's movements could have been after the fall of the Nazi Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3)  Escape from Berlin \r\nAfter determining that Hitler could have faked his own death, Lenny uncovers a mass Nazi exodus from Templehof airport the day after Hitler was last seen in public, and one of the planes had Hitler's personal baggage on it. Then, the team finds underground tunnels linking the Fuhrer bunker and Tempelhof Airport, where Hitler could have escaped Berlin via a plane.\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/25/Hunting-Hitler-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/82/Hunting-Hitler-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/27/Hunting-Hitler-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/26/Hunting-Hitler-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c9/Hunting-Hitler-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f4/Hunting-Hitler-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5b/Hunting-Hitler-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a8/Hunting-Hitler-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/43/Hunting-Hitler-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1a/Hunting-Hitler-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/80/Hunting-Hitler-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/91/Hunting-Hitler-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/33/Hunting-Hitler-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6b/Hunting-Hitler-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/45/Hunting-Hitler-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/99/Hunting-Hitler-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3186 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 42mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 8\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 938 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.history.co.uk/shows/hunting-hitler/episode-guide/hunting-hitler-series-1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ca5838a2bb35b8c80d933d62a9d1c320b938e9c","amp;dn":"Hunting+Hitler+Series+1+3of8+Escape+From+Berlin+720p+x264+AAC+HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ca5838a2bb35b8c80d933d62a9d1c320b938e9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,165,131,138,43,179,91,140,128,217,51,214,42,157,28,50,11,147,142,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
