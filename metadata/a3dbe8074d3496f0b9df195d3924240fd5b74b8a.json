Accompanied by his guide and faithful friend, Prabaker, Lin searches for love and meaning while running a clinic in one of the city's poorest slums and serving his apprenticeship in the dark arts of the Bombay mafia. The keys to unlock the mysteries that bind Lin are held by two people: his mentor Khader Khan, mafia godfather and criminal-philosopher, and the beautiful, elusive Karla, whose passions are driven by dangerous secrets. Based on the life of the author, this extraordinary debut has the world of human experience in its reach.\n\nMP3 CD\nPublisher: Blackstone Audio, Inc.; MP3 Unabridged edition (October 1, 2006)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 078617465X\nISBN-13: 978-0786174652\n\nHumphrey Bower (Reader)\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
