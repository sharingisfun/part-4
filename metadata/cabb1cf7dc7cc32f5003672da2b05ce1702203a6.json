Releashed Nov. 8th, 2005   \n\n\nFormat:\t      DVD5 NTSC\nLang.:\t      English\nDiscs:         1\nImage:         ISO\nRequirements:  Modded/Chipped Ps2, or Swap Magic Disc method. \n\nCompressed with Winrar.  Game was tested and works.\n\nNote: you can extract winrar formats with 7-Zip, 7-Zip is free.\n\n(You could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% &amp; the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.)\n\nIf your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first\nremove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.\n\nHere's a link for how to remove the front cover...\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.modchipstore.com/support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=49&amp;nav=0,2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.modchipstore.com/support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=49&amp;nav=0,2&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAnd here's some links on using the slide tool to open the tray to swap in your ps2 copy or backup game.\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.swapmagic3.com/slide-tool/Instructions.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.swapmagic3.com/slide-tool/Instructions.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/340944&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/340944&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/15105&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/15105&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThose that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot &amp; how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.\n\n-- &lt;a href=&quot; http://bootleg.sksapps.com/tutorials/fmcb/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://bootleg.sksapps.com/tutorials/fmcb/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).\n\nAfter patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media\nthen use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.\n\nYou will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Try Verbatim DVD+R (Booktype to DVD-ROM), or Tayio Yuden, burn at 8x if its a 16x max. You really can't use Maxell DVD+R for example or some other brand as it more than likely will not work.\n\nNote: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Try Swap Magic to load the game.\n\nQuite an awesome game and kick ass so I just had to upload it. Yes its true path of neo is already here on the pirate bay but didn't see any ntsc uploads and the other ones are dead and the only one that you can download doesn't state if its a pal or ntsc format...and actually is the pal version so here's the ntsc-usa release of the game, hope you like it. \n\nGame Description:\n\nTHE MATRIX: PATH OF NEO will enable players to actually play as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNeo,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the central character, and relive his most important and memorable scenarios from the complete film trilogy, including the original film, THE MATRIX. Throughout the game, the path the player takes to resolve each scenario and the resulting consequences will be scripted and directed by the Wachowski Brothers. The likenesses of all of the filmsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ key actors -- including Keanu Reeves (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNeoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), Laurence Fishburne (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMorpheusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), Carrie-Ann Moss (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTrinity), and Hugo Weaving (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAgent SmithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) -- will be featured in THE MATRIX: PATH OF NEO, which will also include footage from all three feature films, as well as THE ANIMATRIX.\n\n\nBurn the Iso with DVD Decrypter (Dvd Decrypter Included in download) or Nero.\n\nUse good media like Verbatim DVD+R (Booktype it to DVD-ROM) or Tayio Yuden.\n\nYou can't use cd-rw either for ps2 cd type games but you can use dvd+rw for dvd games though it is a pain in the butt to get it to load sometimes, if you even can.\n\nIt is always best to burn at a slow speed, for better quality. \nBut not to slow like 1x speed if that is even possible anymore.\n\nTry 4x or 8x burn speed settings, is your best bet on a write once disc. \n\nIf its a DVD+RW for example (rarely works) and you can get yours working with one...(try maxell dvd+rw you might get lucky) you'd burn it at 2.4x speed as most of rw only go to about 4x anyhow.\n\nMax burn speed is not recommended as you might have an increase of read errors, jitters, or choppy/slow load times. Well thats if your using dics anyways but \nif your using a harddrive for your ps2 for games well thats a different story.\n\nPlease seed this when your done, don't just leech. \n\nI can't seed this all the time 24/7.\n\nAny Problems, questions or comments please don't hestiate to post them.\n\n\nIf you can considerator supporting the pirate bay by donating to them thru the 'contact us' on the website scroll down to donations. Even $5 or $10 dollars is good enough (of course more is better). Do the math and even if a small percentage of people donate will help. This helps them to stay afloat and keep the site running while defending from the all the unnecessary legal bull-crap they receive.\n\n\nEnjoy the Game!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cabb1cf7dc7cc32f5003672da2b05ce1702203a6","amp;dn":"Matrix+Path+of+Neo+%5BNtsc%5D+Ps2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cabb1cf7dc7cc32f5003672da2b05ce1702203a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,187,28,247,220,124,195,47,80,3,103,45,162,176,92,225,112,34,3,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
