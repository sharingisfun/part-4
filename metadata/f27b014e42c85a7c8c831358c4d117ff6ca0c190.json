The Hacker Playbook provides them their own game plans. Written by a longtime security professional and CEO of Secure Planet, LLC, this step-by-step guide to the â€œgameâ€ of penetration hacking features hands-on examples and helpful advice from the top of the field.\r\n\r\nThrough a series of football-style â€œplays,â€ this straightforward guide gets to the root of many of the roadblocks people may face while penetration testingâ€”including attacking different types of networks, pivoting through security controls, privilege escalation, and evading antivirus software.\r\n\r\nFrom â€œPregameâ€ research to â€œThe Driveâ€ and â€œThe Lateral Pass,â€ the practical plays listed can be read in order or referenced as needed. Either way, the valuable advice within will put you in the mindset of a penetration tester of a Fortune 500 company, regardless of your career or level of experience.\r\n\r\nThis second version of The Hacker Playbook takes all the best &quot;plays&quot; from the original book and incorporates the latest attacks, tools, and lessons learned. Double the content compared to its predecessor, this guide further outlines building a lab, walks through test cases for attacks, and provides more customized code.\r\n\r\nWhether youâ€™re downing energy drinks while desperately looking for an exploit, or preparing for an exciting new job in IT security, this guide is an essential part of any ethical hackerâ€™s libraryâ€”so thereâ€™s no reason not to get in the game","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f27b014e42c85a7c8c831358c4d117ff6ca0c190","amp;dn":"The+Hacker+Playbook+2%3A+Practical+Guide+To+Penetration+Testng.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f27b014e42c85a7c8c831358c4d117ff6ca0c190","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,123,1,78,66,200,90,124,140,131,19,88,196,209,23,255,108,160,193,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
