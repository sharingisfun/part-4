Having interviewed McCartney many times before,I know he offers great insight into that process. As the most successful songwriter of all time, and the man behind some of my favourite music, I couldnÂ’t ask for a better guest Â– itÂ’s going to be a very special session.Â”\r\n\r\nThe legendary songwriter popped past the BBC's Maida Vale's studios on May 11th, joined by an extremely small audience.\r\n\r\nLucky competition winners were able to watch Paul McCartney wax lyrical, joined by the likes of Paul Weller, Noel Gallagher, \r\nand Brad Pitt Â– who came straight off set to watch the show being filmed.\r\n\r\nIt's a remarkably honest interview. Looking back on his lengthy career Paul McCartney reflected on some fond, \r\nand not so fond, memories, including stints working with George Martin, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson and, of course, John Lennon. \r\n\r\n \r\nTechnical Info\r\nVideo MPEG-2\r\nVideo Bitrate 9029 kbp/s\r\nAudio AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate 384 kbp/s\r\nPAL Format 720x576\r\nScreensize 4:3 (16:9 Anamorphic)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bcde3656e3346c60867908d4f9dd3182a911081","amp;dn":"Paul+McCartney+2016-05-24+BBC+Mastertapes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bcde3656e3346c60867908d4f9dd3182a911081","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,205,227,101,110,51,70,198,8,103,144,141,79,157,211,24,42,145,16,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
