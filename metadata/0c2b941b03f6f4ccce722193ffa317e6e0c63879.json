A man had died of bubonic plague, one of the world's deadliest diseases. But how could that be possible? \r\n\r\nBubonic Panic tells the true story of America's first plague epidemic-the public health doctors who desperately fought to end it, the political leaders who tried to keep it hidden, and the brave scientists who uncovered the plague's secrets. \r\n\r\nOnce again, acclaimed author and scientific expert Gail Jarrow brings the history of a medical mystery to life in vivid and exciting detail for young readers. This title includes photographs and drawings, a glossary, a timeline, further resources, an author's note, and source notes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c2b941b03f6f4ccce722193ffa317e6e0c63879","amp;dn":"Bubonic+Panic+-+When+Plague+Invaded+America+%282016%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c2b941b03f6f4ccce722193ffa317e6e0c63879","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,43,148,27,3,246,244,204,206,114,33,147,255,163,23,230,224,198,56,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
