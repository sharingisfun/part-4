This means that there is a very marginal loss of quality with respect to the original DVD, only perceptible if you do a careful frame by frame inspection. To the naked eye there is no loss. What is clear is the reduction in size which is around 1/4th or the original.\n\nThe guaranteed delivery is original English audio (AC3) + English subs + Spanish subs. However, around 20 of the films also contain Spanish audio (re-encoded to mp4/AAC-HEv2 48kbps) and French subs (roughly 22 of the 24 films contain it).\n \nYou can see the details of each film in the MediaInfo.txt file included.\n\nIf you can please post this torrent on other sites.\n\nEnjoy, share, and be patient during original release 10/10.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:037d35d5d02ed019c4df7559734ca8049e361c82","amp;dn":"Woody+Allen+Mega+Collection+%281971-2002%29+24+Films+x264-AC3+Subs-E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"037d35d5d02ed019c4df7559734ca8049e361c82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,125,53,213,208,46,208,25,196,223,117,89,115,76,168,4,158,54,28,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
