Although the group's music has roots from bluegrass, the trio describes itself as &quot;progressive acoustic&quot;.[1] Nickel Creek consisted of three permanent members: Chris Thile (mandolin), Sara Watkins (fiddle), and her brother Sean Watkins (guitar). The trio has always recorded and toured with a bass player, but no bass player has ever been an official member of the band. Chris's father Scott Thile played bass with the group until 2000, followed by Byron House, and Derek Jones. Mark Schatz has played bass regularly with the group since 2003.[2][3] In interviews, the band has stressed that they are not a bluegrass band, but a band that &quot;incorporates bluegrass into [its] music&quot;.[4] Nickel Creek has covered songs by Weezer, Radiohead, Pavement, Coldplay, Elliott Smith, Bob Dylan, The White Stripes, the Jackson Five and Britney Spears.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNickel Creek 2000\n\n\nNickel Creek (2000) is an eponymous album by the acoustic/&quot;newgrass&quot; trio known as Nickel Creek. Although the group had released two albums prior to this, they are not produced anymore and the band's style was redefined before the release of Nickel Creek; therefore this album is widely regarded as their debut album. It was released by Sugar Hill Records, and produced by country star Alison Krauss.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1\t&quot;Ode to a Butterfly&quot;\n2\t&quot;The Lighthouse's Tale&quot;\n3\t&quot;Out of the Woods&quot;\n4\t&quot;House of Tom Bombadil&quot;\n5\t&quot;Reasons Why&quot;\n6\t&quot;When You Come Back Down&quot;\n7\t&quot;Sweet Afton&quot;\n8\t&quot;Cuckoo's Nest&quot;\n9\t&quot;The Hand Song&quot;\n10\t&quot;Robin and Marian&quot;\n11\t&quot;The Fox&quot;\n12\t&quot;Pastures New&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Side 2002\n\n\n\nThis Side is the Grammy-winning fourth album by the band Nickel Creek, released in the summer of 2002. It gained some notoriety in indie rock circles due to the group's recording of a Pavement song, Spit on a Stranger. Alison Krauss acted as a producer for the album.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Smoothie Song&quot; (instrumental) (Chris Thile) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20\n2.\t&quot;Spit on a Stranger&quot; (Stephen Malkmus) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“- 2:34\n3.\t&quot;Speak&quot; (Sean Watkins) -ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01\n4.\t&quot;Hanging by a Thread&quot; (Gordon Kennedy, Wayne Kirkpatrick) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“- 4:06\n5.\t&quot;I Should've Known Better&quot; (Carrie Newcomer) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“- 4:27\n6.\t&quot;This Side&quot; (Watkins) -ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n7.\t&quot;Green and Gray&quot; (Thile) -ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36\n8.\t&quot;Seven Wonders&quot; (Watkins, David Puckett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“- 4:10\n9.\t&quot;House Carpenter&quot; (Traditional; version of &quot;The Daemon Lover&quot;) -ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:30\n10.\t&quot;Beauty and the Mess&quot; (Thile, Luke Bulla) -ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:52\n11.\t&quot;Sabra Girl&quot; (Andy Irvine) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“- 4:04\n12.\t&quot;Young&quot; (Thile) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“- 3:29\n13.\t&quot;Brand New Sidewalk&quot; (Thile) -ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Should The Fire Die 2005\n\n\n\nWhy Should The Fire Die? is the third major album release and fifth album overall by progressive acoustic trio Nickel Creek.
