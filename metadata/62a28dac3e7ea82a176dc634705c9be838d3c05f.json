That led Ma to ask six directors and several other artists from different disciplines to collaborate with him on a series of short films, part documentary, part performance, each one based on one of the suites. The resulting mini-series, titled Inspired by Bach, was shown on television in Canada, the U.S., Europe, and at various film festivals. Each of the suites in this recording, however, isn't necessarily the exact soundtrack for the film it goes with, but it was what the other artists involved in the project used as their inspiration. \n\n\nRipped to .FLAC (level 8) using dBpoweramp in Secure Mode","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62a28dac3e7ea82a176dc634705c9be838d3c05f","amp;dn":"YO-YO+MA+Cello+Suites+inspired+by+Bach+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62a28dac3e7ea82a176dc634705c9be838d3c05f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,162,141,172,62,126,168,42,23,109,198,52,112,92,155,232,56,211,192,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
