Drawing from a surprising variety of public and academic genres, including creative nonfiction, academic articles, blogs, Twitter posts, brochures, flyers, reviews, online multimodal texts, and public service ads, each chapter takes up a question at the heart of daily life and looks closely at ideas and genres that shape our responses to it. An in-depth introduction,along with carefully scaffolded questions and writing assignments, support students as they analyze writersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ choices and put their understanding of genre to work in their own writing Ã¢â‚¬â€ for real audiences and with real purpose. The print text is now integrated with e-Pages for Real Questions, designed to take advantage of what the Web can do.\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f8f5dc45d683bb0726b392c9cbae6e8fedc9bd6","amp;dn":"Real+Questions%3A+Reading+and+Writing+Genres+-+Kathryn+Evans+-+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f8f5dc45d683bb0726b392c9cbae6e8fedc9bd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,143,93,196,93,104,59,176,114,107,57,44,156,186,230,232,254,220,155,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
