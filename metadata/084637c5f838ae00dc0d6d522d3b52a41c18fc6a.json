If you don't want to start such a big download, you can choose only 1 or 2 of the files at a time by unchecking the appropriate boxes when the torrent is opened.)\n\nAll the old Airport films have vanished from the PirateBay! Even if they are old and camp and passÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© compared to modern action films, they are still funny to watch -- especially for us who are interested in airplane history. I am old enough to remember seeing them all in the cinema theatres when they were new, and there was nothing camp about them then. But today, it feels kind of embarassing to have PAID to watch old stars like George Kennedy.\n\nAlas, the production company has not bothered to transfer the cinema surround sound to all the DVDs, so several still have only Dolby Mono.\n\nI found this torrent from Demonoid with all of the films, here is a survey:\n\nAirport (1970)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065377/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065377/&lt;/a&gt;\n&quot;The one with the little old lady and the bomb&quot;, mostly 707s, DC-8s and a few DC-9s. Boeing 707 was the biggest airplane available when the film was shot, the 'Jumbo' 747 had its first scheduled flight in January 1970 and just missed being cast for the film.\nWidescreen, STEREO (although a little old and rusty)\n\nAirport '75 (1974) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071110/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071110/&lt;/a&gt;\n&quot;The one with Charlton Heston and the singing nun&quot; could finally show a 'Jumbo' 747 colliding with a smaller plane. For some strange reason, this movie was produced with mono sound.\nWidescreen, Dolby mono. Even the full DVD from cdon dot com has mono.\n\nAirport '77 (1977)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075648/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075648/&lt;/a&gt;\n&quot;The one with Jack Lemmon&quot; - A fancy private 747 crashes in the Bermuda triangle, where the rest of the film takes place in underwater sets. The furniture wasn't even bolted to the floor! I think Lemmon was completely miscast as an action hero. Besides, filthy rich people stowing all their treasures on earth into an airplane have really asked for it!\nWidescreen, Dolby mono.\n\nAirport '79 - the Concorde (1979) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078740/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078740/&lt;/a&gt;\nThe plot for this film was so silly that it's unintentionally funny. But it gives a rare opportunity to really see this advanced supersonic plane up close, also from the inside. All the more valuable now that the remaining planes have bee retired to museum pieces. French ladykiller Alain Delon speaks English in this film.\nWidescreen, Dolby mono.\n\nMore details on the production and sound quality: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/review/product/B0000WN05A?filterBy=addFiveStar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/review/product/B0000WN05A?filterBy=addFiveStar&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Be prepared for a lesson in patience and a slow download over several days. I cannot seed this elephant myself. The seeding is uneven and slow because so many users only download one or two of the films.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:084637c5f838ae00dc0d6d522d3b52a41c18fc6a","amp;dn":"Airport+%281970%29+Airport+75+Airport+77+Airport+79+%28DVDrip%2CENG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"084637c5f838ae00dc0d6d522d3b52a41c18fc6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,70,55,197,248,56,174,0,220,13,109,82,45,59,82,164,28,24,252,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
