But for Natalee Murray, things have just gotten way more difficult. Bored with life, she can't wait to graduate high school and get out of town, especially considering the famous band members from AD2 suddenly start attending her school, making her once boring life, absolutely insane.\n\nIt starts with a pen. A single brush of fingers, and she is captivated.\n\nBut Alec and Demetri have a dark secret, one that could shatter their reputations and Natalee's heart. What do you do when one guy paints your life with color while the other infuses your soul with passion? How do you choose when your heart is divided?\n\n*This is a New Adult/Mature YA.

SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beautiful, smart, but above all else, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s damaged. And one thing Demetri has learned is two broken hearts donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t equal a whole.\nIn the end, he has to decide if he can rise above the life heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s created in learning from his past mistakes, or fall into the darkness of his choices. \n\nShatter (The Seaside #3) by Rachel Van Dyken (May 19th 2013) \n\nSometimes the only way to heal... is to shatter.\n\nRock star Alec Daniels has it all.

Now he faces the toughest decision of his life: \nDeal with his mistake like a man, or dive back into the dark hole of depression, drugs, and denial that have been his comfort for so long.\nOne wrong move could destroy everything. His girlfriend, his family, and his future. \n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37ab08c42454f6a601f357c2157013abe40beb1a","amp;dn":"The+Seaside+Series+%281-3%29+by+Rachel+van+Dyken+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37ab08c42454f6a601f357c2157013abe40beb1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,171,8,196,36,84,246,166,1,243,87,194,21,112,19,171,228,11,235,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
