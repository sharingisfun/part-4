This is taken from the cd box set released in 1999. \nStill, you won't miss much. \n\n----\nAbout the dramatization:\n\nIn my opinion, this is vastly superior to the movie, which had a horrid script making a mockery of Tolkiens story and language. Apart from the many omitted elements (which I can understand were necessary in the interest of providing a good arrative), there were some ridiculous twists which changed Tolkiens story completely. Jackson obviously did not care much for keeping Tolkiens story intact and whole. Though of course the eyecandy was incredible.\n\nAbout the file quality:\n\nWhether I've made the right encoding choice is of course a matter of debate, but the package can now be burned to a CD-R and transferred rather quickly (as opposed to FLAC for instance, which would've yielded a whopping 6 or 7 GB's to download). The quality is sufficient to play it on a portable mp3 player. Since it's mostly speech, you could even consider burning it to a cd (though listening on a hi-fi audio set would reveal many imperfections and artefacts of course). \n\n\n--Curunir","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8967a25e10079c04b9c7704e3c9ae93e274f831","amp;dn":"BBC+Radio+Dramatization+of+the+Lord+of+the+Rings+%5B1981%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8967a25e10079c04b9c7704e3c9ae93e274f831","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,150,122,37,225,0,121,192,75,156,119,4,227,201,174,147,226,116,248,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
