Fiber optics is now the backbone of the internet and long-distance telecommunication. Without it we would not enjoy the benefits of high-speed internet, or low-rate international telephone calls.\n\nThis book introduces the basic concepts of fiber-optic communication in a pedagogical way. The important mathematical results are derived by first principles rather than citing research articles. In addition, physical interpretations and real-world analogies are provided to help students grasp the fundamental concepts.\n\nKey Features:\n\nLucid explanation of key topics such as fibers, lasers, and photodetectors.\nIncludes recent developments such as coherent communication and digital signal processing.\nComprehensive treatment of fiber nonlinear transmission.\nWorked examples, exercises, and answers.\nAccompanying website with PowerPoint slides and numerical experiments in MATLAB.\n\nIntended primarily for senior undergraduates and graduates studying fiber-optic communications, the book is also suitable as a professional resource for researchers working in the field of fiber-optic communications.\nFrom the Back Cover\n\nFiber-optic communication systems have advanced dramatically over the last four decades, since the era of copper cables, resulting in low-cost and high-bandwidth transmission.
