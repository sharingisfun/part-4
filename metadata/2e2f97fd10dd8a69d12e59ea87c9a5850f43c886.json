In The Future of Finance he uses an insiderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perspective to full effect, pulling together the views of many practitioners to illuminate both the roots of the 2008 global crisis and private equityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s potential role in rebuilding our financial system. SchwartzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fast-paced, conversational style makes for a welcome contrast to dry economic analysisÃ¢â‚¬â€well worth reading for both business leaders and students of finance.\nDan Carroll\nManaging Partner, TPG\nDan SchwartzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Future of Finance offers an insightful and compelling window into the world of private equity and venture capital.

Replete with in-depth perspectives of dozens of the most senior global venture capital and private equity leaders and numerous case study examples, this gem artfully explains the dramatic changes happening in these vital industries and how government leaders, policy makers, entrepreneurs and investors must adapt for continuing success in the second decade of the 21st century.\nDixon R. Doll\nCofounder and General Partner, DCM\nChairman, U.S. National Venture Capital Assoc. (2008-09)\n\nFrom cottage industry to multi-billion asset class, Asian private equity has transformed the regionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s financial and corporate landscape in two short decades. Dan Schwartz was present at the beginning of this fascinating era as iconic spokesman and entrepreneurial founder of AVCJ. His contribution as chief convener to the industry helped shape an asset class. The Future of Finance is forward-looking while drawing upon the rich past of an industryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s development amid volatile cycles, financial crises, pandemics, capital excess, capital drought and Darwinian struggles. Many of the prime movers, who paved the way to the future, have shared privileged views with Dan over the years and now on these insightful pages.\nPhilip Bilden\nManaging Director, HarbourVest Partners (Asia)\nDan SchwartzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extensive and experienced network has enabled him to tap the key issues and insights of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading private equity and venture capital practitioners around the world. This enlivens DanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stroll through Europe, North America and Asia as he examines the development of these private capital marketsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and these insights shape the prism through which he views a future for private equity in the coming decades.\nBill Ferris\nExecutive Chairman, Champ Private Equity\nDan Schwartz is the person best placed to write about the history of the private equity industry in AsiaÃ¢â‚¬â€he was there right from the beginning. In nearly two decades, he has been a keen observer of the industryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s developments and market trends. He was the cheerleader when the industry was down and he has been a friend to most of the leading practitioners, a position that provides him with unique insights into the actual workings of the industry as described in the book. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“New Corporate TheoryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ introduced in the last section of the book is an interesting thesis. If it comes to fruition, it will transform the shareholder-driven corporate governance model as we know it today.\nTang Kok Yew\nChairman and Managing Partner, Affinity Equity Partners (HK)\n\n\nTable of Contents\nForeword (David Rubenstein).\nAcknowledgments.\n\nCHAPTER 1 Tomorrow Will Be Different than Today.\n\nCHAPTER 2 Private Equity and Venture Capital: A Primer.\n\nCHAPTER 3 2009: A Very Challenging Year.\n\nCHAPTER 4 2010: Private Equity and Venture League Tables and Niches.\n\nCHAPTER 5 Private Equity and Venture Capital in Markets Around the World.\n\nCHAPTER 6 Industry Issues.\n\nCHAPTER 7 The Next Decade: A Future Scape.\n\nCHAPTER 8 Toward a New &quot;Corporate Norm&quot;.\n\nNotes.\n\nThe Class of 2010 (People Interviewed in the Book).\n\nIndex.\n\n\nAuthor Information\nDan began his career in the financial world in Houston and New York.
