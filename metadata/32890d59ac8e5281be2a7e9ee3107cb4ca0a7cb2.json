As Don makes the plays in the boardroom and the bedroom, he struggles to stay a step ahead of the rapidly changing times and the young executives nipping at his heels. The series also depicts authentically the roles of men and women in this era while exploring the true human nature beneath the guise of 1960s traditional family values. \n\n** Season One **  \n\nEpisode 1: Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\nEpisode 2: Ladies Room\nEpisode 3: Marriage of Figaro\nEpisode 4: New Amsterdam\nEpisode 5: 5G\nEpisode 6: Babylon\nEpisode 7: Red in the Face\nEpisode 8: The Hobo Code\nEpisode 9: Shoot\nEpisode 10: Long Weekend\nEpisode 11: Indian Summer\nEpisode 12: Nixon Vs.
