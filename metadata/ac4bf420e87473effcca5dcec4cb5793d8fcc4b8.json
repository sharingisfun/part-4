This non-linear autobiographical film is considered by many Russian-speakers to be his best film and is his most personal meditation on time, history and the Russian countryside. In a series of episodes and images, he captures the mood and feeling of the period just before, during and after the war. Lyrical reminiscences of his mother and of his father's poetry figure large in the film, along with extraordinary images of nature. Combining black-and-white and color work, with some unusual documentary footage, this highly regarded movie is structured with the logic of a dream.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Zerkalo.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.56 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 41mn\n      Overall bit rate : 2 194 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 41mn\n      Bit rate : 1 737 Kbps\n      Width : 704 pixels\n      Height : 512 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.375\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.193\n      Stream size : 1.24 GiB (79%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 41mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 448 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 6 channels\n      Channel positions : Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 326 MiB (20%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072443/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072443/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRussian audio; Subpack (idx/sub) with the following languages: English, Russian, Deutsch, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Swedish, Arabic, Hebrew, Mandarin, Japanese\n\nMy rip of the Artificial Eye DVD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac4bf420e87473effcca5dcec4cb5793d8fcc4b8","amp;dn":"Andrei+Tarkovsky+-+Zerkalo+%281975%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac4bf420e87473effcca5dcec4cb5793d8fcc4b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,75,244,32,232,116,115,239,252,202,93,206,196,203,87,147,216,252,196,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
