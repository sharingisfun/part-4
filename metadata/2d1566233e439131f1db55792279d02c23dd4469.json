In fact, they actually exist in a semicrystalline state where the crystals are embedded in an amorphous phase to create a highly interconnected network. Presenting an in-depth and current overview of polymer crystals, &quot;Crystals and Crystallinity in Polymers&quot; provides researchers, engineers, and graduate students with guidelines to help select the proper crystallization method, evaluate polymer crystallization data, determine which methods to utilize for particular cases, and understand the different analytical techniques utilized","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d1566233e439131f1db55792279d02c23dd4469","amp;dn":"Crystals+and+Crystallinity+in+Polymers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d1566233e439131f1db55792279d02c23dd4469","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,21,102,35,62,67,145,49,241,219,85,121,34,121,208,44,35,221,68,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
