By exploring the subject through its 50 key insights - from the simple (the number one) and the subtle (the invention of zero) to the sophisticated (proving Fermat's last theorem) - this book shows how mathematics has changed the way we look at the world around us.\n\nGenre: General, Mathematics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f698c7cd399261a4bf3d97df43759586e502c78","amp;dn":"50+Mathematical+Ideas+You+Really+Need+to+Know+by+Tony+Crilly","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f698c7cd399261a4bf3d97df43759586e502c78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,105,140,124,211,153,38,26,75,243,217,125,244,55,89,88,110,80,44,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
