It is a mini-encyclopedia of the numerous un-humanitarian acts perpetrated by the United States since the end of the Second World War.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Rogue State forcibly reminds us of Vice President AgnewÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s immortal line: Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe United States, for all its faults, is still the greatest nation in the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Gore Vidal, author, The Decline and Fall of the American Empire\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Critics will call this a one-sided book. But it is an invaluable corrective to the establishment portrait of America as the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest force for peace. Even confirmed opponents of U.S. interventionism can find much in this important book that will both educate and shock them.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Peter Dale Scott, former Professor at UC Berkeley, poet, and author, Deep Politics and The Death of JFK\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Bill Blum came by his title easily. He simply tested America by the same standards we use to judge other countries. The result is a bill of wrongs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an especially well-documented encyclopedia of malfeasance, mendacity and mayhem that has been hypocritically carried out in the name of democracy by those whose only true love was power.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sam Smith, Editor, The Progressive Review, Washington, DC\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Bravo Blum! A vivid, well-aimed critique of the evils of US global interventionism, a superb antidote to officialdomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lies and propaganda.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Michael Parenti, author of History as Mystery and To Kill a Nation: The Attack on Yugoslavia\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d8ece8a8aa43fe0296f3df0c185c1b71f173466","amp;dn":"Rogue+State+++++A+Guide+to+the+World%26rsquo%3Bs+Only+Superpower","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d8ece8a8aa43fe0296f3df0c185c1b71f173466","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,142,206,138,138,164,63,224,41,111,61,240,193,133,193,183,31,23,52,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
