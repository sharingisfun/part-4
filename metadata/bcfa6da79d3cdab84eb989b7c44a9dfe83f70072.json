The challenge is motivating yourself to take them on a consistent basis... blasting right through your fears, even eliminating them, so you can make those big dreams come true. Knowledge alone rarely translates into the action habits that will transform your life.\n\nIf you're to enjoy the things that winners in life do, you must share their beliefs and attitudes, which create the emotions that drive them.\nIf you own some, or even many, self-help information products that didn't stop your panic and anxiety, and didn't help drive you into taking the appropriate actions, then Dr. Teri Mahaney's proven Think Right Now Accelerated Success Conditioning Software For WindowsÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® may just become your favorite &quot;secret weapon&quot; in your quest for a more fulfilled life.\n\nHow can it accelerate change and help you do what you want to do without fear and anxiety?\n\nThink Right Now for Windows software re-patterns your thoughts so you really truly believe, from deep inside yourself, that you'll absolutely succeed, no matter what your goal is...\n\nAnd you'll be able to take the appropriate actions without drama or fear.\n\nIt helps you to stop re-running all your past mistakes in your mind and replace those scripts with mental pictures (instructions) of you succeeding. This subtle yet profound shift in your mental functioning will blow people away when they see your new found confidence and strength of mind.\n\nConfidence and expectations of achievement will be high all the time, no matter what you're tackling.\nSo Effective We Guarantee It\n \nYou are what you think about...\n\nAnd Dr. Mahaney has helped develop a software program so effective at changing your core beliefs about your own abilities, that you'll literally become someone different.Do you want to eat right but haven't ever been able to stay on a healthy regimen? Need to exercise but can't stay motivated?\n\nÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â» What about relationships? Can't seem to make them work?\n\nÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Have you got some bad habits that you just can't quit?\n\nÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Are you a student or going through training at work? Does the flood of information get overwhelming?\n\nÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Do business and money decisions seem to be more and more difficult in this intense economic environment?\n\nTo enjoy the same daily successes that life's winners achieve, you need to be conditioned to unconsciously, automatically think similar thoughts...\n\n...Because a thought comes before every action.Software For Your Mental Computer\n \nJust by sitting at your computer, like you do now, the Think Right Now Suite For Windows software can literally &quot;install&quot; in you the same moment by moment thoughts and attitudes about smoking as a non-smoker, about food and exercise as a slim, healthy person and about failure and money as the ultra successful...\n\n...plus a whole lot more.\n\nWhen you begin to think, believe and feel like a top performer in whatever area of life you want to change, then you will naturally take the same actions as those people... and your problem will vanish.\n\nWhenever your old problem or temptation comes up, you'll tell yourself to do the same things world-class performers tell themselves to do.\n\nAnd you'll do it... like they do. Naturally and easily.\n\nNow, I know you're probably a little skeptical. And that's natural. But let me give you a few reasons why you should believe it.\n\nTwo Reasons To Take This Seriously\n \n#1: Dr. Teri Mahaney, the author of Change Your Mind - A step-by-step guide to re-pattern your powerful subconscious mind, is one of the geniuses behind this incredible visual software program.\n \nA former college professor and dean, Dr. Mahaney's star is glowing brightly in the personal development community. Recently, she spent a week with peak performance consultant TonyxRobbins, training dozens of his multi-gazillionaire clients, and even Tony himself, in re-patterning their limiting beliefs and unconscious blocks.\n\nThese days Dr. Mahaney is in high demand, doing training seminars and interviews three and a half weeks out of every month, training large groups in some of the most cutting edge mind technologies.\n\n#2: Subliminal suggestion works... \n          ...IF the information reaches your senses.\n\nNow before you bring up the box of subliminal tapes you have in the basement that never did a thing for you, IÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll let you in on a secretÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦\nIÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ve got a few boxes of them.\n\nToward the end of two decades of failure and indifference, back in the mid 1980ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s I became interested in breaking my cycle of failure. So I bought a number of subliminal audio tapes.\n\nAfter listening to them day and night for two years, my relationships were still horrible, I was totally miserable and my sales income was non-existent... so I was forced to live in my van.\n\nAnd I found out my experience wasn't unique.\n\nNumerous recent studies have been done and they all conclude the same thingÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦\n\n...that commercial subliminal audio tapes cannot deliver a verbal message loud enough (underneath music, waves or white noise) to make the eardrums vibrate. And if your ear drums don't vibrate from the sound of the words, all you're doing is listening to music or ocean waves. It might sound nice, but it's doing nothing to help you in the pursuit of your goals.But after I began using the accelerated learning techniques that Think Right Now For Windows is based on, my career began to skyrocket, and every other area of my life started to change for the better, too.\n\nWithin two years I became the top earning sales executive in the world in the hearing testing and instrumentation field.\n\nWithin a few more years, I had shattered industry sales records in two other completely separate industries. I had literally morphed into a completely different person from the one I was for over twenty four years... starting from below zero to being on top in a remarkably short period of time.\nThe Eyes Have It\n \nVisual subliminal self-instructions like those used in the Think Right Now Suite For Windows (Vista, XP, 2000, Me, NT4+, 98, 95), have decades of clinical and university research showing that they can and do register with your eyes and do affect beliefs, attitudes and behaviors.\nour Life Is A Mirror Of Your Thoughts\n \nLike it or not, the words we say to ourselves and what we focus on about life, about ourselves, and about others shape our beliefs, attitudes and feelings. Think of your thoughts as the keyboard... the data entry to your mind (Your mental computer).\n\nWhen you center your attention (the data input) on...\n\n--how you're not good enough\n\n--what other people have done to you\n\n-- how unfair life is\n\n--worrying about the worst possible outcome...\n\n... at the direction of your thoughts, chemicals that act like powerful depressants surge through your body, causing you to become even more frightened, depressed and worried as the moments tick by.\nWhenever these kinds of thoughts are allowed to &quot;pop in&quot;, you simply cannot perform at peak levels in any area of your life. If it's allowed to go on habitually, consistently positive outcomes become impossible. Your incredible potential, along with your happiness, can turn non-existent.\n\n \nIt's very common...\n \nIt's this single mental habit... the focusing of too much attention on what is or might be wrong, that's destroyed more dreams and bright futures of more people, living and dead, than all other habits combined.\n\nThe beliefs and attitudes that allow these vicious thought habits to flourish develop over time, and can come from many sources including...\n\n-- Criticism or any particularly painful past event(s)\n\n-- Your body's appearance or physical limitations\n\n...They can feed off one another, spinning you out of control until anxiety and self consciousness literally take over your whole being.\nChange Thoughts, Actions Will Follow...\n \nOur inner thoughts and feelings, if allowed to change, can transform a lifelong loser into a champion in every sense of the word.\n\nThink Right Now For Windows helps you...\n\nÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Focus on what's good in your life, instead of what's wrong\n\nÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Blast through your doubts to adopt habitual &quot;I Can&quot; beliefs which will steer your career and your relationships where you want them to go.\n\nÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Enjoy your hours and days, making life a fun, rewarding adventure, just like people who seem to enjoy life so naturally...\n\nThink Right Now can help you effortlessly conquer your fears, and succeed every day even if you've failed repeatedly.\nWhat Is Think Right Now! For Windows?\n \nThink Right Now Accelerated Success Software For Windows is 33 programs in 1, which can run on any Vista, XP, 2000, Me, NT4+, 98 or 95 Windows based PC.\nIt has just two main functions...\n\nThe software's primary function is that it briefly flashes, on your computer screen, 1,000's of visible statements of affirmation. It does this in the background while you work in any Windows based program, even while you're on the Internet.\n\nEvery time you turn on your computer it's with you, no matter what you're doing.\n\nWith just a one-time click of your mouse, you can set the flashing affirmations to be on screen from as little as 1/1000 second to up to a 1/2 second each. That's 500 milliseconds... ...50 times longer than in the study that you read about earlier.\n\nSo in case you had any lingering doubts, your mind will most certainly register these statements. You can also set it to have as little as one second in between messages.\n\nJust in case you don't see small print so well any more, you can set the text to be as small as 6 point and up to 56 point. On monitors that are set at 600 X 800 resolution, 56 point text is nearly an inch tall.\n\n \n33 Powerful Change Programs In 1...\n \n...And you get them all.\nPlus, you're not restricted to using only a single category at a time. If you want, you can choose multiple categories simultaneously. \nSo let's say you want to lose about 50 pounds...\n\nAll you do is click the Eating Well file, the Exercising Regularly file, and support them with some Confidence and Self Esteem files and you're on your way. A couple mouse clicks and you're done. Then, every single time you turn your computer on, Think Right Now is with youThe Music Helps Develops Super Memory\n\nThe world's most revered accelerated learning researcher, Dr. Georgi Lozanov first discovered that when special &quot;mathematical&quot; slow Baroque music was played he could induce in students a state of alert relaxation where symptoms of stress evaporated and rapid memorization occurred.\n\nToday, Dr. Lozanov's methods are the foundation for accelerated language learning programs, corporate training courses and continuing University research &amp; classes in dozens of countries around the world... \n \nWhat happens is this...\n \nAs you're working or playing on your PC, your pulse will begin to automatically synchronize with the music (it only has to be loud enough for your ears to register the rhythm) and then...\nAn increasing number of your brain cells will begin to vibrate at a slower 8-12 cycles per second rate. Typical waking (beta) rate for most people is 13-27 cycles (pulses) per second. This slower brain wave rhythm is known as the Alpha brainwave state.\n\nResearch on people with high IQ's indicates that more areas of their brains vibrate all the time at this slower 8-12 cps alpha level than those with average and low IQÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s.\nBy using Think Right Now For Windows, you can stay in sync with this special rhythm for hours every day.\nAt very least you'll remember everything you're doing on your PC better... including all those confidence and performance boosting affirmations that Think Right Now is flooding your mind with. So all your new affirmations (beliefs) will be more firmly embedded in your mind and heart.\n\nHere's a few examples of how, moment by moment, we affirm our old established beliefs and affirm new ones all day long:\nNegative Affirmations: Language of Failures\n\nIÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½m not ready for this\nThereÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s no way IÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll get that done on time\nI need a cigarette\nIÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll never lose this weight\nShe won't go out with me\nEvery single time we think and say things like this we're affirming it, making it more true every time. We believe a little bit more every time. This is why long time habits are difficult to break.\n\nNeutral Affirmations: Simple Statements of Fact\n\nThat's a blue dress\nIt's 9:45 PM\nIÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½m a personnel manager\nThat tree is 30 feet tall\nPositive Affirmations: Language of The Successful\n\nThis is going to be easy\nI forgive you\nI feel great when IÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½m running\nI'll drop this last 20 pounds in a flash!\nIÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½m beating this cancer ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ I donÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t care what they say\nWhat a beautiful day!\nEvery time these kinds of thoughts are given to our subconscious mind through our conscious thoughts or our unconscious awareness, they become more true for us. We believe them more every single time we are exposed to them.\n\nSo, you see...\n\nYou are affirming your beliefs every minute of every day... simply by thinking.\n\nIf you change your affirmations (your thoughts), you change your life...\n\nHow Does It Motivate You?\n \nLet's back up for 3 seconds... \nWe've already established that your eyes do pick up the flashing affirmations, right? It's important that you understand that, so...\n \n \nYou are what you affirm. Your thoughts (affirmations) are your beliefs... \nIn the first person (I, me), Think Right Now will flash carefully designed emotionally charged self-instructions in the categories of your choice.\nIt's like you're doing the talking. \n-- You'll be telling yourself to release all the garbage that's held you back.\n-- You'll be encouraging yourself to enjoy the actions that will transport you to your goals.\n-- Your doubting self-talk will be smothered by encouragement.\n-- Gone will be the anxious, fear-filled self-talk of failure and lack, and in it's place will be hope and anticipation of success and freedom.\n-- Hundreds of thousands of times, through the visual affirmations quickly flashing on your screen, you'll be pushing, encouraging and cheering yourself on.\n-- Effortlessly, you'll be teaching yourself that your limitations are tiny and your strengths are great.\n-- You'll be convincing yourself that your past problems and mistakes don't matter anymore, that you should release them and focus on feeling great... right now. \n-- You'll be telling yourself that life is awesome, and today's your day...\nAnd after seeing these emotion-packed, new, success affirming statements for weeks and months every time you're at the computer, you'll be the best that you that you can be!\n\n...And happy to be it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTorrent reuploaded by blumppin12\nAll credits goes to the original uploader","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcfa6da79d3cdab84eb989b7c44a9dfe83f70072","amp;dn":"Think+Right+Now+subliminal+software","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcfa6da79d3cdab84eb989b7c44a9dfe83f70072","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,250,109,167,157,60,218,184,78,185,137,183,196,74,157,254,131,247,0,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
