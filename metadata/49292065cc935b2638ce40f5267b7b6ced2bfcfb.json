It told the story of a history teacher who went missing one winter after his brief affair with a stunning pupil. Upon publication, M.â€™s novel was a bestseller, one that marked his international breakthrough.\r\nThat was years ago, and now M.â€™s career is almost over as he fades increasingly into obscurity. But not when it comes to his bizarre, seemingly timid neighbor who keeps a close eye on him. Why?\r\nFrom various perspectives, Herman Koch tells the dark tale of a writer in decline, a teenage couple in love, a missing teacher, and a single book that entwines all of their fates. Thanks to Mâ€™s novel, supposedly a work of fiction, everyone seems to be linked forever, until something unexpected spins the â€œstoryâ€ off its rails.\r\nWith racing tension, sardonic wit, and a world-renowned sharp eye for human failings, Herman Koch once again spares nothing and no one in his gripping new novel, a barbed tour de force suspending readers in the mysterious literary gray space between fact and fiction.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49292065cc935b2638ce40f5267b7b6ced2bfcfb","amp;dn":"Dear+Mr.+M+-+Herman+Koch-Sam+Garrett+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49292065cc935b2638ce40f5267b7b6ced2bfcfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,41,32,101,204,147,91,38,56,206,64,245,38,123,123,108,237,43,252,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
