There are also some new sketches, such as Four Yorkshiremen and One-Man Wrestling that are just as funny as the classics. Also, the Pythons get fine support from resident Python babe Carol Cleveland, and singer/musician Neil Innes. A hilarious, must-see film for Python fans","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdc61f5b5e739601f8436fdb443c407702d3dc27","amp;dn":"Monty.Python-Live+at+the+Hollywood+Bowl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdc61f5b5e739601f8436fdb443c407702d3dc27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,198,31,91,94,115,150,1,248,67,111,219,68,60,64,119,2,211,220,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
