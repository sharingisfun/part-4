Unlike the CD version of earlier singles compilation Substance, the B-sides are not included. While Substance aimed to showcase New Order's 12&quot; singles, Singles instead features mostly 7&quot; versions, some of these being quite rare as well as differing from album versions. Of special note are several early singles that have never appeared on CD in their original form: &quot;Ceremony&quot;, &quot;Everything's Gone Green&quot;, &quot;Temptation&quot;, and &quot;Confusion&quot;. One song, &quot;Turn&quot; was released on this album in a new form despite it not being a single. \nAmazon.com - The massively influential band New Order formed in Manchester, England, in 1980, rising from the ashes of U.K. post-punk pioneers Joy Division (after singer Ian Curtis took his own life). Guitarist Bernard Sumner assumed vocal duties for the new unit, and with drummer Stephen Morris, bassist Peter Hook, and keyboardist Gillian Gilbert, made music history. Successfully fusing new wave, electronica, synth-pop, and club music earlier than many bands now seen as contemporaries, their unique sound was as insightful and soulful as it was perfectly suited for the dance floor. From their earliest singles to their latest hits, this historic double-disc collection offers a career-spanning portrait of one of the most enduring and distinctive bands in modern rock.\n\nDisc 01\n\n[01] Ceremony\n[02] Procession\n[03] Everything's Gone Green\n[04] Temptation\n[05] Blue Monday\n[06] Confusion\n[07] Thieves Like Us\n[08] The Perfect Kiss\n[09] Sub-Culture\n[10] Shellshock\n[11] State Of The Nation\n[12] Bizarre Love Triangle\n[13] True Faith\n[14] 1963\n[15] Touched By The Hand Of God\n\nDisc 01 Play Time 01h:09m:36s\n\nDisc 02\n\n[01] Blue Monday ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“88\n[02] Fine Time\n[03] Round And Round\n[04] Run 2\n[05] World In Motion\n[06] Regret\n[07] Ruined In A Day\n[08] World Price Of Love\n[09] Spooky\n[10] Crystal\n[11] 60 Miles An Hour\n[12] Here To Stay\n[13] Krafty\n[14] Jetstream\n[15] Waiting For The Sirens' Call\n[16] Turn\n\nDisc 02 Play Time 01h:03m:39s\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 02h:13m:15s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 315mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v.9.0.0.70 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Electronica Dance\nRelease Date\t&gt; 03 October 2005\nRecord Company\t&gt; London Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt; http://www.neworderonline.com \n&gt;\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Order \n&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/n/neworder.html \n&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/neworder\n&gt;[Temptation]\n&gt;[Blue Monday ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“88]\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e378bba72757a3404b3238085894dae1cb814176","amp;dn":"%5B2005%5D+Singles+-+New+Order+315mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e378bba72757a3404b3238085894dae1cb814176","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,120,187,167,39,87,163,64,75,50,56,8,88,148,218,225,203,129,65,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
