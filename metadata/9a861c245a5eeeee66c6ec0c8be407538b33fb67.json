SCHOLTES  \n2002\nPDF \n433 pages \nISBN: 0071386882\n5.7 Mb\n\nThis is a very good book that I would recommend to any manager. I also think many employees would learn a lot from reading this book as well. The main reason is because the book talks very little in the way of leadership or inspiring your people. This is a book primarily focused on process and quality improvement, but learning about leadership and inspiring my employees is the reason I bought this book. \n\nTo me, the difference between a manager and a leader is that the successful manager gets his people to do what needs to be done. A successful leader gets his people to want to do what needs to be done. There was a lot more information on that topics in The Team Handbook, which Scholtes co-wrote.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a861c245a5eeeee66c6ec0c8be407538b33fb67","amp;dn":"The+Leader%5C%27s+Handbook%3A+Making+Things+Happen+Getting+Things+Done","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a861c245a5eeeee66c6ec0c8be407538b33fb67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,134,28,36,90,94,238,238,102,198,236,12,139,228,7,83,139,51,251,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
