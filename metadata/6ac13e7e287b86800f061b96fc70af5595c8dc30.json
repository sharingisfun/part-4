Pathos and dry humour (a Nail trademark)abound in a colourful and varied story which successfully mixes action, romance, mystery and music. The music, performed and mostly written by Nail, who also wrote the series, is excellent. It makes the story all the more believable - the soundtrack album really did make a singing star out of Jimmy Nail. North American viewers may find the Newcastle accents hard to follow.\n\n\nAll six episodes from the second series in which Jed finds that the good life is not all trouble free now that he is succesful.\n\n\nPlease note This is not my rip I got this elsewhere We must thank the original uploader = &quot;pgarbutt &quot; for making this series available i have looked at it and it is what it says its a TV VHS RIP so the quality is not like a dvd rip but it is still very watchable. Once again thanks to the original ripper.\n\n\nOriginal ripper notes\n\n\n\n\nCrocodile Shoes - Series 2\n==========================\n\n&quot;Raise your hands, jump for joy. Let's hear it for the country boy...&quot;\n\n6 Episodes.\n\n1. Country Boy\n2. Troubled Man\n3. Running Man\n4. Still I Dream\n5. Answered Prayers\n6. Boom\n\n\nTransferred from original VHS TV recordings off BBC1.\n\nPAL system format.\n\nArchived 28-29 September 2007.\n\n\nNotes\n=====\n\nFile format is of .DIVX format, but you can rename to .AVI if you prefer...still works fine if you do!\n\n\nTransfer History\n================\n\nVHS &gt; JVC S-VIDEO Recorder &gt; UMAX 8400 DVD Recorder &gt; DVD +R &gt; IFOEDIT 0.971 &gt; TMPGEnc DVD Author 3 &gt; DIVX (600MB)\n\nAnything higher rate than that and I don't think you'll spot the difference - 600MB per episode is just right anyways for approx 50 minutes of video, so the whole series fits onto a DVD-R quite easily. IFO Edit was used to clean the VOBs so that they'd go into TMPEGEnc.\n\nIf anyone has the sell-thru VHS of the series, I'll gladly transfer those instead!\n\nContact me through member: pgarbutt.\n\nPlease keep this NFO with the episodes so that people know how they were made and who done the work.\n\nJust remember - if this comes out on official DVD then buy it.\nThese DivX files are for archival purposes until that time, OK?!\nENJOY THIS RARELY-SEEN SERIES!\n\n\n\n\nI have also included the sound track from this series\n\n\nA big thank you to &quot; Ouzomenero &quot; for the OST\n\n\nJimmy Nail - Crocodile Shoes II - (1996)[EAC- MP3@320KBPS]\n\n\n\n\nJimmy Nail - Crocodile Shoes II\n\nTrack list\n\n\n01.
