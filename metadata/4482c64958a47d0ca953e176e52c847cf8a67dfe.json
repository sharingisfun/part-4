Given the motive, the band performs without a hitch. MilesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ own contributions come in his signature spurts and surges of snarling dissonant organ clusters, soaring clarion vortexes or terse vicious bursts of minimalist trumpet, whilst he conducts the whole affair with shamanistic egoless mastery. \n\nFor an off-night, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pretty mind-blowing stuff. There are loud peaks and quiet valleys on &quot;Dark Magus&quot;, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always something going on - an intense and driving set.\n\nQ Magazine named Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dark MagusÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ one of the 50 heaviest albums of all time, next to Slayer, Venom, Maiden, and of course Black Sabbath.\n\n\nMiles Davis\n\nDark Magus\n\nRecorded in 1974, released in 1977\n\n\n 2 CDs / 1997 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist / CD 1:\n\nMoja (Part 1)\n\nMoja (Part 2)\n\nWili (Part 1)\n\nWili (Part 2)\n\n\nTracklist / CD 2:\n\nTatu (Part 1)\n\nTatu (Part 2)\n\nNne (Part 1)\n\nNne (Part 2)\n\n\nRecorded on March 30, 1974, at Carnegie Hall, New York City\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\nMiles Davis Ã¢â‚¬â€œ trumpet, organ\n\nDave Liebman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ soprano saxophone, tenor saxophone\n\nAzar Lawrence Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tenor saxophone\n\nPete Cosey Ã¢â‚¬â€œ electric guitar\n\nReggie Lucas Ã¢â‚¬â€œ electric guitar\n\nDominique Gaumont Ã¢â‚¬â€œ electric guitar\n\nMichael Henderson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ electric bass\n\nAl Foster Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n\nJames Mtume Foreman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ percussion\n\n\nMiles Davis / Dark Magus / Recorded in 1974, released in 1977","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4482c64958a47d0ca953e176e52c847cf8a67dfe","amp;dn":"Miles+Davis+-+Dark+Magus%3A+Live+at+Carnegie+Hall+1974","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4482c64958a47d0ca953e176e52c847cf8a67dfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,130,198,73,88,164,125,12,169,83,225,118,229,44,132,124,248,166,125,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
