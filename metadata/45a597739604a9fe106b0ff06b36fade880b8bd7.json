Evolution by natural selection is probably the most powerful idea anyone ever had.\n\nIn this three-part series for Channel 4 (UK), Richard Dawkins, the evolutionary scientist and bestselling author, takes us on a journey of discovery. How does evolution work? How do we know itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s true - and why do some people still deny it? As evolved creatures, do we have to be callous, selfish and immoral? Dawkins echoes DarwinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s emphatic &quot;no&quot;.\n\nIn the course of his journey, Richard Dawkins visits a New York sperm bank and talks to the women about how they choose the genes of their children. He takes us to Lambeth Palace to visit the Archbishop of Canterbury - and to Kenya to visit that spectacularly well preserved fossil - the Turkana Boy. With its fascinating interviews, stunning photography and authoritative and good-humoured commentary, this series is a must for all who want to understand why we exist.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45a597739604a9fe106b0ff06b36fade880b8bd7","amp;dn":"The+Genius+of+Charles+Darwin++%28Richard+Dawkins+-+2008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45a597739604a9fe106b0ff06b36fade880b8bd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,165,151,115,150,4,169,254,16,107,15,240,107,54,250,222,136,11,139,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
