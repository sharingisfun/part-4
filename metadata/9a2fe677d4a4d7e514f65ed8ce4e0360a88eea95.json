They released several albums throughout the 1980s and are perhaps best-remembered today for their mid-1980s hit, &quot;Turn Up the Radio.&quot;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSign In Please is the debut album by the American rock band Autograph. Released in 1984, the album featured their signature song, &quot;Turn Up the Radio,&quot; and their other minor hit, &quot;Send Her to Me,&quot; both of which had accompanying videos.\n\n&quot;Turn Up the Radio&quot; was featured in a variety of media in the coming decades and is regarded as an '80s metal staple. &quot;All I'm Gonna Take&quot; was also featured in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories.\n\nAccording to lead guitarist Steve Lynch, the album took 30 days to record and master; &quot;We were seasoned musicians in the studio so worked very fast and were always well prepared.&quot; He also noted that its major hit, &quot;Turn Up the Radio,&quot; was recorded at the tail end of the Sign in Please sessions and that RCA didn't find it suitable enough for inclusion. However, after stern insistence, the band was able to get it on the album. Neither party, however, expected it to gain such critical success that led to the album's gold status in 1985.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a2fe677d4a4d7e514f65ed8ce4e0360a88eea95","amp;dn":"Autograph+-+Sign+In+Please+%5B1984%5D%5B2009%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a2fe677d4a4d7e514f65ed8ce4e0360a88eea95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,47,230,119,212,164,215,229,20,246,94,216,206,78,3,96,168,142,234,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
