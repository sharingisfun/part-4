While out on a run in the middle of the night, a young girl runs into him on the seaside boardwalk. Barefoot and terrified, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s running from a group of heavily armed men with one clear goalÃ¢â‚¬â€to kill the fleeing child. After Dryden helps her evade her pursuers, he learns that the eleven year old, for as long as she can remember, has been kept in a secret prison by forces within the government. But she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know much beyond her own name, Rachel. She only remembers the past two months of her lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€and that she has a skill that makes her very dangerous to these men and the hidden men in charge.\n\nDryden, who lost his wife and young daughter in an accident five years ago, agrees to help her try to unravel her own past and make sense of it, to protect her from the people who are moving heaven and earth to find them both. Although Dryden is only one man, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a man with the extraordinary skills and experienceÃ¢â‚¬â€as a Ranger, a Delta, and five years doing off-the-book black ops with an elite team. But, as he slowly begins to discover, the highly trained paramilitary forces on their heels is the only part of the danger they must face. Will RachelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own unremembered past be the most deadly of them all?\n\nEPUB AND MOBI.
