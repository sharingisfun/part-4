Presented by Dr Iain Stewart, each episode will reveal a different force critical to the development of Earth including volcanoes, the ocean, the atmosphere and ice. The series follows Dr Stewart&amp;#039;s personal journey to some of the most remote places on the planet, from abseiling down into a lava lake in Ethiopia to cave diving in the underwater caverns left by the impact of the meteorite that wiped out the dinosaurs. He will discover how volcanoes saved the planet, how a rainstorm lasted for thousands of years, and how the Mediterranean Sea once dried up. Each individual film highlights the delicate balance of life on Earth, and how its incredible history has been the story of disaster and recovery.\n\n5) Rare Earth \nIt has taken 4.6 billion years for the Earth to evolve from a barren rock into the world we know today. Explore the forces beyond our planet that have determined Earth&amp;#039;s destiny -- forces of destruction and regeneration in the solar system that created the planet and still protect it. And now the remarkable planet is facing a new challenge: humankind. The question is, how will it survive?\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------\n[img]http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/2117/earthpoweroftheplanetscqg7.th.jpg[/img] [img]http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/8809/earthpoweroftheplanetscuu3.th.jpg[/img] [img]http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/7056/earthpoweroftheplanetscja6.th.jpg[/img] [img]http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/9118/earthpoweroftheplanetscdl0.th.jpg[/img] [img]http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/2332/earthpoweroftheplanetscny2.th.jpg[/img] [img]http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/2646/earthpoweroftheplanetscjw6.th.jpg[/img] [img]http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/5234/earthpoweroftheplanetscsr9.th.jpg[/img] [img]http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/9831/earthpoweroftheplanetscyr2.th.jpg[/img] [img]http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/2718/earthpoweroftheplanetscpy5.th.jpg[/img] [img]http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/6017/earthpoweroftheplanetscyy2.th.jpg[/img] [img]http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/7337/earthpoweroftheplanetscsc7.th.jpg[/img] [img]http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/1379/earthpoweroftheplanetscll1.th.jpg[/img] \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n1) HD Cap [list]\n[*]Video Codec: x264 (2-pass)\n[*]Video bitrate: ~ 4850 kbps (avg)\n[*]Resolution: 1280x720 [mod16]\n[*]x264 Video profile: Level @ 4.1\n[*]Avg QP (avinaptic)[list]\n[*]Ep1: P = 21.93, B = 23.40, I = 20.17\n[*]Ep2: P = 20.79, B = 22.11, I = 18.98\n[*]Ep3: P = 19.79, B = 21.32, I = 18.29\n[*]Ep4: P = 21.76, B = 22.92, I = 20.00\n[*]Ep5: P = 21.25, B = 22.49, I = 19.41[/list]\n[*]Audio Codec: Dolby AC3\n[*]Audio Bitrate: 384 kbps\n[*]Channels: 6 (except ep2 with 2 ch)\n[*]Subtitles: English (muxed in)\n[*]Duration: ~ 59 min per ep\n[*]No of Episodes: 5\n[*]Ripped by MVGroup[/list]\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1) Further Information \n* BBC\n* University of Plymouth\n\n2) Related Documentaries \n* Volcano\n* Earth - The Biography\n* Earthquake Storms\n* The Ring of Fire\n* Super Volcanoes\n* Born of Fire\n* Journeys from the Centre of the Earth\n* The Earth&amp;#039;s Core\n* Birth of the Earth\n\n3) ed2k Links \n\nor\n\nSource: http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Earth_-_The_Power_of_the_Planet","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8694c75b3bd18558955c28a29cb2f2b9b9b0b75a","amp;dn":"BBC.Earth.Power.of.the.Planet.5of5.Rare.Earth.DVB.x264.720p.AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8694c75b3bd18558955c28a29cb2f2b9b9b0b75a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,148,199,91,59,209,133,88,149,92,40,162,156,178,242,185,185,176,183,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
