Unfortunately, independent animation distribution is spotty; Mutant Aliens (2000) presented continuity sketches for a feature film that, three years later, few have actually seen. Fortunately, Plympton's wackiness comes through strongly in storyboard form, so take in his new feature film via this book, and pray that the movie-distributing powers-that-be send it your way (double bill with Mutant Aliens--OK?). The story belongs to the high-school romance genre, with the brainy new kid, before his first day of school properly begins, falling afoul of the ruling football hero and being sentenced to be the big jock's girlfriend's &quot;slave&quot;--and DON'T fall in love with her! (Well, do, 'cause then jocko will have the pleasure of murdalizing you.) Guess what? Showing no compunctions about offing even major characters, Plympton blows a ton of high-school cliches into the stratosphere.
