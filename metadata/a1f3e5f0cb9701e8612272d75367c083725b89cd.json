I have transcoded every lossless file with the highest FLAC quality, thus wasting more cpu cycles, for the sake of lower file sizes. I did not scan any artwork, it's merely collected.\n\nFile naming scheme: (year - album/track - date), suitable even for cheap music players. Every album contains artwork (cover.jpg at the very least). Artwork was also reduced to a decent file size. I have also removed all the useless extra crap (nfo, m3u, txt, log) and converted complete disc rips to one track per file storage scheme, thus removing the cue sheets too. I like my music folders clean and my stuff organized.\n\nWhat's missing?\nlives - live at the marquee, scroe, chaos in motion - couldn't find them\nofficial bootlegs - pretty much everything except the 4 cover albums (metallica, maiden, purple, floyd)\n\n1989 - When Dream and Day Unite/\n1992 - Images And Words/\n1994 - Awake/\n1997 - Falling Into Infinity/\n1998 - Once in a LIVEtime/\n1999 - Metropolis Pt. 2 - Scenes From A Memory/\n2001 - Live Scenes From New York/\n2002 - Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence/\n2002 - When Dream And Day Unite (Remaster)/\n2003 - Train of Thought/\n2004 - Live At Budokan/\n2004 - Master Of Puppets/\n2004 - Octavarium/\n2005 - The Number Of The Beast/\n2006 - Dark Side Of The Moon/\n2007 - Made In Japan/\n2007 - Systematic Chaos/\n2008 - Greatest Hit (...And 21 Other Pretty Cool Songs)/\n2009 - Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1f3e5f0cb9701e8612272d75367c083725b89cd","amp;dn":"Dream+Theater+-+FLAC+studio+discography+%2B+live+albums+%2B+cover+al","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1f3e5f0cb9701e8612272d75367c083725b89cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,243,229,240,203,151,1,232,97,34,114,215,83,103,192,131,114,91,137,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
