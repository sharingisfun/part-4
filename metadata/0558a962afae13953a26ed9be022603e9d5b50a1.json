This torrent was taken from kick ass torrents and there is not A Torrent on the Pirate Bay form wonder share video editor for mac. \n\nWonder share has many different players encoders etc. This is the editor the only other program I know that exists for Macintosh is wonder share video encoder but is called aimersoft video encoder Ultimate copy. The program looks extremely similar to the current one that is for download on this torrent. I would not consider getting the program even on the bey. It only lets you choose one audio track and encodes subtitles hard. I would highly recommend getting handbrake you can add in multiple audio and subtitle tracks to the video. If you're having trouble with MKV then try IMKV extract. Some of the program is written in French but still can be used and it is very helpful.This program Will put together the audio and video files together in one once you have the video and you want to add subtitles soft subtitles then use handbrake If you need to convert the subtitles that you got from IMKV extract then I would suggest to download is Movcaptioner form http://www.synchrimedia.com. There is probably torrents for these Applications so go search them and you'll probably find them on the bay or kick ass Torrents and then either put them all together with handbrake(which I suggest) or Final Cut Pro X or 7 there in the top 100 Applications for Mac.\n\nRemember not to encode lots of videos or movies etc. Because that will put lots of stress on your computer Mac or Windows so if you have not make sure you have macs fan control or some sort of fan controlling software.\n\nAnd PLZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ !!!!SEED!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0558a962afae13953a26ed9be022603e9d5b50a1","amp;dn":"+%5BMac%5D+Wonder+share+video+editor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0558a962afae13953a26ed9be022603e9d5b50a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,88,169,98,175,174,19,149,58,38,237,155,224,34,96,62,157,91,80,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
