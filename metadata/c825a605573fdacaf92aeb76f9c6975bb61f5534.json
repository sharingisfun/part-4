Hill , Gordon A. Wyse, Margaret Anderson\n\n.\n\nPublication Date: March 23, 2012 | ISBN-10: 0878938982 | ISBN-13: 978-0878938988 | Edition: 3\n\nDescription\n\nAnimal Physiology presents all the branches of modern animal physiology with a strong emphasis on integration of physiological knowledge, ecology, and evolutionary biology. Integration extends from molecules to organ systems and from one physiological discipline to another. The book takes an entirely fresh approach to each topic. Its full-color illustrations include many novel, visually effective features to help students learn. Each of the 25 main chapters starts with a brief animal example to engage student interest and demonstrate the value of the material that will be learned. The book includes five additional, briefer Ã¢â‚¬Å“At WorkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ chapters that apply studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ newfound physiological knowledge to curiosity-provoking and important topics, including diving by marine mammals, the mechanisms of navigation, and muscle plasticity in use and disuse.\n\nThe book is committed to a comparative approach throughout. Whereas mammalian physiology is consistently treated in depth, emphasis is also given to the other vertebrate groups, arthropods, molluscs, andÃ¢â‚¬â€as appropriateÃ¢â‚¬â€additional invertebrates. Concepts and integrative themes are emphasized while giving students the specifics they need.\n\nThe whole animal is the principal focus of this book. The pages are filled with information on everything from knockout mice, genomics, and enzyme chemistry to traditional organ physiology, phylogenetic analysis, and applications to human affairs. Always, the central organizing principle for the array of topics presented is to understand whole animals in the environments where they live. Concepts from chemistry, physics, and mathematics are explained so that the book will be accessible to science students at the sophomore or higher level. Complex principles are developed clearly and carefully, to help students understand important concepts in sufficient depth without being overwhelmed. Pedagogical aids include embedded summaries throughout chapters, study questions, partially annotated reference lists, an extensive glossary, appendices, and an upgraded index. For all three authors, teaching physiology to undergraduate students has been a lifelong priority.\n\nThe opening five chapters provide background material on physiological basics, cellÃ¢â‚¬â€œmolecular concepts, genomics, physiological development, transport of solutes and water, ecology, and evolutionary biology. The remaining chapters are organized into five sections:\n\nFood, Energy, and Temperature\nIntegrating Systems\nMovement and Muscle\nOxygen, Carbon Dioxide, and Internal Transport\nWater, Salts, and Excretion\n\nWhat's New in This Edition\n\nA new chapter on physiological development and epigenetics (Chapter 4)\nAn entirely rewritten chapter on sensory processes, integrating latest research insights with organ-system physiology (Chapter 14)\nExtensive rewriting, reorganization, or expansion of chapters on aerobic and anaerobic metabolism (Chapter 8), activity energetics (Chapter 9), thermal relations (Chapter 10), osmoregulation (Chapter 28), and kidney function (Chapter 29)\nMore than 57 new figures or tables\nNew boxes written by expert guest authors on topics such as fMRI, magnetoreceptors in navigation, optogenetics, sleep, and symbiosis\nAll chapters updated based on the latest literature and terminology\nAll figures and text revised as needed for pedagogical effectiveness\nUpdated, in-depth lists of references to the scientific literature\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c825a605573fdacaf92aeb76f9c6975bb61f5534","amp;dn":"Animal+Physiology+3rd+Ed.+%5Btahir99%5D+V.R.G.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c825a605573fdacaf92aeb76f9c6975bb61f5534","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,37,166,5,87,63,218,202,249,42,235,118,249,198,151,91,182,31,85,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
