Formed in 2012 by lead singer/guitarist Keegan Calmes and keyboardist/backing vocalist Chris Senner, the group also includes bassist/backing vocalist Josh Pothier and drummer Nick Cesarz. Drawing favorable comparisons to such similarly inclined acts as the Killers, Two Door Cinema Club, and Death Cab for Cutie, the group reached the top spot on Billboard's Next Big Sound Chart in March of 2014. Also in 2014, they released their debut full-length album, Electrogram, on Fueled by Ramen","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0891209c81bf21e3576ff2ae49ee1a445229f378","amp;dn":"Vinyl+Theatre+-+Electrogram+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0891209c81bf21e3576ff2ae49ee1a445229f378","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,145,32,156,129,191,33,227,87,111,242,174,73,238,26,68,82,41,243,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
