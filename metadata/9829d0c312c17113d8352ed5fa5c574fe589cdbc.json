Never one to run with the crowd, Bella never cared about fitting in with the trendy, plastic girls at her Phoenix, Arizona high school. When her mother remarried and Bella chooses to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she didn't expect much of anything to change. But things do change when she meets the mysterious and dazzlingly beautiful Edward Cullen. For Edward is nothing like any boy she's ever met. He's nothing like anyone she's ever met, period. He's intelligent and witty, and he seems to see straight into her soul. In no time at all, they are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance - unorthodox because Edward really isn't like the other boys. He can run faster than a mountain lion. He can stop a moving car with his bare hands. Oh, and he hasn't aged since 1918. Like all vampires, he's immortal...\n\nGenre.....: Drama-Fantasy-Romance\nActors....: Kristen Stewart-Robert Pattinson-Billy Burke\nContainer.: MP4\nSource....: Blu-ray 2-pass Encoding\nVideo.....: H264 1280x528 1800kbps 23.976fps\nAudio.....: English AAC 48000Hz 319kbps 6ch \nRuntime...: 02:01:50 \nFilesize..: 1.85GB\nSubtitle..: English,Svenska\nMovie info: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1099212/\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Twilight Saga 2009 New Moon\n\nStoryline:\nAfter Bella recovers from the vampire attack that almost claimed her life, she looks to celebrate her birthday with Edward and his family.
