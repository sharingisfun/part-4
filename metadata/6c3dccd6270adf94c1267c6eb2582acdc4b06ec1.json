Intense, uncomfortable, dark and moving, OK Computer is the culmination of an incredible progression from Pablo Honey, through the flawed brilliance of The Bends, to an astounding third album which they may not be able to surpass. Apparently Thom Yorke almost went mad trying to decide the track order, but from the opening bars of Airbag, with it's uncomfortable, frankly bizarre, guitar line, to the microwave oven's ring that marks the end of The Tourist, the whole is incontestably a journey of the brain, the heart and the senses that seems to make perfect sense.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 67\nArtist: Radiohead\nAlbum: Ok Computer\nYear: 1997\nGenre: Rock\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c3dccd6270adf94c1267c6eb2582acdc4b06ec1","amp;dn":"Radiohead+-+OK+Computer+%5BFLAC-1997%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c3dccd6270adf94c1267c6eb2582acdc4b06ec1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,61,204,214,39,10,223,148,193,38,124,110,178,88,42,205,196,176,110,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
