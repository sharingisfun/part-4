Streetwise, tough and savvy, his quick sarcasm is the stuff of legends. . .until the night when his best friends try to kill him. Saved by a mysterious warrior who has more fighting skills than Chuck Norris, Nick is sucked into the realm of the Dark-Hunters: immortal vampire slayers who risk everything to save humanity.\n\nNick quickly learns that the human world is only a veil for a much larger and more dangerous one: a world where the captain of the football team is a werewolf and the girl he has a crush on goes out at night to stake the undead.\n\nBut before he can even learn the rules of this new world, his fellow students are turning into flesh eating zombies. And he's next on the menu.\n\nAs if starting high school isn't hard enough. . .now Nick has to hide his new friends from his mom, his chainsaw from the principal, and keep the zombies and the demon Simi from eating his brains, all without getting grounded or suspended. How in the world is he supposed to do that?\n\nBook 2: Invincible (Chronicles of Nick, #2) by Sherrilyn Kenyon (March 22nd 2011)\n\nNick GautierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s day just keeps getting better and better. Yeah, he survived the zombie attacks, only to wake up and find himself enslaved to a world of shapeshifters and demons out to claim his soul.\n\nHis new principal thinks heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s even more of a hoodlum than the last one, his coach is trying to recruit him to things he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even mention and the girl heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not seeing, but is, has secrets that terrify him.\n\nBut more than that, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s being groomed by the darkest of powers and if he doesn't learn how to raise the dead by the end of the week, he will become one of them...\n\nBook 3: Infamous (Chronicles of Nick, #3) by Sherrilyn Kenyon (March 13th 2012)\n\nThe world has fallen in love with Nick Gautier and the Dark-Hunters. Now Nick's saga continues in the next eagerly anticipated volume...\n\nGo to school. Get good grades. Stay out of trouble. That's the mandate for most kids. But Nick Gautier isn't the average teenager. He's a boy with a destiny not even he fully understands. And his first mandate is to stay alive while everyone, even his own father, tries to kill him. He's learned to raise the dead, divination and clairvoyance, so why is learning to drive and keep a girlfriend so hard?\n\nBut driving isn't the primary skill he has to master. Survival is. And in order to survive, his next lesson makes all the others pale in comparison. He is on the brink of becoming either the greatest hero mankind has ever known - or he'll be the one who ends the world. With enemies new and old gathering forces, he will have to call on every part of himself to fight or he'll lose everyone he cares about. Even himself.\n\nBook 4: Inferno (Chronicles of Nick, #4) by Sherrilyn Kenyon (April 9th 2013) \n\nThe heat is on, and a new threat to humanity has risenÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nNick has his driverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s license and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not afraid to use it. But turning sixteen isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t what he thought it would be. While other boys his age are worried about prom dates and applying for college, Nick is neck deep in enemies out to stop him from living another day. No longer sure if he can trust anyone, his only ally seems to be the one person heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been told will ultimately kill him.\n\nBut life spent serving the undead is anything except ordinary. And those out to get him have summoned an ancient force so powerful even the gods fear it. As Nick learns to command and control the elements, the one he must master in order to combat his latest foe is the one most likely to destroy him. As the old proverb goes, fire knows nothing of mercy, and if Nick is to survive this latest round, he will have to sacrifice a part of himself. However, the best sacrifice is seldom the sanest move. Sometimes itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the one that leaves your enemies confused, and you even more so.\n\nAnd sometimes, you have to trust your enemy to save your friends. But what do you do when that enemy is you?\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2f1286354333dbafd202e83c172ba77c3ea9408","amp;dn":"Chronicles+of+Nick+%281-4%29+by+Sherrilyn+Kenyon+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2f1286354333dbafd202e83c172ba77c3ea9408","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,241,40,99,84,51,61,186,253,32,46,131,193,114,186,119,195,234,148,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
