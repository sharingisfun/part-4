Birdy Nam Nam has won several prizes throughout their career including the DMC Technics 2002 World TEAM Championships.

Their self-titled debut album was released in 2006 on Uncivilized World Records, and in March of that year, they performed at the internationally-renowned music conference SXSW. The group's name is taken from a line in the 1968 Peter Sellers film The Party, directed by Blake Edwards.\n\n\nArtist...............: Birdy Nam Nam\nAlbum................: Discography \nGenre................: Electronic\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: (2005-2014)\nRipper...............: NMR\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............: NMR\nPosted by............: vtwin88cube on 4/12/2014\nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: Cue, Log, AUDIOCHECKER\nCovers...............: Front\n\n\nDiscography -\n\n\nBirdy Nam Nam (2005)\n\nLive (2006)\n\nManual For Successful Rioting (2009)\n\nDefiant Order (2011)\n\nDefiant Order Remixes Project (2014)\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n  Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3f627d77c3414eff09cba6f5a5bbb596f90513b","amp;dn":"Birdy+Nam+Nam+-+Discography+%282005-2014%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3f627d77c3414eff09cba6f5a5bbb596f90513b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,246,39,215,124,52,20,239,240,156,186,111,90,91,187,89,111,144,81,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
