The songs are still heavy (#3, #5) but there is also the addition of a few instruments - even acoustic guitars. The lyrics are, as always, amazing and the melodies catchy as hell. You can't say that about many hard-rock bands, but Clutch is about as unique as they come. This album encompasses all the things they are famous for - groovy rock, driving rhythms, humorous, pointed, and well-informed writing. Neil's literary flair is ever present on this release. \n \n -- We *stole* this review from amazon.com; Allmusic.com didn't have one up yet. \n Sowwie. :) \n \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Mercury [03:00] \n 02.Profits of doom [03:13] \n 03.The mob goes wild [03:32] \n 04.Cypress grove [02:46] \n 05.Promoter [03:14] \n 06.Regulator [05:25] \n 07.Worm drink [03:14] \n 08.Army of bono [04:37] \n 09.Spleen merchant [02:38] \n 10.The swollen goat [03:02] \n 11.Weather maker [00:48] \n 12.Subtle hustle [02:47] \n 13.Ghost [04:38] \n 14.La curandera [05:49] \n 15.WYSIWYG [05:49] \n ____ \n \n 54:32 min \n 87,0 MB ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce633d9f5f8232133dd20be50a739eaae02bcebb","amp;dn":"Clutch-Blast_Tyrant-%28Retail%29-2004-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce633d9f5f8232133dd20be50a739eaae02bcebb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,99,61,159,95,130,50,19,61,210,11,229,10,115,158,170,224,43,206,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
