The vinyl has been and still is highly sought after,\ngenuine copies have sold for upwards of 700 euros on auction sites and has been bootlegged extensively by\nunscrupulous sellers. Unofficial reprints have surfaced overtime, a Japanese edition was released with coloured vinyl, but all were mastered\nfrom the CD version. Some of the worse bootlegs only presented the album in mono and many a poor collector has paid\nvast amounts of money in that pursuit of owning a genuine copy only to be stung.\n\nBack in '92 we had proper record stores all across the UK and I found myself browsing the racks of the local HMV and stumbled across Waters new album\non both CD and Vinyl, looks like I made the right choice. I spent some time with the album back then but was never really taken with it and it ended up being\npacked away in my garage where its sat for the best part of twenty years gathering dust.... over time I have revisited it now and again on CD and come to acknowledge\nit as Waters Solo masterpiece. \n\nRecently I decided to search that old vinyl out and give it a spin, well, twenty years in my garage hadn't been kind, the packaging wasn't to bad but the surface\nof the vinyl had obviously suffered so I set about restoring it. I have a few tricks in my repertoire,\nI painted 'Copydex' ( liquid rubber ) on each side, allowing it to set before gently pulling it and the dirt off again in one perfect disk shaped mirror image of the grooves, not once but three times.\nGot myself some cleaning fluid and gave them most of the bottle, finally used an anti static cloth and was ready to go. What a revelation, sure there were still a few pops here and there\nbut the sound was outstanding, better than any current CD or digital download.\n\nSo I set myself another task I'll rip it just for my personal collection, had no intention of uploading.. then I figured what the hell?. \n\nEach side of the Vinyl is presented here as one FLAC file because the songs flow into each other and the album should be heard as a whole. I have also included two Comparison Files\nin MP3, one from CD and one from a mix down of this rip for you to compare. Remember its not perfect, the record is over twenty years old, so expect the odd glitch here and there. \n\nFinally, I don't expect this to be an overly popular download but I hope those that do grab it Enjoy it as much as I have had doing it, my inner geek is happy indeed. Beolab.   \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n  \n[/center]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f40c861e7a3d4548296199bde20a91a66259bb88","amp;dn":"Roger+Waters+-+Amused+To+Death+%281992%29+%5BColumbia+2+%26times%3B+Vinyl%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f40c861e7a3d4548296199bde20a91a66259bb88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,12,134,30,122,61,69,72,41,97,153,189,226,10,145,166,98,89,187,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
