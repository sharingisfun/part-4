Overall, however, I felt the story was spoiled by an interminable running time, unengaging plot tangents and constant narrative filibustering. What especially saddened me was how Bilbo (the supposed protagonist of the story) was rendered absent for large sections of the films. Back in 2012, I had high hopes of adding The Hobbit to my annual Lord of the Rings marathon, but in its current bloated format, I know that is just never going to happen.\n\nSo, over the weekend, I decided to condense all three movies (An Unexpected Journey, The Desolation of Smaug &amp; The Battle of the Five Armies) into a single 4-hour feature that more closely resembles TolkienÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original novel. Well, okay, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s closer to 4.5 hours, but those credits go for ages! This new version was achieved through a series of major and minor cuts, detailed below:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The investigation of Dol Guldor has been completely excised, including the appearances of Radagast, Saruman and Galadriel. This was the most obvious cut, and the easiest to carry out (a testament to its irrelevance to the main narrative). Like the novel, Gandalf abruptly disappears on the borders of Mirkwood, and then reappears at the siege of the Lonely Mountain with tidings of an orc army.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The Tauriel-Legolas-Kili love triangle has also been removed. Indeed, Tauriel is no longer a character in the film, and Legolas only gets a brief cameo during the Mirkwood arrest. This was the next clear candidate for elimination, given how little plot value and personality these two woodland sprites added to the story. Dwarves are way more fun to hang out with anyway :P\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The Pale Orc subplot is vastly trimmed down. Azog is obviously still leading the attack on the Lonely Mountain at the end, but he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t appear in the film until after the company escapes the goblin tunnels (suggesting that the slaying of the Great Goblin is a factor in their vendetta, as it was in the novel).\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Several of the Laketown scenes have been cut, such as BardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s imprisonment and the superfluous orc raid. However, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve still left quite a bit of it in, since I felt it succeeded in getting the audience to care about the down-beaten fisherfolk, and the struggles of Bard to protect them.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The prelude with old Bilbo is gone. Like the book, I find the film works better if the scope starts out small (in a cosy hobbit hole), and then grows organically as Bilbo ventures out into the big, scary world. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s far more elegant to first learn about Smaug from the dwarvesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ haunting ballad (rather than a bombastic CGI sequence). The prelude also undermines the real-and-present stakes of the story by framing it as one big flashback.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Several of the orc skirmishes have been cut. I felt that the Battle of the Five Armies provided more than enough orc mayhem. If you pack in too many before then, they just become monotonous, and it lessons their menace in the audienceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mind. I was tempted to leave the first Azog fight in (since it resembles a chapter in the novel), but decided to cut it for a variety of reasons. Mainly, because it was tonally jarring to jump from the emotional crescendo of Thorin being saved by Bilbo (and the sense of safety the company feels after being rescued by the eagles), straight back into a chase sequence again. Plus, I think the film works better if Bilbo is still trying to earn ThorinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s respect the entire journey, as he was in the book. Not to mention the absurdity of Bilbo suddenly turning into John McClane with a sword!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Several of the action scenes have been tightened up, such as the barrel-ride, the fight between Smaug and the dwarves (no molten gold in this version), and the Battle of the Five Armies. Though, it should be noted that BilboÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s key scenesÃ¢â‚¬â€the encounter with Gollum, the battle against the Mirkwood spiders, and the conversation with SmaugÃ¢â‚¬â€have not been tampered with, since they proved to be excellent adaptions (in no small part due to FreemanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s performance), and serve to refocus the film on BilboÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arc.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A lot of filler scenes have been cut as well. These are usually harder to spot (and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve probably missed a couple), but once theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re gone, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll completely forget that they ever existed. For example, the 4-minute scene where Bard buys some fish and the dwarves gather up his pay.\n\nMy main goals in undertaking this edit were to re-centre the story on Bilbo, and to have the narrative move at a much brisker pace (though not so fast that the audience lost grasp of what was going on). Creating smooth transitions between scenes was of particular importance in this regard. I even reordered a few moments in the film to make it flow better. The toughest parts to edit were the barrel-ride and the fight on Ravenhill (since Legolas and Tauriel kept bursting in with their gymnastics routine).\n\nAnyway, I hope you enjoy it. \n\nI used 720Ãƒâ€”576 MP4s for the recut. The resolution is slightly reduced after a few exports, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still comparable to DVD quality.\n\nThis was a labour of love, so please share and seed. And feel free to reupload the video and post your own links wherever you want.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“May the hair on your toes never fall out.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nTolkienEditor :)\n\nUpdate (22 Jan): Apologies for the delay, but I have uploaded the 6GB version of the recut. This version also has a few alterations, based on peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s requests, including trimming down the chase sequence through the goblin tunnels; colour correcting the transition from the Misty Mountains to BeornÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house; taking out the Bombur Ã¢â‚¬Å“barrel bounceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (which is apparently the bane of some peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s existence); and tidying up the final fight on Ravenhill. I have no idea how to remove the gold-coating from Smaug, though. I tried a few variations, but none of them work very well. So, this is the final version of the recut, for good or ill. :P\n\nNow, I do want to temper peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expectations for the 6GB version. Considering the difference in size, the quality isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t dramatically better. Rather, it is somewhere between a DVD and Blu-ray. The screenshots are a good indication. That said, the image is sharper, and the colours are a little more vibrant (than the 2 GB version), so itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s probably preferable for people who would like to watch the recut on a big-screen TV.\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fDH789G.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fDH789G.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/stECT7j.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/stECT7j.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/kdM09AJ.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/kdM09AJ.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/eHaT4nU.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/eHaT4nU.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/BnRiTb9.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/BnRiTb9.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/rfQCsNR.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/rfQCsNR.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCover Art:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/H3gjP2G.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/H3gjP2G.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2290b6d5e51041b8b96fed5ab97ee30030da4cc","amp;dn":"The+Hobbit+-+The+Tolkien+Edit+by+TolkienEditor+%28FanEdit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2290b6d5e51041b8b96fed5ab97ee30030da4cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,41,11,109,94,81,4,27,139,150,254,213,171,151,238,48,3,13,164,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
