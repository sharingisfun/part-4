We added a powerful yet very simple to use anti-ghosting mask feature. Just paint over all instances of the moved objects (you don't even have to be very precise!) and it will without trace completely eliminate the ghosts from the final image. In Full version you can use Live HDR function. Just press Quick Preview button that will almost instantly show you the result HDR image with the anti-ghosting mask applied.\n\nSilky-smooth sky\n\nA common problem with over-processed HDR images is adding halo and noise blocks in large smooth areas such as clean sky.\n\n3D Sky filter automatically adjust the tone-mapping to preserve the smoothness of the sky (Even if you really step on the &quot;HDR effect&quot; pedal as we did with the image below) And we added one for Skin too, so now you can tone-map portraits as well.\n\n3D sky\n\nAdd Effect to Video\nMaybe you like to experiment with a video.
