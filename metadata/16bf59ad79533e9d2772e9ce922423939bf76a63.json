Recent pioneering experiments in neuroplasticityÃ¢â‚¬â€œthe ability of the brain to change in response to experienceÃ¢â‚¬â€œreveal that the brain is capable of altering its structure and function, and even of generating new neurons, a power we retain well into old age. The brain can adapt, heal, renew itself after trauma, compensate for disabilities, rewire itself to overcome dyslexia, and break cycles of depression and OCD. And as scientists are learning from studies performed on Buddhist monks, it is not only the outside world that can change the brain, so can the mind and, in particular, focused attention through the classic Buddhist practice of mindfulness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16bf59ad79533e9d2772e9ce922423939bf76a63","amp;dn":"Train+Your+Mind%2C+Change+Your+Brain%3A+How+a+New+Science+Reveals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16bf59ad79533e9d2772e9ce922423939bf76a63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,191,89,173,121,83,62,157,39,114,233,206,146,36,35,147,155,247,106,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
