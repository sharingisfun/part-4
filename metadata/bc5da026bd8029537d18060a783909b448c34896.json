And some people say that the only way to make pizza more delicious is to add extra cheese, but John Delpha, member of the award-winning barbecue team, IQUE, has an even better option - grilling your pizza. Grilling pizza is the only way to get the perfect consistency and flavour. The crust is crunchy, but has a little bit of a chew to it, and the cheese is perfectly melted with a nice smoky flavour, so when you take the first bite you will be amazed. After all, John Delpha did hone his grilled pizza techniques at Al Forno in Providence, an award-winning restaurant famous for inventing grilled pizza.\n\nEPUB,Retail.208 pages\nPublisher: Page Street Publishing (March 10, 2015)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1624140971\nISBN-13: 978-1624140976","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc5da026bd8029537d18060a783909b448c34896","amp;dn":"Grilled+Pizza+the+Right+Way+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29+%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc5da026bd8029537d18060a783909b448c34896","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,93,160,38,189,128,41,83,125,24,6,10,120,57,9,180,72,195,72,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
