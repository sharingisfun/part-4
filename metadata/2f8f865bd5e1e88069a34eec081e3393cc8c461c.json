Strike is down to one client, and creditors are calling. He has also just broken up with his longtime girlfriend and is living in his office.\n\nThen John Bristow walks through his door with an amazing story: His sister, thelegendary supermodel Lula Landry, known to her friends as the Cuckoo, famously fell to her death a few months earlier. The police ruled it a suicide, but John refuses to believe that. The case plunges Strike into the world of multimillionaire beauties, rock-star boyfriends, and desperate designers, and it introduces him to every variety of pleasure, enticement, seduction, and delusion known to man.\n\nYou may think you know detectives, but you've never met one quite like Strike. You may think you know about the wealthy and famous, but you've never seen them under an investigation like this.\n\nFull US Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready. Metadata is complete and up to date.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f8f865bd5e1e88069a34eec081e3393cc8c461c","amp;dn":"The+Cuckoo%27s+Calling+by+Robert+Galbraith+%28US+Retail+ePub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f8f865bd5e1e88069a34eec081e3393cc8c461c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,143,134,91,213,225,232,128,105,163,78,236,8,30,51,147,204,140,70,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
