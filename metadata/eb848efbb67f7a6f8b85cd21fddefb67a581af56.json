This book offers a possible way out of our recurring cycles of boom and recession, famine, poverty, a declining environment, and territorial conflicts where peace is merely the interval between wars. It outlines an attainable, humane social design of the near future where human rights are no longer paper proclamations but a way of life. The Best That Money Can't Buy is a challenge to all people to work toward a society in which all of the world's resources become the common heritage of all of the earth's people. It is accompanied by 70 color photos of Fresco's original designs, which illuminate the fulfilling lifestyle of a global, resource-based economy.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb848efbb67f7a6f8b85cd21fddefb67a581af56","amp;dn":"The+Best+That+Money+Can%5C%27t+Buy%3A+Beyond+Politics%2C+Poverty%2C+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb848efbb67f7a6f8b85cd21fddefb67a581af56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,132,142,251,182,127,122,111,139,133,205,33,253,222,251,103,165,129,175,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
