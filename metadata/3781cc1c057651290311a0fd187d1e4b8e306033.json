Now, in an electrifying departure, he presents a novel that breaks all the rules and will keep your heart racing and your mind guessing until the very last page. \n\nDeath is reporter Jack McEvoy's beat: his calling, his obsession. But this time, death brings McEvoy the story he never wanted to write--and the mystery he desperately needs to solve. A serial killer of unprecedented savagery and cunning is at large. His targets: homicide cops, each haunted by a murder case he couldn't crack. The killer's calling card: a quotation from the works of Edgar Allen Poe. His latest victim is McEvoy's own brother. And his last...may be McEvoy himself.\n\nPublisher: Grand Central Publishing; 1st edition (January 14, 1997)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0446602612\nISBN-13: 978-0446602617\n\nCome &amp; Join Suprbay; Post Requests, Suggestions &amp; Surf the TPB Forum. \n\n                                              &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/index.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\n__________________\n\n\nAnd, My Link On Suprbay:\n                                              &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Promising-ebooks-Audio-Books-Torrents-by-The-Abee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Promising-ebooks-Audio-Books-Torrents-by-The-Abee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGet me there. :)\n\n\n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n\n\n\n                                                     :)__Abee","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3781cc1c057651290311a0fd187d1e4b8e306033","amp;dn":"The+Poet+%28Jack+McEvoy+%231%29+by+Michael+Connelly+ABEE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3781cc1c057651290311a0fd187d1e4b8e306033","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,129,204,28,5,118,81,41,3,17,160,253,24,125,30,75,142,48,96,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
