Charles Maurice \r\nFormat: PDF \r\nHardcover: 736 pages \r\nPublisher: McGraw-Hill Education; 12 edition (September 22, 2015) \r\nLanguage: English \r\nISBN: 978-0078021909 \r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of Thomas and Maurice's Managerial Economics is to teach students the economic way of thinking about business decision and strategy. This edition continues to develop critical thinking skills and provides students with a logical way of analysing both the routine decisions of managing the daily operations of a business as well as the longer-run strategic plans that seek to manipulate the actions and reactions of rival firms.\r\nManagerial Economics is a self-contained textbook that requires no previous training in economics. While maintaining a rigorous style, this book is designed to be one of the most accessible books in managerial economics from which to teach and learn because of its clarity of presentation and strong end of chapter problems. Rather than parading students quickly through every interesting or new topic in microeconomics and industrial organization, this 12th edition instead carefully develops and applies the most useful concepts for business decision making and strategic planning","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:597c89541d5cd57611d3fe529956eb20da861e70","amp;dn":"Managerial+Economics%2C+12th+Edition+%5B2015%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"597c89541d5cd57611d3fe529956eb20da861e70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,124,137,84,29,92,213,118,17,211,254,82,153,86,235,32,218,134,30,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
