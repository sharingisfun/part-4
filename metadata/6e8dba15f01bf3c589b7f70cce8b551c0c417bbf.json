Master craftsman Sam Rizzetta presents three attractive innovations: a new building method that makes Kevlar and carbon-fiber boats cheap and feasible for home builders; an ergonomically designed canoe that makes paddling easier and more comfortable; and a foam-flotation installation method that makes canoes and kayaks safe and unsinkable.\nAbout the Author\n\nSam Rizzetta is a boat designer and builder, a master luthier (a builder of stringed, fretted musical instruments), a music historian, a composites fabricator, and author. A canoeist since the age of three, he has designed and built numerous canoes and averages 1,000 miles of paddling annually. His innovative Fabric Form method of boatbuilding is an offshoot of his work in the fabrication of custom composite aeronautical components.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 256 pages\n    * Publisher: International Marine/Ragged Mountain Press; 1 edition (March 25, 2009)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0071597352\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0071597357","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e8dba15f01bf3c589b7f70cce8b551c0c417bbf","amp;dn":"Canoe+and+Kayak+Building+the+Light+and+Easy+Way%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e8dba15f01bf3c589b7f70cce8b551c0c417bbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,141,186,21,240,27,243,197,137,183,247,12,206,139,85,28,12,65,123,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
