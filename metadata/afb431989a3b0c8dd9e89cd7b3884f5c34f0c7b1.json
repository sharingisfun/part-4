The First 20 Hits is a greatest hits collection from Erasure, released in 1992 by Mute Records in the UK and Elektra Records\n in the US. The album utilises a straightforward format: all of Erasure's singles up to that point, sequenced in chronological\n order with the addition of the Hamburg Mix of Erasure's first ever single, Who Needs Love (Like That).\nIn the UK, &quot;Who Needs Love Like That&quot; was released as a single in remixed form (&quot;The Hamburg Mix&quot;, a reference to Erasure's\n extensive touring of Hamburg during the band's formative period). This is included as a bonus track on the UK version of the\n album, although in the US it only appears on the cassette release, failing to appear on the CD.\nPop! The First 20 Hits became Erasure's fourth consecutive number-one album in the UK. In Germany the album hit number 12 and \nin the US it peaked at number 112 on the Billboard 200, where it was certified Gold nearly 10 years later by the RIAA.\n\n=========================================\n\nTracklist\n\n01 Who Needs Love (Like That).flac\n02 Heavenly Action.flac\n03 Oh L'amour.flac\n04 Sometimes.flac\n05 It Doesn't Have To Be.flac\n06 Victim Of Love.flac\n07 The Circus.flac\n08 Ship Of Fools.flac\n09 Chains Of Love.flac\n10 A Little Respect.flac\n11 Stop!.flac\n12 Drama!.flac\n13 You Surround Me.flac\n14 Blue Savannah.flac\n15 Star.flac\n16 Chorus.flac\n17 Love To Hate You.flac\n18 Am I Right.flac\n19 Breath Of Life.flac\n20 Take A Chance On Me.flac\n21 Who Needs Love (Like That) (Hamburg Mix).flac\n\n============================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 518 MB\nAlbum                                    : Pop! 20 Hits\nTrack name/Total                         : 21\nComposer                                 : Erasure\nGenre                                    : Synthpop\nRecorded date                            : 1992\nComment                                  : EAC V1.0 beta 2, Secure Mode, Test &amp; Copy, AccurateRip, FLAC -8\nAlbum/Composer                           : Erasure / Erasure\n\n=====================================\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : FLAC\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 907 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afb431989a3b0c8dd9e89cd7b3884f5c34f0c7b1","amp;dn":"Erasure+-+Pop%21+20+Hits+%281992%29+Flac-Cue+-+ausy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afb431989a3b0c8dd9e89cd7b3884f5c34f0c7b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,180,49,152,154,59,12,141,217,232,156,215,179,136,79,92,52,240,199,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
