Hoath (Wiley-VCH, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nFrom droplet formation to final applications, this practical book presents the subject in a comprehensive and clear form, using only content derived from the latest published results.\r\nStarting at the very beginning, the topic of fluid mechanics is explained, allowing for a suitable regime for printing inks to subsequently be selected. There then follows a discussion on different print-head types and how to form droplets, covering the behavior of droplets in flight and upon impact with the substrate, as well as the droplet's wetting and drying behavior at the substrate. Commonly observed effects, such as the coffee ring effect, are included as well as printing in the third dimension. The book concludes with a look at what the future holds. As a unique feature, worked examples both at the practical and simulation level, as well as case studies are included. \r\nAs a result, students and engineers in R&amp;D will come to fully understand the complete process of inkjet printing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:523ef8ecbdd14447029b766a6e276e0b6e41afcb","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Inkjet+Printing+-+The+Science+of+Inkjet+and+Drop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"523ef8ecbdd14447029b766a6e276e0b6e41afcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,62,248,236,189,209,68,71,2,155,118,106,110,39,110,11,110,65,175,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
