Following yesterday's album listening party, the Australian producer took to Twitter to confirm the release date of his debut studio album, &quot;Speed Of Life&quot;, for March 5th, a mere week before UMF Miami kicks off it's 2013 edition.\n\nWhile little is still known about the album and with a public preview yet to surface, the general response from the select few that was treated to the full thing at Los Angeles' The Village Recording Studios last night suggests that &quot;Speed Of Life&quot; will go down as a successful landmark for the Phazing head honcho.\n\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c228bb8047bb8691732c87030ee06178fc977d9","amp;dn":"Dirty+South+-+Speed+Of+Life+%282013%29+Album+%2F+MP3+%40+320+Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c228bb8047bb8691732c87030ee06178fc977d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,34,139,184,4,123,184,105,23,50,200,112,48,238,6,23,143,201,119,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
