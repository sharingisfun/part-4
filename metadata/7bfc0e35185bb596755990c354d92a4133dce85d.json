In Extras, two genial low-level gangsters are hired to stage an attack, but they're mere sacrificial lambs in a political conspiracy. Rebels strive to preserve destroyed homes and objects as specimens in the mesmerizing Season of the End. In Dialect, a taxi driver struggles to adjust after Putonghua displaces Cantonese as Hong Kong's only official language. Following the death of a leading independence activist, an act of self-immolation outside the British consulate triggers questions and protests in the searing yet moving Self-Immolator. In Local Egg, a grocery shop owner worries about his son's youth guard activities and where to buy eggs after Hong Kong's last chicken farm closes down.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the film is split into 2 files (I was unable to join them successfully) and subtitles are hardcoded, but the quality is good.\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy and share","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bfc0e35185bb596755990c354d92a4133dce85d","amp;dn":"Ten+Years+%28Sap+Nin%29+2015+720p+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bfc0e35185bb596755990c354d92a4133dce85d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,252,14,53,24,91,181,150,117,89,144,195,84,217,42,65,51,220,232,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
