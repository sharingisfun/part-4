Hawkins was consecrated to the bishopic in 1992. Bishop Hawkins started his career in one of his brother's chorales, &quot;The Northern California State Youth Choir&quot; of the Church of God in Christ. Later, he accompanied his brother Edwin and founded The Edwin Hawkins Singers. This collaborative effort produced the hit song &quot;Oh Happy Day&quot;, which became one of the first gospel songs to cross over onto mainstream music charts.\n\nWalter Hawkins left The Edwin Hawkins Singers in the early 1970s to establish the Love Center Church in Oakland, California. He and his Love Center Choir had considerable success with their &quot;Love Alive&quot; series of recordings, which sold well over a million copies from the 1970s through the 1990s. &quot;Love Alive IV&quot;, released in 1990, was No. 1 on the Billboard Gospel Album charts, where it stayed for 33 weeks.
