Quickly navigate between nested comps with the new Mini-Flowchart.\n\nCompositions exported as layered projects\nExport compositions as layered, XFL format projects that can be opened and edited in Adobe FlashÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® CS4 Professional software. Many After Effects assets such as text and Adobe IllustratorÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® artwork are preserved as vectors.\n\nIntegrated workflow for mobile device authoring\nSelect devices in Adobe Device Central and automatically set up an After Effects project that targets those devices, with settings that match the targeted devices and the Render Queue setup to output to the proper codecs and resolutions.\n\nNumerous interface and workflow tweaks\nWork more efficiently with dozens of user-requested changes, including the new Auto Resolution setting that only renders visible pixels when zooming in and out of a comp view, streamlined memory and multicore processing preferences, and more.\n\nDynamic Link between Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Soundbooth\nUsing Adobe Creative SuiteÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 4 Production Premium software, now link Adobe PremiereÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Pro sequences to an After Effects composition and After Effects comps to Adobe SoundboothÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® with Adobe Dynamic Link.\n\nIndependent keyframing of x, y, z values, plus 3D compositing improvements\nComposite in 3D space more easily: Keyframe x, y, and z position values separately, and use the new unified camera, which makes the After Effects camera tool work more like those in 3D modeling applications.\n\nCartoon effect\nInstantly give live footage the look of cell animation. Stylize video by reducing the color palette of a clip and by emphasizing edges.\n\nMocha for Adobe After Effects from Imagineer Systems\nUse this powerful 2.5D planar tracking application from Imagineer Systems to track the motion of elements ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ even in challenging shots where elements move offscreen or where there is motion blur or excessive grain.\n\nXMP metadata for asset intelligence\nNow retain asset metadata while you work in After Effects. Add new project-, comp-, and layer-level metadata to streamline project tracking, and automate asset auditing and many other tasks.\n\nSystem requirements\n1.5GHz or faster processor*\nMicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP with Service Pack 2 (Service Pack 3 recommended) or Windows VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Home Premium, Business, Ultimate, or Enterprise with Service Pack 1 (certified for 32-bit Windows XP and 32-bit and 64-bit Windows Vista)\n2GB of RAM\n1.3GB of available hard-disk space for installation, plus 2GB of space for optional content; additional free space required during installation (cannot install on flash-based storage devices)\n1,280x900 display with OpenGL 2.0ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“compatible graphics card\nDVD-ROM drive\nQuickTime 7.4.5 software required to use QuickTime features\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMade by DemoShadow, for myself, but I know how to share...\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed15736641d11b14e90f96d8e913a34603650533","amp;dn":"Adobe+After+Effects+CS4+Portable+-+DemoShadow+-+445mb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed15736641d11b14e90f96d8e913a34603650533","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,21,115,102,65,209,27,20,233,15,150,216,233,19,163,70,3,101,5,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
