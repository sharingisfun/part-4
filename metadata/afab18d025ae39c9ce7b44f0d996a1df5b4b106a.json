The album was recorded as a tribute to the late Ronnie James Dio and consists of covers of songs from Dio, Black Sabbath and Rainbow, with one original composition written for Ronnie James Dio. \r\n\r\nLande describes the album as a &quot;fine collection of songs that present the music of the Man and the Artist, with a unique twist&quot; and a &quot;sincere and heartfelt â€œthank youâ€ to a great and influential Artist&quot; who &quot;has affected my life and career in such a way that without his presence, I would not have become the artist I am today&quot;\r\nAnd Jorn continues to cover Dio songs solo and Sabbath. And he does them very well.\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\n01 Song For Ronnie James.mp3\r\n02 Invisible.mp3\r\n03 Shame On The Night.mp3\r\n04 Push.mp3\r\n05 Stand Up And Shout.mp3\r\n06 Don't Talk To Strangers.mp3\r\n07 Lord Of The Last Day.mp3\r\n08 Night People.mp3\r\n09 Sacred Heart.mp3\r\n10 Sunset Superman.mp3\r\n11 Lonely Is The WordLetters From Earth.mp3\r\n12 Kill The King.mp3\r\n13 Straight Through The Heart (Live).mp3\r\n14 The Mob Rules.mp3\r\n15 Rock and Roll Children.mp3\r\n16 Rainbow in the Dark.mp3\r\n17 The Man Who Was King.mp3\r\n18 Die Young.mp3\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel\r\n\r\n    JÃ¸rn Lande - lead vocals\r\n    Tor Erik Myhre - guitars\r\n    Igor Gianola - guitars\r\n    Tore Moren - guitars\r\n    Nic Angileri - bass\r\n    Willy Bendiksen - drums, percussion\r\n\r\nAdditional personnel\r\n\r\n    Tommy Hansen - keyboards","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afab18d025ae39c9ce7b44f0d996a1df5b4b106a","amp;dn":"Jorn+-+Dio+%28Deluxe+ak+Edition%29+2016+256ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afab18d025ae39c9ce7b44f0d996a1df5b4b106a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,171,24,208,37,174,57,201,206,123,68,240,217,150,161,223,91,75,16,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
