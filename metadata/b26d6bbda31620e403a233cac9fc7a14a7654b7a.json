Godard discusses his move to a smaller place from Paris, the finances required to make a film and alludes to the relationship between machines and people, bodies as factories and landscapes and the idea that a film studio is a factory in which he is both worker and the boss. During this opening sequence of the film, we are presented with television monitors featuring characters who will return in the main section later on. They remain enigmatic at this stage. The film carries these same nominally contradictory themes to observe the life of the sexuality and economics in a family in a social housing complex in France. The family shares the same preoccupations in more earthy ways: a womanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s body is described as electricity, charging up and decharging. The bodies of the father and the mother are landscapes or factories. Sexual activity is predicated on what happens at work; sex is work. Godard, and later in the story, Sandrine and Pierre, describe these things as not being contradictory, but flowing from one to another through the word ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. For example, a woman is a landscape and a factory, the film is neither political nor pornographic, it is both. Sandrine says: Pleasure is complicated, whereas pain is simple. Finding pleasure in pain or oppression leads to fascism, she states.\n\n____________________________________\n\n\nDVDrip\n\nGeneral / Container Stream #1\nTotal Video Streams for this File.................1\nTotal Audio Streams for this File.................1\nVideo Codecs Used.................................XviD\nAudio Codecs Used.................................MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\nFile Format.......................................AVI\nPlay Time.........................................1h 23mn\nTotal File Size...................................1.01 GiB\nTotal Stream BitRate..............................1 741 Kbps\nVideo Stream #1\nCodec (Human Name)................................MPEG-4 Visual\nCodec (FourCC)....................................XVID\nCodec Profile.....................................Simple@L3\nFrame Width.......................................720 pixels\nFrame Height......................................528 pixels\nFrame Rate........................................25.000 fps\nTotal Frames......................................125126\nDisplay Aspect Ratio..............................4:3\nScan Type.........................................Progressive\nColor Space.......................................YUV\nCodec Settings (Packet BitStream).................No\nQF (like Gordian Knot)............................0.168\nCodec Settings (BVOP).............................No\nCodec Settings (QPel).............................No\nCodec Settings (GMC)..............................No warppoints\nCodec Settings (Matrix)...........................Default (H.263)\nVideo Stream Length...............................1h 23mn 25s 40ms\nVideo Stream BitRate..............................1 600 Kbps\nBit Depth.........................................8 bits\nVideo Stream Size.................................954 MiB (92%)\nVideo Encoder.....................................XviD0046\nAudio Stream #1\nCodec.............................................MPEG Audio\nCodec (FourCC)....................................55\nCodec Profile.....................................Joint stereo\nAudio Stream Length...............................1h 23mn 25s 25ms\nAudio Stream BitRate..............................128 Kbps\nAudio Stream BitRate Mode.........................CBR\nNumber of Audio Channels..........................2\nSampling Rate.....................................48.0 KHz\nAudio Stream Size.................................76.4 MiB (7%)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b26d6bbda31620e403a233cac9fc7a14a7654b7a","amp;dn":"Numero+Deux+AKA+Number+Two+%28Jean-Luc+Godard%2C+1975%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b26d6bbda31620e403a233cac9fc7a14a7654b7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,109,107,189,163,22,32,228,3,162,51,202,201,252,122,20,167,101,75,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
