In the pages of LeonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s novels, the beloved conversations of the Brunetti family have drawn on topics of art and literature, but books are at the heart of this novel in a way they never have been before.\n\nOne afternoon, Commissario Guido Brunetti gets a frantic call from the director of a prestigious Venetian library. Someone has stolen pages out of several rare books. After a round of questioning, the case seems clear: the culprit must be the man who requested the volumes, an American professor from a Kansas university. The only problemÃ¢â‚¬â€the man fled the library earlier that day, and after checking his credentials, the American professor doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exist.\n\nAs the investigation proceeds, the suspects multiply. And when a seemingly harmless theologian, who had spent years reading at the library turns up brutally murdered, Brunetti must question his expectations about what makes a man innocent, or guilty.\n\n[img]http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1392869055l/18467799.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c8dae8954ba0d840f959ac2e26d24239f86e9d2","amp;dn":"By+Its+Cover+by+Donna+Leon+%28Guido+Brunetti+%2323%29+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c8dae8954ba0d840f959ac2e26d24239f86e9d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,141,174,137,84,186,13,132,15,149,154,194,226,109,36,35,159,134,233,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
