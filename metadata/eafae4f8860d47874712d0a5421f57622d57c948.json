Mike outlines the four styles of decision makingÃ¢â‚¬â€autocratic, participatory, democratic, and consensualÃ¢â‚¬â€and reveals which styles are best suited for specific situations. Recognizing that ambiguity is a part of any decision-making process, Mike covers the four types of ambiguity you'll face so that you can recognize what you don't know in order to reduce risk and plan for contingencies. He also presents techniques for involving stakeholders in the decision-making process, and explains how to use a RACI (responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed) matrix. Applying these major concepts will help you make better decisions faster, incur less risk, and gain more support for your decisions.\n\nTopics include:\n\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tChoosing a decision-making style\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tInvolving stakeholders\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tManaging ambiguity and outcomes\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tReducing risk\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tCommunicating and executing decisions\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tMeasuring the results of decisions \n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eafae4f8860d47874712d0a5421f57622d57c948","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Decision-Making+Fundamentals+with+Mike+Figliuolo+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eafae4f8860d47874712d0a5421f57622d57c948","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,250,228,248,134,13,71,135,71,18,208,165,66,31,87,98,45,87,201,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
