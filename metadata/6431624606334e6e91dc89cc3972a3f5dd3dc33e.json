In fact, Jordan Ellenberg shows us, maths touches on everything we do, and a little mathematical knowledge reveals the hidden structures that lie beneath the world's messy and chaotic surface. In How Not to be Wrong, Ellenberg explores the mathematician's method of analyzing life, from the everyday to the cosmic, showing us which numbers to defend, which ones to ignore, and when to change the equation entirely. Along the way, he explains calculus in a single page, describes GÃƒÂ¶del's theorem using only one-syllable words, and reveals how early you actually need to get to the airport.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6431624606334e6e91dc89cc3972a3f5dd3dc33e","amp;dn":"How+Not+to+Be+Wrong%3A+The+Power+of+Mathematical+Thinking","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6431624606334e6e91dc89cc3972a3f5dd3dc33e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,49,98,70,6,51,78,110,145,220,137,204,57,114,163,245,221,61,195,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
