The duo released a similarly titled greatest hits collection 10 years ago: 1992 - 2002. A large number of these tracks were also on the Underworld live album, Everything Everything. And almost all of them turn up again on the second collection, A Collection, which has a coinciding release with Anthology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec1100236f9ef8728e6c031eaf5a757cb4753a27","amp;dn":"Underworld+-+The+Anthology+1992-2012+%283CD%29+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec1100236f9ef8728e6c031eaf5a757cb4753a27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,17,0,35,111,158,248,114,142,108,3,30,175,90,117,124,180,117,58,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
