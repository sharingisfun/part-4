Please could everyone make sure that this request is honoured when making torrents of LC2E.***\n\n***Some folks in here have a nasty habit of spamming my posts with false virus warnings, and would eventually, possibly, try to get me banned from this place. I upload A LOT of material about 9/11 being a staged event, and they seem to trigger a lot of those false virus warnings from users named &quot;b2pilot187&quot; and &quot;transcout&quot; (they're probably the same person). Now, he is obviously either a disinformer or simply just the everyday-idiot, because my files are videofiles, hence impossible to infect with a virus. This user has been reported to the admins of this place, so I hope this matter will be setled sooner rather than later. Until then, simply ignore this person. But I would urge anyone not to ignore a virusscan in any event. I suspect he won't even read this, because he simply searches for &quot;911&quot; (and now &quot;Alex Jones&quot; too) and spam each and every post with these warnings. Hence, you will probably find another one below, in the comment section.***\n\nWhat if:\n\nThe Twin Towers were not hit by commercial airliners? The World Trade Center was brought down in a controlled demolition? The Pentagon was not hit by a 757? Flight 93 was shot down?\n\nWhat if?\n\nThree years after September 11th, the American People are left with more questions than answers. This documentary addresses those questions, as well as providing the evidence necessary to begin answering them. From the phony bin Laden tape to the lack of a 757 at the Pentagon, Loose Change wraps everything up into an hour of solid evidence.\n\nSpecs:\n* You can play these files in any MPG4-compatible (KISS) DVD player, regardless how old it is.\n* You can edit them in any video editor capable of handling .avi files without decompressing the audio first.\n* The framerate is accurate down to the last second (29.970 - NTSC). No audio/video sync problems regardless how much you cut the files.\n\nFrame quality:\nhttp://img2.uploadimages.net/30110901.jpg\nhttp://img2.uploadimages.net/81272002.jpg\n\nName.........: 911 - Loose Change 2nd Edition DVDRip (ConCen) XviD.avi\nFilesize.....: 698 MB (or 715,186 KB or 732,350,464 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:21:51 (147,175 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD 2-pass (DX50, KISS)\nVideo Bitrate: 1057 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) CBR \nFrame Size...: 640x360 (1.78:1) [=16:9]\n\nName.........: 911 - Loose Change 2nd Edition Extra Footage DVDRip (ConCen) XviD.avi\nFilesize.....: 199 MB (or 204,466 KB or 209,373,184 bytes)\nRuntime......: 00:25:18 (45,500 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD 2-pass (DX50, KISS)\nVideo Bitrate: 968 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) CBR \nFrame Size...: 640x360 (1.78:1) [=16:9]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:280c91b639b3e960bbcd3fad09391398177d04c7","amp;dn":"911+-+Loose+Change+2nd+Edition+Incl.+Extras+DVDRip+%28READ+COMMENT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"280c91b639b3e960bbcd3fad09391398177d04c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,12,145,182,57,179,233,96,187,205,63,173,9,57,19,152,23,125,4,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
