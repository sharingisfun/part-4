These controls are frequently bypassed when the humans themselves are compromised by a social engineering attack.\r\n\r\nSocial engineering involves compromising the individuals that use these systems. Attackers look to exploit weaknesses in human nature and coerce people into performing actions which give the attacker an advantage. In this course, we'll look at various different social engineering techniques that can be used to compromise systems. We'll also look at both computer-based and behavior-based tools to help defend against this risk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:678327ea7cd871f98c581c703c7245a06fb44458","amp;dn":"Ethical+Hacking%3A+Social+Engineering+-+Video+Course+-+Pluralsight","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"678327ea7cd871f98c581c703c7245a06fb44458","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,131,39,234,124,216,113,249,140,88,28,112,60,114,69,160,111,180,68,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
