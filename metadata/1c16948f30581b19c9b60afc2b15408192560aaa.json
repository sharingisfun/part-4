Both Most and Mainieri (who also did most of the group s writing) are abundantly inventive soloists, while the buoyantly effective rhythm section is a Rich archetype. With the leader keeping the drum solos within reasonable limits mostly breathtakingly brilliant four or eights, and passages ingeniously integrated with the rhythmic patterns of the ensemble this is one of his tightest small groups.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c16948f30581b19c9b60afc2b15408192560aaa","amp;dn":"Buddy+Rich+-+Playtime+1960","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c16948f30581b19c9b60afc2b15408192560aaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,22,148,143,48,88,27,25,201,182,10,252,43,21,64,129,146,86,10,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
