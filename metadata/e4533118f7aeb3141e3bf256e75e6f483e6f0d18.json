It follows his acclaimed Older Than My Old Man Now album from 2012Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬Å“my death nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ decay opus,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as Wainwright calls it. Due for release on the 28th July, the new album sees Loudon broadening his scope with a 14-song, genre-bounding set (Ã¢â‚¬Å“eclectricity,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he calls it) dealing with varied subject matter including depression, drinking, senior citizenship, gun control, heartbreak, pet ownership and New York CityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arcane practice of alternate side-of-the-street parking.\n\nUproariously rocking lead track Ã¢â‚¬ËœBrand New DanceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, which evokes The Big BopperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic Ã¢â‚¬ËœChantilly LaceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, is Ã¢â‚¬Å“me moaning and groaning about the horror and embarrassment of personal physical diminishment in the wider context of the world in which we live today,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Wainwright states. Continuing this theme, Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe MorgueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, which Judd Apatow originally commissioned for WainwrightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dysfunctional dad character to sing to Adam Sandler in an episode of Undeclared, finds Ã¢â‚¬Å“death and decay meeting shit love,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he says.\n\nLikewise, Ã¢â‚¬ËœHarlan CountyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was written as a theme song for the TV show Justified, and also like Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe MorgueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, was rejected. WainwrightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s version on HGTB(Y), however, features the beautiful vocal harmonies of singer-songwriter Aoife OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Donovan. The backup vocals of WainwrightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter Martha, meanwhile, appropriately grace Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Knew Your Mother.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nOther cuts of special Wainwright interest include Ã¢â‚¬ËœMan &amp; DogÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, which was motivated by his dog Harry (the inspiration of other Wainwright ditties, including, he says, his yet-to-be-recorded Ã¢â‚¬ËœPuppy HateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢), and Ã¢â‚¬ËœSpacedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, a klezmer/Balkan gypsy-styled look at that alternate street parking theme. He takes a typically topical turn on Ã¢â‚¬ËœGod &amp; NatureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Ã¢â‚¬Å“A bit of Episcopalian gospel composed after watching the 2012 Vice Presidential DebatesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and his new seasonal favorite, Ã¢â‚¬ËœIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Be Killing You This ChristmasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, which he actually wrote in response to the Newtown shootings.\n\nWainwright notes that he toyed with the idea of calling the album Town &amp; Country, then saw the cover photo of the famous forlorn clown Emmet Kelly, after which Ã¢â‚¬Å“HavenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Got the Blues (Yet)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ became the title track. Another standout track, Ã¢â‚¬ËœDepression BluesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, invokes such great blues men as Blind Lemon Jefferson and Sleepy John Estes, not to mention Shakespeare and Ã¢â‚¬Å“old Sigmund.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nProducing HGTB(Y) was WainwrightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long time musical collaborator David Mansfield, who has backed him on numerous previous recordings as instrumentalist/arranger, including the 2010 Grammy Award winning High Wide &amp; Handsome-The Charlie Poole Project. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I got to know LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢il Davey about 23 years ago, on a flight back from Vancouver Ã¢â‚¬â€ I think Ã¢â‚¬â€ to New York,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Wainwright recalls. Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve worked on and off with him ever since, on TV, in the recording studio, and on the road. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been featured as a player and arranger on some of my best records including History, Grown Man, Last Man on Earth, and High Wide &amp; Handsome.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Other top players grace HGTB(Y), and include ace banjoist Tony Trischka, saxophonist Steve Elson, drummer Sammy Merendino, bassist Tim Luntzel, and another longtime musical cohort, Chaim Tannenbaum, on background vocals.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4533118f7aeb3141e3bf256e75e6f483e6f0d18","amp;dn":"Loudon+Wainwright+III+-+Haven%27t+Got+The+Blues+Yet+%282014%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4533118f7aeb3141e3bf256e75e6f483e6f0d18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,83,49,24,247,174,179,20,30,59,242,86,231,94,111,72,62,111,13,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
