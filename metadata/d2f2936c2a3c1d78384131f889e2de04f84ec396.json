You may be an artist who has learned 3D tools such as 3ds Max, Maya, or Cinema 4D, or you may come from 2D tools such as Photoshop and Illustrator. On the other hand, you may just want to familiarize yourself with programming games and the latest ideas in game production. \n\nThis book introduces key game production concepts in an artist-friendly way, and rapidly teaches the basic scripting skills you'll need with Unity. It goes on to show how you, as an independent game artist, can create casual interactive adventure games in the style of Telltale's Tales of Monkey Island, while also giving you a firm foundation in game logic and design. \n\nThe first part of the book explains the logic involved in game interaction, and soon has you creating game assets through simple examples that you can build upon and gradually expand.\nIn the second part, you'll build the foundations of a point-and-click style first-person adventure gameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including reusable state management scripts, load/save functionality, a robust inventory system, and a bonus feature: a dynamically configured maze and mini-map.\nWith the help of the provided 2D and 3D content, you'll learn to evaluate and deal with challenges in bite-sized pieces as the project progresses, gaining valuable problem-solving skills in interactive design.\nBy the end of the book, you will be able to actively use the Unity 3D game engine, having learned the necessary workflows to utilize your own assets. You will also have an assortment of reusable scripts and art assets with which to build future games.\nWhat youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn\nHow to build interactive games that work on a variety of platforms\nTake the tour around Unity user interface fundamentals, scripting and more\nCreate a test environment and gain control over functionality, cursor control, action objects, state management, object metadata, message text and more\nWhat is inventory logic and how to manage it\nHow to handle 3D object visibility, effects and other special cases\nHow to handle variety of menus and levels in your games development\nHow to handle characters, scrollers, and more\nHow to create or integrate a story/walkthrough\nWho this book is for\nStudents or artists familiar with tools such as 3ds Max or Maya who want to create games for mobile platforms, computers, or consoles, but with little or no experience in scripting or the logic behind games development.\n\nTable of Contents\nExploring the Genre\nUnity UIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Basics and Getting Started\nScriptingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Getting your Feet Wet\nTerrain GenerationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Creating a Test Environment\nNavigation and Introduction to Functionality\nCursor Control\nAction Objects\nManaging State\nObject Metadata\nMessage Text\nInventory Logic\nManaging the Inventory\nFinishing the Basic Functionality\nGetting Down to the Game\nMaze and Final Sequence\nMenus and Levels\nBeyond the Basics\nAppendix A: Shader Graphs\nAppendix B: Keyboard Key Names\nAppendix C: Final Sequence Outline\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2f2936c2a3c1d78384131f889e2de04f84ec396","amp;dn":"Begginning+3D+Game+Development+With+Unity+%5Bpdf%5D+Karaty+chicken","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2f2936c2a3c1d78384131f889e2de04f84ec396","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,242,147,108,42,60,29,120,56,65,49,248,137,226,222,4,248,78,195,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
