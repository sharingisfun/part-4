All three films are quite intriguing and very much worth watching. (Los Muertos is my personal favorite because it seems to flow most naturally, almost magically, like the river where it takes place; but I've come across an interview in which Alonso speaks of La Libertad as a more challenging and, in his view, more successful project.)\n\nThroughout the trilogy, the Argentinean director/screenwriter manages to inspire in the audience a true sense of awe and mystery while working with very few, beautifully simple ideas; it is precisely the economic and lean nature of the &quot;storytelling&quot; (if one may call it this) that's most captivating.\n\nIn La Libertad, the camera appears to document a day in the life of a woodsman who survives in a state of near-complete isolation. (Curiously enough, the filmmaker has described the story as being not so much about a lumberjack, but about a person watching that lumberjack from a cinema - a concept which is later touched upon in Fantasma, the third part of the trilogy.)\n\n   General\n      Complete name : La Libertad.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 693 MiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 9mn\n      Bit rate : 1381 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 9.20 MiB\n      Writing application : MEncoder dev-CVS-060307-04:23-4.0.1\n      Writing library : MPlayer\n   Video #0\n      Codec : DivX 4\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : Project Mayo DivX 4\n      Codec profile : Simple Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : No\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 9mn\n      Bit rate : 1247 Kbps\n      Width : 560 pixels\n      Height : 320 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 16/9\n      Frame rate : 29.970 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.231\n      StreamSize : 621 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 9mn\n      Bit rate : 125 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 62.4 MiB\n      Writing library : Xing (new)\n\nIMDB: tt0291310\n\nSpanish audio, English and Portuguese subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c13450cbbff5e7dc4668f3bac200f58d09d2ab95","amp;dn":"La+Libertad+%282001%29+-+Lisandro+Alonso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c13450cbbff5e7dc4668f3bac200f58d09d2ab95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,52,80,203,191,245,231,220,70,104,243,186,194,0,245,141,9,210,171,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
