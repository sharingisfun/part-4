There are no forms, simply developmental exercises taken from the arts mentioned previously, partner drills, and fighting. This is the first DVD in the Aunkai instructional set. I have also included as many articles as I can in PDF format (if you don't want to use Adobe Reader there are alternatives such as SumatraPDF or Foxit Reader). I do not have any more of the DVDs, please support the art and check out their site. This is the first in a series of three DVDs. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.aunkai.net/eng/shop/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.aunkai.net/eng/shop/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\nThis is a great development tool particularly for aikidoka trying to develop some of the more esoteric skills that Morihei Ueshiba was able to exhibit or for taiji players whose instructors can only teach the external. Remember, it takes years to develop these skills properly and your duty is to analyze your body as much as possible when practicing and then to test it in partner drills and fighting. Self-correction is very difficult and unfortunately there are not many study groups for this art yet as it is incredibly modern and very demanding. I hope you enjoy this.\n-GTW","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ac449ffcf12e4cb9fda734891f058b6e50c29e6","amp;dn":"Martial+Arts+Aunkai+DVD+1+Solo+Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ac449ffcf12e4cb9fda734891f058b6e50c29e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,196,73,255,207,18,228,203,159,218,115,72,145,240,88,182,229,12,41,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
