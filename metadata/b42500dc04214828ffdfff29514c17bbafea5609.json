Ou comment l&amp;#039;amour ne fait qu&amp;#039;un avec l&amp;#039;expÃƒÂ©rience de la transformation.\n\nA magnificent movie!, 24 February 2007\n\nAuthor: vidopier from France \n\nI think DH Lawrence would be proud of this film...Pascale Ferran transformed this story we all imagine as an erotic clichÃƒÂ© in a very sensible and sensitive movie. Because Lady Chatterley is not the story of a more or less sex-addict bourgeoise we have seen in so many rubbish erotic movies, inspired by the novel. It is much more about a woman who discovers the materiality of world threw a love story. She discovers also that &quot;some people are not naturally made to command others&quot; and in a way her love story with Parkin is a truly waking up to other people and life around her. She discovers her body and the world of the first industrial revolution has it used to be: unfair and unequal. Lady Chatterlay is not only an erotic story but also a very politic and subversive one. DH Lawrence is well known for being very critical about the British society of 1920&amp;#039;s and the human side-effects of industrial development. Pascal Ferran perfectly understood the deep meaning of the novel. Moreover, she transmuted those ideas in a very french movie (but in fact the best french author cinema). The way she has filmed the two characters is very intimate but never silly, and that&amp;#039;s a great achievement! In a way, her style is very closed to Piala&amp;#039;s one. Harsh and poetic at the same time, precise and evocative, sensible and sensitive. This film is very precious!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b42500dc04214828ffdfff29514c17bbafea5609","amp;dn":"Lady+Chatterley+French+dvdrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b42500dc04214828ffdfff29514c17bbafea5609","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,37,0,220,4,33,72,40,255,223,255,41,81,76,23,187,175,234,86,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
