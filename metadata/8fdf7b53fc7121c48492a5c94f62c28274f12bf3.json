Recorded at St. Charles in Nashville, Tennessee and produced by Jay Joyce, the album was released on October 8, 2013 through RCA Records.\n\nFor Melophobia, Cage the Elephant attempted to distance themselves from comparisons of the sound that influenced them, shutting themselves off from as much recorded music as possible. Melophobia means &quot;fear of music&quot;; the band did not view the term literally, but rather thought of the term as &quot;a fear of creating music to project premeditated images of self, like catering to cool, or making music to project an image of being intellectual or artistic or poetic, rather than just trying to be an honest communicator.&quot;\n\nFrontman Matthew Schultz viewed the record as a battle &quot;to remain transparent and to remain honest.&quot; His friend, Tiger Merritt of Morning Teleportation, told him that &quot;if you're not slightly embarrassed to sing the lyrics, you're probably not writing a good song,&quot; and encouraged him to refrain from attempting to write poetically but rather naturally. When writing new tracks, Schultz would often doodle an image alongside his lyrics for visual reference.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/PbIzLpm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/PbIzLpm.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fdf7b53fc7121c48492a5c94f62c28274f12bf3","amp;dn":"Cage+the+Elephant+-+Melophobia+%5B2013%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fdf7b53fc7121c48492a5c94f62c28274f12bf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,223,123,83,252,113,33,196,132,146,165,201,79,98,194,130,116,241,43,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
