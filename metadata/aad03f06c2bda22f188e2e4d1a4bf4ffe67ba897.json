In the groundbreaking book, The Great Cholesterol Myth, Jonny Bowden and Stephen Sinatra debunked that assertion, arguing that fat--often curtailed on traditional low cholesterol &quot;heart-healthy&quot; diets--is not the enemy and may in fact be part of the solution.\n\nNow, in The Great Cholesterol Myth Cookbook, the authors and nutrition expert and whole foods chef Deirdre Rawlings, Ph.D., put their findings into action with a detailed meal plan and 100 delicious and nutritious recipes that will prevent and reverse heart disease and give you back the foods you thought were gone forever.\n\n* Learn how to live a life free of heart disease without the use of harmful statin drugs.\n* Based on the latest studies, discover why sugar (not fat), inflammation, stress, and high-carb diets full of processed foods are the true culprits of heart disease.\n* Combat heart disease with 100 mouthwatering recipes designed to satisfy your taste buds, provide key nutrients, and keep your heart healthy.\n\nRecipes included:\n\n* Veal Scaloppini Supreme\n* Luscious Lemon Yogurt Cake\n* Anti-Inflammatory Turmeric Turkey Burgers\n* Soul Warming Tuna Lasagna\n* Fortifying Flourless Chicken Flapjacks\n* Hearty Mediterranean Frittata\n* Energizing Thai Spice Chicken Salad\n* Gluten-Free Mediterranean Veggie Pizza\n* Protein-Packed Vegetarian Shepherd's Pie\n* Sweet and Spicy Beef or Chicken Stir Fry\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReviews:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&quot;...The Great Cholesterol Myth Cookbook busts unscientific food myths--so you can get back to the joy of eating!&quot;\n--Jacob Teitelbaum, M.D., author of Beat Sugar Addiction Now!\n\n&quot;You owe it to yourself, your heart, and your family to read this book, but more importantly, follow the program!&quot;\n--Robb Wolf, best-selling author of The Paleo Solution\n\n&quot;What a delight to find that all these Ã¢â‚¬Ëœforbidden' foods are exactly what we should be eating to keep our hearts healthy!&quot;\n--Ann Louise Gittleman, Ph.D, C.N.S., best-selling author, The Fat Flush Plan\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the Author/s:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJonny Bowden, Ph.D., C.N.S., is a nationally known expert on weight loss, nutrition, and health.
