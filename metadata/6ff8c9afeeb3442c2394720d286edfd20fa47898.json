By the time I was less than one third through, I was driven to distraction by the overwhelming number of times the word &quot;sadly&quot; was used. Talk about overkill! &quot;So-and-so climbed up to the fiftieth floor and sadly leapt to her death.&quot; &quot;Mr. Movie Star shot himself in the head and sadly he died.&quot; &quot;Sadly, the child was never found again.&quot; &quot;Miss Film Star married sixty two times and sadly passed away in her sleep.&quot; Sadly, sadly, sadly, sadly. It got sooo tedious! Aside from the endlessly repeating &quot;sadlys&quot;, the writing wasn't bad, and I enjoyed the book. Yeah, I'd still recommend it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ff8c9afeeb3442c2394720d286edfd20fa47898","amp;dn":"The+Mammoth+Book+of+Hollywood+Scandals+-+Michelle+Morgan+-+Mante","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ff8c9afeeb3442c2394720d286edfd20fa47898","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,248,201,175,238,179,68,44,35,148,114,13,40,110,223,210,15,164,120,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
