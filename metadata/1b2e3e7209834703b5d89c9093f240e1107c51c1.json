Electronic and instrumental reprises precede songs they've yet to play, and Dr. Seuss becomes lyrical motivation for bold futuristic visions. Granduciel has done it again, better than before: Slave Ambient, their proper second album, is a brilliant 47 minute sprawl of rock n roll, conceptualized with a sense of adventure and captured with seasons of bravado.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b2e3e7209834703b5d89c9093f240e1107c51c1","amp;dn":"The+War+On+Drugs+-+2011+-+Slave+Ambient","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b2e3e7209834703b5d89c9093f240e1107c51c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,46,62,114,9,131,71,3,181,216,156,144,147,242,64,225,16,124,81,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
