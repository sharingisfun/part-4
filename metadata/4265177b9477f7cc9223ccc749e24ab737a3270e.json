The Greeks wanted to \n\nturn their country into a piÃƒÂ±ata stuffed with cash and allow as many citizens as \n\npossible to take a whack at it. The Germans wanted to be even more German; the Irish \n\nwanted to stop being Irish. \n \nMichael Lewis's investigation of bubbles beyond our shores is so brilliantly, sadly \n\nhilarious that it leads the American reader to a comfortable complacency: oh, those \n\nfoolish foreigners. But when he turns a merciless eye on California and Washington, \n\nDC, we see that the narrative is a trap baited with humor, and we understand the \n\nreckoning that awaits the greatest and greediest of debtor nations.\n  \n \n \n \n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4265177b9477f7cc9223ccc749e24ab737a3270e","amp;dn":"Boomerang+-+Travels+in+the+New+Third+World+BY+Michael+Lewis-+201","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4265177b9477f7cc9223ccc749e24ab737a3270e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,101,23,123,148,119,247,204,146,35,204,199,73,226,74,183,55,163,39,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
