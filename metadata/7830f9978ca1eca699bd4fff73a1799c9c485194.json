Echoing the spirit of America after WWII, these characters have lost their identity and thier hope, and are finding it rough going until redeemed by a lovely, good-hearted woman.\n\n\n*******\n\nPlease seed this at least as much as you download. Thank you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7830f9978ca1eca699bd4fff73a1799c9c485194","amp;dn":"Somewhere+in+the+Night+%281946+film+noir%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7830f9978ca1eca699bd4fff73a1799c9c485194","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,48,249,151,140,161,236,166,153,189,79,255,115,161,121,156,156,72,81,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
