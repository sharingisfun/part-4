It's great creating maps, analyzing data for land use studies and other reports, and preparing data for use in an application or database. Let Adam Wilbert show you how to display, analyze, and illustrate geospatial data with ArcGIS. He explores how to import data from multiple sources, manage it with the ArcGIS catalog, and then start making maps. Learn how to lay out your data in the ArcMap component; add symbols, scale bars, and legends; and get your maps out of ArcGIS and into the real world, whether it's for printing or export to another application.\nTopics include:\nUnderstanding vector vs. raster data\nModifying metadata\nAdding data to a map\nImporting data from online providers\nLabeling features\nJoining data\nClipping data to a study area\nWorking with map layouts\nCreating a legend\nPrinting and exporting the map to a file","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:071e43f03eb16a4b384fd1afa16c838a5782534c","amp;dn":"Lynda.com_Up+and+Running+with+ArcGIS+by+Adam.Wilbert","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"071e43f03eb16a4b384fd1afa16c838a5782534c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,30,67,240,62,177,106,75,56,79,209,175,161,108,131,138,87,130,83,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
