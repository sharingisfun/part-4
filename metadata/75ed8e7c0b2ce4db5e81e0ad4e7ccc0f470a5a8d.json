As is the case with much of Fela's work, the album \nmakes criticism of the lack of basic necessities for African citizens, despite a wealth at the time from oil deposits, \nand the lyrics here address the political injustices of Nigeria at the time, satirizing public officials while \ncommanding the people to get up/stand up. But the real revolutionary tenor of this music comes through in its sprawling \ngrooves, whether on the relentlessly driving &quot;Original Suffer Head,&quot; the chill, jazzy &quot;Power Show,&quot; or the roiling, \npolyphonal &quot;I.T.T. Pt. 1 &amp; 2.&quot; I.T.T. (International Telephone and Telegraph) is a direct attack upon the president of \nNigeria and the head of I.T.T. It was clear attack on the corruption of these high level officials whp were in collusion \nwith foreign business and exploiting the average Nigerian.\n\nPersonnel includes: \nFela Kuti (vocals, tenor saxophone, piano); \nLekan Animashaun (leader, baritone saxophone); \nTunde Brown (guitar);\nAkwete Owona (bass Guitar) \nYomi Ogundipe, Okalue Ojeah (tenor guitar)\nKiala Ngala (rhythm guitar) \nNana Femi Ankulapo Kuti (alto saxophone); \nAdeniran Oyinade (tenor saxophone); \nAcheampong Kola Oni, (baritone saxophone); \nOtenioro Olu-Ifayeun, Oye Shobowale (trumpet); \nOye Sosowale (flugelhorn); \nDurotimi Ikujenyo, Dele Shosimi (rhythm piano); \nNicholas Avom, Masefswe Anam (drums); \nEssiet Udoh, Dele Osho (congas).\nAlele Adamu (percussion-sticks)\nAlake Anikulapo-Kuti, Fehintola Anikulapo-Kuti, \nIhase Anikulapo-Kuti, Ronke Anikunifa, \nSewanu Akran (vocals)\n\n1- ORIGINAL SUFFER HEAD     21,09\n2- POWER SHOW     14,47\n3- I.T.T.     24,02\n\nFormat: MPEG Audio\nFormat version: Version 1\nFormat profile: Layer 3\nMode: Joint stereo\nBit rate mode: Constant\nBit rate: 128kbps\nChannel(s): 2 channels\nSampling rate: 44.1KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75ed8e7c0b2ce4db5e81e0ad4e7ccc0f470a5a8d","amp;dn":"Fela+Anikulapo+Kuti+-+Original+Suffer+Head+%5BMp3+128%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75ed8e7c0b2ce4db5e81e0ad4e7ccc0f470a5a8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,237,142,124,11,44,228,219,94,129,224,173,78,124,204,15,71,10,90,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
