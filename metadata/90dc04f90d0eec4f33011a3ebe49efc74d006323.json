It includes 50 custom amp and cab simulated tones, all of which were personally designed by the guitarists themselves.\n\nThis collection paints a broad picture of modern metal guitar of today. Find the soaring, saturated leads, the pummeling rhythm tones and all the tight semi-clean, ambient and effect soaked tones youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need for any spur-of-the-moment creativity.\n\nThis collection is a speed-dial to the tones you hear on albums and that the artists use themselves in their own recording and creative processes. You too can sound like a god.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nOur greets go to all hard working groups. \nAnd middle finger to the people who make money with our effort. \n\nSupport the good developer if you like it. \nWe would like to support you for free as long as you understand \nwhat you are doing and what it means. \n\nREVERSE 2 REVOLUTiONiZE \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1337x.to - demonoid.pw - isohunt.to - kickass.so - flashtorrents.org\nbtdigg.org -\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXIV (12)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90dc04f90d0eec4f33011a3ebe49efc74d006323","amp;dn":"Toontrack+EMX+Metal+Guitar+Gods+2+v1.0.0+OS+X+%5BR2R%5D%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90dc04f90d0eec4f33011a3ebe49efc74d006323","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,220,4,249,13,14,236,79,51,1,26,62,190,73,239,199,77,0,99,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
