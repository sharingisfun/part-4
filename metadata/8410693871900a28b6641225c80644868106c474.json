The group is prehaps best known for hit 80s rock singles such as &quot;Round and Round&quot; and &quot;Lay It Down&quot;, tracks that ranked on Billboard's top 40 at #12 and #40, respectively, as well as other songs such as &quot;Wanted Man&quot;, &quot;Way Cool Jr.&quot; and &quot;Lovin' You's A Dirty Job&quot;. Ratt has been recognized as instrumental in the formation of the early 1980s, Los Angeles glam metal scene, promoting what's known as the 'Sunset Strip' sound of pop hooks infused into an aggressive metal ethos along with groups such as friendly rivals MÃƒÂ¶tley CrÃƒÂ¼e.\n\nThe band continues to tour and record today despite extended hiatuses and line-up changes. They released their latest studio album, Infestation, on April 20, 2010. They are currently working on their next studio album.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOut of the Cellar is the debut studio album by heavy metal band Ratt. Released in 1984, it is currently certified as triple platinum by the RIAA.\n\nProduced by Beau Hill, Out of the Cellar features Ratt's best-known hit, &quot;Round and Round&quot;. It also contains other singles that performed well on the charts, such as &quot;Wanted Man&quot;, &quot;Lack of Communication&quot; and a re-recorded version of &quot;Back for More&quot;. The latter song originally appeared on the Ratt EP. &quot;In Your Direction&quot; was a song that Pearcy wrote and had since Mickey Ratt; &quot;I'm Insane&quot; and &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot; were songs Crosby had co-written and performed with his pre-Ratt band, Mac Meda, featuring future Riverdogs vocalist Rob Lamothe. In 2008, &quot;Round and Round&quot; and &quot;I'm Insane&quot; were featured in The Wrestler.\n\nWanted Man was co-written by bassist Joey Cristofanilli. Cristofanilli briefly substituted for Juan Croucier, who was also a member of Dokken at the time.\n\nThe model on the album cover is Tawny Kitaen, better known for her appearances in Whitesnake music videos, and the same year's teen-aimed film Bachelor Party. As she was the long-time girlfriend to guitarist Robbin Crosby at that time, Kitaen also appeared in the &quot;Back For More&quot; music video.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInvasion of Your Privacy is the second album by American heavy metal band Ratt. It was released in 1985 and featured the singles &quot;Lay It Down&quot;, &quot;You're in Love&quot; and &quot;What You Give Is What You Get&quot;. Beau Hill produced the album, and the cover-model is Playboy model Marianne Gravatte, who also made an appearance in the &quot;Lay It Down&quot; music video.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDancing Undercover is Ratt's third full length album. It was produced by Beau Hill. The album contained the hit single/video &quot;Dance&quot;, as well as &quot;Body Talk&quot;, which was used on the soundtrack for Eddie Murphy's film, The Golden Child, and the third release, &quot;Slip of the Lip&quot;. It charted at #26 on Billboard's Album Chart and #14 on Rolling Stone's Album Chart. The album is certified Platinum.\n\nOpening acts on this tour included Poison, Cinderella, QueensrÃƒÂ¿che and Vinnie Vincent Invasion.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReach for the Sky is the fourth full length album by the glam metal band Ratt.\n\nThough it sold well enough to achieve platinum status and spawned the popular songs &quot;I Want a Woman&quot; and &quot;Way Cool Jr.&quot;, the record's performance was not enough to keep the group on the road for longer than seven months. As a result, &quot;What's It Gonna Be&quot;, a track not released as a single, was used as a B-Side to &quot;Lovin' You's a Dirty Job&quot;, the first single from the band's next release Detonator. In doing so, it was hoped that listeners would go back and give Reach for the Sky a second listen.\n\nReach for the Sky marked the last Ratt album to be produced by Beau Hill. The band originally intended for the record to be produced entirely by Mike &quot;Clay&quot; Stone. However, substandard DAT tape recordings of Stone's production efforts prompted Atlantic Records to bring in Hill to assist Stone and salvage the album.\n\nOpening acts on the promotional record tour included Warrant and Kix.\n\nPro-wrestler Brian Pillman used &quot;Don't Bite The Hand That Feeds&quot; as his theme music, when WCW talent went on tour with New Japan Pro Wrestling.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDetonator is Ratt's fifth studio album, released in August 1990.\n\nThough their previous album, Reach for the Sky, went platinum, it met with some criticism regarding the quality of their songs. In an attempt to regain the popularity that Ratt had in the mid-1980s, the band parted ways with long-time producer Beau Hill. Hitmaker Desmond Child and his personal sound engineer Sir Arthur Payson were hired to helm the project.\n\nThis is the last album to feature guitarist Robbin &quot;The King&quot; Crosby before his departure in 1991, after the Japanese leg of the Detonator Tour.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBand:\n\n\nStephen Pearcy: lead vocals\n\nWarren DeMartini: lead &amp; rhythm guitars\n\nRobbin Crosby: lead &amp; rhythm guitars\n\nJuan Croucier: bass guitar\n\nBobby Blotzer: drums, percussion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8410693871900a28b6641225c80644868106c474","amp;dn":"Ratt+-+Original+Album+Series+%5B5+CD%27s%5D%5B2013%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8410693871900a28b6641225c80644868106c474","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,16,105,56,113,144,10,40,182,100,18,37,200,6,68,134,129,6,196,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
