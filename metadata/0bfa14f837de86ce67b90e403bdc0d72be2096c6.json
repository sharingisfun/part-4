Co-written with bestselling novelist and Stoker Award finalist Jay Bonansinga, the books thrust readers right into the middle of the greatest zombie apocalypse epic ever told.   \n\nThe first volume, THE WALKING DEAD: RISE OF THE GOVERNOR, explores the heart-wrenching and horrifying origin of the comic worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most infamous villain: Philip Blake, AKA The Governor.  Following Blake and his ragtag band of survivors as they carve out a terrifying path through infested subdivisions and rotting cities, RISE OF THE GOVERNOR is a fever dream of a road trip that explores the making of a super-villain, culminating in a mind-bending twist-ending. \n\nThe second volume in the series, THE WALKING DEAD: THE ROAD TO WOODBURY, delves even deeper into the dark heart of the Governor, taking readers through the fractured looking glass of a small town turned into a deadly dictatorship. As seen through the eyes of a troubled bystander, Lilly Caul, this rotting utopia crumbles under the weight of its own excesses and lurid pastimes. \n\nThe third and fourth installment, THE WALKING DEAD: FALL OF THE GOVERNOR, ties all the narrative strands and back-stories together in a roller coaster finale that spans two books -- an epic conclusion that resonates for fans of the comic series in startling ways.  Every dark promise made during the Governor's rise to power now pays off in a series of terrifying, dramatic confrontations.  When collected as a set, these four installments tell a heart-wrenching and terrifying saga of apocalyptic horror as well as human behavior in the extreme.\n\nThe fifth installment written by Jay Bonansinga, based on the original series created by Robert Kirkman, The Walking Dead: Descent follows the events of The Fall of the Governor, and Lilly CaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s struggles to rebuild Woodbury after the GovernorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shocking demise.\n\nOut of the ashes of its dark past, Woodbury, Georgia, becomes an oasis of safety amidst the plague of the walking dead Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a town reborn in the wake of its former tyrannical leader, Philip Blake, aka The Governor.\n\nBlakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legacy of madness haunts every nook and cranny of this little walled community, but Lilly Caul and a small ragtag band of survivors are determined to overcome their traumatic pastÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ despite the fact that a super-herd is closing in on them.\n\nThis vast stampede of zombies, driven by inexorable hunger and aimed directly at Woodbury, becomes their first true test. But Lilly and company refuse to succumb, and in a stunning counteroffensive, the beleaguered townspeople save themselves by joining forces with a mysterious religious sect fresh from the wilderness.\n\nLed by an enigmatic preacher named Jeremiah, this rogue church group seems tailor made for Woodbury and LillyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dream of a democratic, family-friendly future. The two factions meld into one, the town prospers, and everything seems hopeful for the first time since the plague broke out.\n \nBut things Ã¢â‚¬â€œ especially in the world of the walking dead Ã¢â‚¬â€œ are often not what they seem","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bfa14f837de86ce67b90e403bdc0d72be2096c6","amp;dn":"The+Walking+Dead+Novels+1-5+Complete+to+Date","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bfa14f837de86ce67b90e403bdc0d72be2096c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,250,20,248,55,222,134,206,103,185,14,64,59,220,13,114,190,32,150,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
