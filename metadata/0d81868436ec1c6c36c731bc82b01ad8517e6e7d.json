It is well suited for undergraduate students in physics, mathematics, electronic engineering as well as for scientists in research and development. It gives illustrations and recommendations when using existing Fourier programs and thus helps to avoid frustrations. Moreover, it is entertaining and you will learn a lot unconsciously. Fourier series as well as continuous and discrete Fourier transformation are discussed with particular emphasis on window functions. Filter effects of digital data processing are illustrated. Two new chapters are devoted to modern applications. The first deals with data streams and fractional delays and the second with the back-projection of filtered projections in tomography. There are many figures and mostly easy to solve exercises with solutions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d81868436ec1c6c36c731bc82b01ad8517e6e7d","amp;dn":"Fourier+Transformation+for+Pedestrians%2C+2nd+Edition+%5B2015%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d81868436ec1c6c36c731bc82b01ad8517e6e7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,129,134,132,54,236,28,108,54,199,49,188,130,176,26,216,81,126,110,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
