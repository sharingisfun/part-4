He takes it back to his people, and they use it for many tasks. The people start to fight over it, so he decides to return it to the God--where he thinks it came from. Meanwhile, we are introduced to a school teacher assigned to a small village, a despotic revolutionary, and a clumsy biologist.\n\n\n\n2 - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097443/ - The Gods Must Be Crazy II (1989)\n\nXixo is back again. This time, his children accidentally stow away on a fast-moving poachers&amp;#039; truck, unable to get off, and Xixo sets out to rescue them.
