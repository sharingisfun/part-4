It is loaded with audio samples to provide you with unending \n\ncreative content. Some of the categories include Aircraft, Automobiles, Crashes, \n\nExplosions, Horror, and my personal favorite Weapons. Also, I couldn't resist \n\nadding an extra folder that I put together and edited myself with some help \n\nfrom &quot;Battery&quot; and &quot;Sound Forge&quot;. I call it &quot;Weapons  and  Mass Destruction&quot;. So, \n\nactually it is a bit closer to 1,040 sound effects. Size is approximately 380mbs \n\n(unrared)\n\n\nCheck out my other torrents on TPB by left clicking on my name.\n\n\nENJOY!\n\n\nThanks to those of you who show their support by seeding this torrent.\n\n\nPlease take a moment to leave a comment while waiting for your download.\n\n\n\nXeno\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb1643a0775f3cc1f912207551dcf5cab3bb3bd3","amp;dn":"Sony+Sound+FX%2B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb1643a0775f3cc1f912207551dcf5cab3bb3bd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,22,67,160,119,95,60,193,249,18,32,117,81,220,245,202,179,187,59,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
