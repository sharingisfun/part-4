All the familiar narratives are here, along with some less familiar characters and motifs. In addition to the tales, the book explains key issues arising from the narratives, and discusses the myths and their wider relevance.This long-overdue book crystallises three key areas of interest: the nature of the tales; the stories themselves; and how they have and might be interpreted. For the first time, it brings together aspects of Greek mythology only usually available in disparate forms - namely children's books and academic works. There will be much here that is interesting, surprising, and strange as well as familiar. Experts and non-experts, adults, students and schoolchildren alike will gain entertainment and insight from this fascinating and important volume","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cd110dcf28764262c67b55df58a2822450ebeb2","amp;dn":"A+Brief+Guide+to+the+Greek+Myths","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cd110dcf28764262c67b55df58a2822450ebeb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,209,16,220,242,135,100,38,44,103,181,93,245,138,40,34,69,14,190,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
