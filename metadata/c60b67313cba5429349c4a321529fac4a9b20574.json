Some superb musicians are included, and I especially like &quot;Detni Essekra&quot;, which reminds me of a tango, with its emphasis on piano (Boyan Zulfikapasic), stringbass (Bernard Paganotti) and accordion (Philippe Eidel). &quot;Ki Kounti&quot; is another gem; recorded in Los Angeles, it is a duet with Saul Hernandez, composer and lead singer for Mexico&amp;#039;s well known rock band Jaguares, and is sung partially in Spanish. Three tracks were recorded in Jamaica, and have a marvelous bouncy reggae feel to them: &quot;Lillah&quot; has a terrific brass accompaniment, &quot;Ouelli El Darek&quot; nifty background vocals by the &quot;I Threes&quot;, and &quot;Mektoubi&quot; is an all-out big band number. My two favorites would be &quot;Wahrane Wahrane&quot;, which like a traditional Arabic pop song has a string arrangement similar to what one would have heard backing the classic Egyptian singers of a generation ago, and the final track, &quot;Hey Ouedi&quot;, with its mystical quality, is quite thrilling, with instruments seeming to imitate the sound of ululation.\n&quot;Oran Marseille&quot; with rap group IAM, only works half-way for me (I like the Khaled parts and the instrumentation), but perhaps that is because I do not care for rap music. &quot;Aisha&quot; is a signature song for Khaled, and always great to hear.&quot;\n\n&quot;Khaled is a pioneer of rai music, and his title of &quot;King of Rai&quot; is well deserved; with his gritty expressive voice, he has brought this music to every corner of the earth. Also recommended is his CD &quot;Kutche&quot;, and the live performance album with Faudel and Rachid Taha, &quot;1, 2, 3 Soleils&quot;. Khaled co-wrote all the songs except &quot;Hey Ouedi&quot;, which he wrote alone, the sound is excellent!&quot; \n\n&quot;An incredible east-meets-west album!\nKhaled delivers within this disc the most incredible taste of raÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ music ever. The music is exotic, but is sprinkled with influences of western hip-hop and pop and melts down into a sizzling, energetic, unique rythm! I recommend &quot;Sahra,&quot; &quot;Lillah,&quot; and &quot;Walou Walou.&quot; The undeniable &quot;Aicha,&quot; a unique, mesmerizing hit, has all the charm and romance of a pop ballad, without all the bubblegum and image fodder of western pop. This album is wonderful!!!&quot;\n\n&quot;I first heard &quot;Aicha&quot; in my fourth year French class back in early 2001. I had already been listening to the Egyptian goddess, Natacha Atlas, and I was familiar with the Middle Eastern sound. Khaled&amp;#039;s voice is the most gorgeous of all the RaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ singers... very smooth and hypnotic. Khaled&amp;#039;s voice will leave me in a trance, which is what North African music does. I seriously believe that anyone will like this CD and want to hear more from Khaled - &quot;the King of RaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯&quot;. \n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
