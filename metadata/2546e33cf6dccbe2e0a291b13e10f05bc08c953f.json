The game takes the player to several islands, with his job to find and save as many Gobbos (little furry creatures with big eyes) as possible and defeat the level bosses which occur every half. This is no easy feat though, for Baron Dante has set his henchmen (Dantinis) around every island you visit. They can be dispatched, but only temporarily, with a blow from your tail.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2546e33cf6dccbe2e0a291b13e10f05bc08c953f","amp;dn":"Croc+-+Legend+of+the+Gobbos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2546e33cf6dccbe2e0a291b13e10f05bc08c953f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,70,227,60,246,220,203,226,224,162,145,177,62,16,240,91,192,140,149,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
