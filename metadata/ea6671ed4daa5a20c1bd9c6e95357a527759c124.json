James made both the R&amp;B and pop charts with the album's title cut, &quot;All I Could Do Was Cry,&quot; and &quot;Trust in Me.&quot; What makes At Last a great album is not only the solid hits it contains, but also the strong variety of material throughout. James expertly handles jazz standards like &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; and &quot;A Sunday Kind of Love,&quot; as well as Willie Dixon's blues classic &quot;I Just Want to Make Love to You.&quot; James demonstrates her keen facility on the title track in particular, as she easily moves from powerful blues shouting to more subtle, airy phrasing; her Ruth Brown-inspired, bad-girl growl only adds to the intensity. James would go on to even greater success with later hits like &quot;Tell Mama,&quot; but on At Last one hears the singer at her peak in a swinging and varied program of blues, R&amp;B, and jazz standards.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea6671ed4daa5a20c1bd9c6e95357a527759c124","amp;dn":"Etta+James+-+At+Last%21+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea6671ed4daa5a20c1bd9c6e95357a527759c124","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,102,113,237,77,170,90,32,193,189,156,110,149,53,122,82,119,89,193,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
