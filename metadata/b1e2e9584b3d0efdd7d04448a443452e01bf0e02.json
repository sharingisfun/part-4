But before she ends it all, Nao first plans to document the life of her great grandmother, a Buddhist nun whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lived more than a century. A diary is NaoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only solaceÃ¢â‚¬â€and will touch lives in ways she can scarcely imagine.\n\nAcross the Pacific, we meet Ruth, a novelist living on a remote island who discovers a collection of artifacts washed ashore in a Hello Kitty lunchboxÃ¢â‚¬â€possibly debris from the devastating 2011 tsunami. As the mystery of its contents unfolds, Ruth is pulled into the past, into NaoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drama and her unknown fate, and forward into her own future.\n\nFull of OzekiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s signature humor and deeply engaged with the relationship between writer and reader, past and present, fact and fiction, quantum physics, history, and myth, A Tale for the Time Being is a brilliantly inventive, beguiling story of our shared humanity and the search for home.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1e2e9584b3d0efdd7d04448a443452e01bf0e02","amp;dn":"A+Tale+for+the+Time+Being+by+Ruth+Ozeki+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1e2e9584b3d0efdd7d04448a443452e01bf0e02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,226,233,88,75,61,14,253,215,208,68,72,164,67,69,46,1,191,14,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
