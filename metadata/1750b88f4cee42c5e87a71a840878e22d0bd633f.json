Tomorrow sees the first of three days in the mountains, so today's south westerly stage through the Auvergne to the Midi-Pyrenees region represents a precious opportunity for the sprinters and their teams. The route is rolling, rather than flat, and a lump inside the final 10km could offer a launch pad for an attack to foil the fast men. Commentary by Ned Boulting and David Millar with Daniel Friebe reporting from the roadside.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nFilesize__: 1.30 GB\r\nRun-Time__: 2h 14m\r\nContainer_: MKV\r\nVideo_____: x264 CABAC    832x468 25fps CRF 26 ~1325Kbps\r\nAudio_____: HE-AAC 64Kbps ABR 2ch 24KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1750b88f4cee42c5e87a71a840878e22d0bd633f","amp;dn":"ITV+Tour+de+France+2016+Stage+6+PDTV+x264-NX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1750b88f4cee42c5e87a71a840878e22d0bd633f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,80,184,143,76,238,66,197,232,122,113,168,64,135,142,34,208,189,99,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
