Fronted by Caribbean-\nborn Jean Patrick Baptiste and Annette, they were masterminded by French \nproducers Daniel Vangarde and Jean Kluger.\nIn 1979 Ottawan was founded by French record producers Daniel Vangarde \nand Jean Kluger and fronted by male singer Jean Patrick Baptiste and female \nsinger Annette. Kluger and Vangarde had also scored hits with The Gibson \nBrothers and Sheila B. Devotion.\nIn the United Kingdom they had two Top 10 hits. &quot;D.I.S.C.O.&quot; (the act's \ndebut single) reached number two in September 1980, while &quot;Hands Up (Give \nMe Your Heart)&quot; peaked at number three a year later. &quot;Hands Up (Give Me \nYour Heart)&quot; reached #1 in New Zealand during 1982, staying there for eight \nweeks. In France, their single &quot;You're OK&quot; (French title &quot;T'es OK&quot;) is one \nof the Top 50 best-selling singles of all time. The duo recorded in French \nas well as English.\nPatrick Baptiste left the group soon afterwards and attempted a come back \nunder the new name Pam 'n Pat, to little success. Ottawan continued as an \nact with varying line-ups for many years afterwards.\nThe Canadian band Sway had a #7 hit in Canada in 1988 with their cover of \n&quot;Hands Up (Give Me Your Heart)&quot;\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                     Ottawan - The Very Best Of\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Ottawan\nAlbum................: The Very Best Of\nGenre................: Disco\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1992\nCodec................: LAME 3.93\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: ID3 v1.1, ID3 v2.3\nPosted by............: gnv64 on 7/7/2014\nIncluded.............: NFO, M3U\nCovers...............: Front Back CD \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
