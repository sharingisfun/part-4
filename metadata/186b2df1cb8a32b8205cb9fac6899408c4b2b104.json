Some levels even contain hazards to hinder the player's progress and powerups to help him pass various challenges. Collecting gems is a requirement in some levels before players can complete the level. Some levels feature a Qualify Time in order to increase difficulty, and all levels feature a Gold Time, where players must finish the level below a specific time-frame. Beating Gold Times is not a requirement for progression in the game. Marble Blast Gold supports user created custom levels, which can be shared.\n\nInstall instructions: Just install the setup file and done!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:186b2df1cb8a32b8205cb9fac6899408c4b2b104","amp;dn":"Marble+Blast+Gold+v1.4.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"186b2df1cb8a32b8205cb9fac6899408c4b2b104","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,107,45,241,203,138,50,184,32,92,185,250,198,137,148,8,196,178,177,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
