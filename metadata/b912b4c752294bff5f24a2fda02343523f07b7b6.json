Probably best known for his picaresque novel LITTLE BIG MAN (1964) and the subsequent film by Arthur Penn, Berger explored and manipulated many genres of fiction throughout his career, including the crime novel, the hard-boiled detective story, science fiction, the utopian novel, plus re-workings of classical mythology, Arthurian legend, and the survival adventure.  Berger's use of humor, and his often biting wit led many reviewers to refer to him as a satirist or &quot;comic&quot; novelist, descriptions he preferred to reject.  His admirers often bemoaned that his talent and achievement were so under-appreciated, in view of his versatility across many forms of fiction, his precise use of language, and his probing intelligence.\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB format:\n\n* Abnormal Occurrences: Short Stories (2013)\n\n* Arthur Rex: A Legendary Novel (1978)\n\n* Being Invisible (1987)\n\n* Changing the Past (1989)\n\n* Crazy in Berlin (1958)\n\n* The Feud (1983)\n\n* The Houseguest (1988)\n\n* Killing Time (1967)\n\n* Little Big Man (1964)\n\n* Meeting Evil (2003)\n\n* Neighbors (1980)\n\n* Nowhere (1985)\n\n* Orrie's Story (1990)\n\n* Regiment of Women (1973)\n\n* Reinhart in Love (1962)\n\n* Reinhart's Women (1981)\n\n* The Return of Little Big Man (1999)\n\n* Sneaky People (1975)\n\n* Vital Parts (1970)\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n                                             &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
