Hedford left in 1998 and was replaced by Taylor-Taylor's cousin Brent DeBoer. The band's name is a play on the name of American pop artist Andy Warhol.\n\nThe band gained recognition after they were signed to Capitol Records and released their major label album debut, ...The Dandy Warhols Come Down, in 1997. In 2001, the band rose to new levels of fame after their song &quot;Bohemian Like You&quot; enjoyed extensive exposure thanks to it featuring in a Vodafone advertisement. The Dandy Warhols have released eight studio albums to date.\n\n\n\nThe Capitol Years 2010\n\n\nThe Capitol Years 1995Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2007 (also released as The Best of the Capitol Years 1995Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2007) is a greatest hits album by American alternative rock band The Dandy Warhols.
