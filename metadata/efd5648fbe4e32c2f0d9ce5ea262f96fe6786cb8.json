It is a remake of Counter-Strike, the 1999 modification of Half-Life. Built on the Source engine, the game was released in 2004 along with Half-Life 2. The game is the most played Half-Life 2 mod, according to GameSpy.\n\nAs in the original version, Counter-Strike: Source games pit a team of counter-terrorists against a team of terrorists in a series of rounds. Each round is won by either completing a mission (such as detonating a bomb or rescuing hostages) or by eliminating all members of the opposing team. Unlike Half-Life: Source, the game is a complete remake instead of a port with additional content.\t\n\nSystem Requirements:\n--------------------\n\nMinimum: 1.7 GHz Processor, 512MB RAM, DirectX 8.1 level Graphics Card (Requires support for SSE), Windows 7 (32/64-bit)/Vista/XP, Mouse, Keyboard, Internet Connection\n\nRecommended: Pentium 4 processor (3.0GHz, or better), 1GB RAM, DirectX 9 level Graphics Card, Windows 7 (32/64-bit)/Vista/XP, Mouse, Keyboard, Internet Connection\n\nMultilanguage Support:\n----------------------\n\nEnglish - (Full localization)\nFrench - (Full localization)\nGerman - (Full localization)\nRussian - (Full localization)\nSpanish - (Full localization)\n\n\nLanguage choosing in installation process.\n\nInstallation:\n-------------\nTo install game use: Counter-Strike Source v80 Multi.exe\nAfter install run autoupdater.\nChange nick use in game-console: setname &quot;your nikname&quot;\n\n\nUpdate Game Support:\n--------------------\n\nIf you need udpating game run: /css_autoupdater.exe ... few minutes ... and thats all - complete.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efd5648fbe4e32c2f0d9ce5ea262f96fe6786cb8","amp;dn":"Counter-Strike%3A+Source+1807769+%28v80%29+No-Steam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efd5648fbe4e32c2f0d9ce5ea262f96fe6786cb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,213,100,143,190,78,50,194,240,217,206,94,162,98,249,111,230,120,108,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
