At the core of the story is Bea Nightingale, a fiftyish divorced schoolteacher whose life has been on hold during the many years since her brief marriage. When her estranged, difficult brother asks her to leave New York for Paris to retrieve a nephew she barely knows, she becomes entangled in the lives of her brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family and even, after so long, her ex-husband. Every one of them is irrevocably changed by the events of just a few months in that fateful year. Traveling from New York to Paris to Hollywood, aiding and abetting her nephew and niece while waging a war of letters with her brother, facing her ex-husband and finally shaking off his lingering sneers from decades past, Bea Nightingale is a newly liberated divorcee who inadvertently wreaks havoc on the very people she tries to help.\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nCynthia Ozick - Heir to the Glimmering World (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2004).\n\nISBN: 9780618618804 | 336 pages | EPUB\n\nSet in the New York of the 1930s, Heir to the Glimmering World is a spellbinding, richly plotted novel brimming with intriguing characters. Orphaned at eighteen, with few possessions, Rose Meadows finds steady employment with the Mitwisser clan. Recently arrived from Berlin, the Mitwissers rely on the auspices of a generous benefactor, James A'Bair, the discontented heir to a fortune his father, a famous childen's author, made from a series of books called The Bear Boy. Against the vivid backdrop of a world in tumult, Rose learns the refugee family's secrets as she watches their fortunes rise and fall in Ozick's wholly engrossing novel.\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nCynthia Ozick - Quarrel &amp; Quandary: Essays (Knopf, 2000).\n\nISBN: 9780375410611 | 272 pages | EPUB\n\nIn nineteen opulent essays, Cynthia Ozick probes Dostoevsky for insights into the Unabomber, questions the role of the public intellectual, and dares to wonder what poetry is. She roams effortlessly from Kafka to James, Styron to Stein, and, in the book's most famous essay, dissects the gaudy commercialism that has reduced Anne Frank to &quot;usable goods.&quot; Courageous, audacious, and sublime, these essays have the courage of conviction, the probing of genius, and the durable audacity to matter.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:763bc09920e9282de5465851fd1336b074c3fd1b","amp;dn":"Cynthia+Ozick+-+3+books+%28novels%2C+essays%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"763bc09920e9282de5465851fd1336b074c3fd1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,59,192,153,32,233,40,45,229,70,88,81,253,19,54,176,116,195,253,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
