Will their love of all things glamour get in the way of cooking their best meals? Hosted by Pete Evans and Manu Feildel.\n\nAsh and Camilla Victoria\nEating is probably our biggest hobby. \nShe's eaten at the world-famous La Tour d'Argent, lived in Paris and had a French beau. In fact, Camilla's now ex French boyfriend is how she found her best friend Ash.\nAnd they immediately bonded over their love of European cooking and enjoying the social high life.\n&quot;We started cooking together since day dot,&quot; says Ash, which was nearly two years ago.\nSince then they've gone on to host an annual Feaster, a massive feast for family and friends over Easter, and numerous dinner parties throughout the year. So they thought, how hard could MKR be?\nSays Ash, 28: &quot;I think I'm one to seek out adventure, seek out challenges, and I thought this would be great. And I know Camilla loves cooking as much as I do and I think we work well together.&quot;\nWhile French influences will definitely come through in their cooking, they will also be highlighting Mediterranean flavours.\nAsh cites her sticky date pudding as the most moorish dish she could prepare for anyone, while outing Camilla as being &quot;obsessed with potatoes&quot;.\n&quot;Like potatoes and steak. She's literally obsessed with it. And bÃƒÂ©arnaise sauce.&quot;\nCamilla, 23, admits to being lazy when it comes to making desserts because they just don't interest her.\n&quot;I actually have no patience, like just day to day, zero patience,&quot; admits Ash. &quot;And dessert requires patience and somehow I can find patience for dessert.&quot;\nAsh, an events manager, and Camilla, a law student, are both used to being meticulously organised. There is a list for everything. But even without a detailed plan, these girls back their abilities in the kitchen.\nSays Camilla: &quot;I think we're good at improvising. Good at pulling things together with what's in the fridge.&quot;\nBut watch out when it comes time to deciding who's in charge.\n&quot;We switch head chef depending on the dish,&quot; explains Camilla. &quot;Because if one of us is head chef the whole time it's just not going to work.&quot;\nAdds Ash: &quot;We're both pretty head strong so we both like sharing the boss title.&quot;\nWith a love of fine foods, they tend to sweat it off on the tennis court or on the dance floor practicing their favourite Latin moves. Or pounding the shopping strips to stay up-to-date with the latest fashion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9152d7c7e03e8658d270968c546c62bdbde37858","amp;dn":"My.Kitchen.Rules.s06e04.WS.PDTV.x264.BF1.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9152d7c7e03e8658d270968c546c62bdbde37858","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,82,215,199,224,62,134,88,210,112,150,140,84,108,98,189,189,227,120,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
