Also,remember that Paganini really NEVER gave their performance in public.\n\nAccardo is a unique violinist in his understanding of Paganini.No other violinist in the world has never recorded practically everything that was preserved from Paganini's time.\nI'm judging not only by technique, but the interpretation and tone!Just compare his and Gidon Kremer's recording of 4th concerto for instance....\n\nSpeaking of this recording of 24 capprici, I'll be trying to be objective. Accardo brings its interpretation in a rather artistic way,while Perlman plays it as &quot;pure&quot; technical exercises (I'll be comparing with Perlman, because I do think that no other violinist - not even Ricci,Mintz,Kaler,Markov...- really reaches the qualilies of Perlman and Accardo).As far as an interpretation (tone)is concerned,I would prefer Accardo,although Perlman sounds better in octaves.Comparing the technique(not the speed),Perlman is slightly firmer in grasping the strings,but not everywhere,in general I would say that both violinists are more or less technically equal(just compare 15,16 or some other cappr.-they are almost identical which proves the virtuosity of both violinists).Perlman left hands is really slightly firmer,but in contrast, Accardo does better with his right hand (maybe here Perlman's handicap is the reason), which produces him a kind of clearer and lighter staccatos,spiccatos,ricochets and other &quot;acrobatic&quot; technique.\n\nComparing all violinist I have ever heard,my top three compared purely by technique would be: 1)Heifetz 2) Perlman/Accardo 3)the rest\n\nOne more important thing - Accardo's recording by Deutsche Grammopohon is much more analytical and clearer than EMI did with Perlman (this some Perman's not-so-sure tones are perfectly hidden).\n\nIf you seek a really natural,concentrated version of Paganinis 24 cappr.with a singing tone,void of &quot;cheap&quot; virtuosity and effects,try this,that's it and it's worth it.If you want all this plus you prefer slightly more robust tone,take Perlman.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84bfaf4169f23bfaf451e41f98fad2792c889f57","amp;dn":"Nicolo+Paganini+24+Capricci+-+Salvatore+Accardo+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84bfaf4169f23bfaf451e41f98fad2792c889f57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,191,175,65,105,242,59,250,244,81,228,31,152,250,210,121,44,136,159,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
