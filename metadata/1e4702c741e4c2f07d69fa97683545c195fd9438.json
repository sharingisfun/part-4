He is well known as part of the New Orleans sound of the Neville Brothers. Yet, aside from the 1967 number one R&amp;B hit &quot;Tell It Like It Is,&quot; few have heard his incredible early solo recordings. Many of those first recordings, in the early and mid-'60s, were arranged, produced, and often written by the brilliant Allen Toussaint -- another talent only later being really appreciated. Most of these sides were cut for the Minit and, later, Parlo labels. Songs like &quot;She Took You for a Ride&quot; and &quot;You Think You're So Smart&quot; on Parlo are masterpieces. While his more recent work, including that with Linda Ronstadt, makes for pleasant listening, it lacks the sheer persuasion of his early songs. Neville has re-recorded his early work often, and it is important to hear the originals. The early sides are just waiting to be heard. \n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t91.92% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tBlue Note\nCatalog:\t\t623489\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Money Honey\n02.My True Story\n03.Ruby Baby\n04.Gypsy Woman\n05.Ting A Ling\n06.Be My Baby\n07.Little Bitty Pretty One\n08.Tears On My Pillow\n09.Under The Boardwalk\n10.Work With Me Annie\n11.This Magic Moment/True Love\n12.Goodnight My Love (Pleasant Dreams)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e4702c741e4c2f07d69fa97683545c195fd9438","amp;dn":"Aaron+Neville+-+My+True+Story+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e4702c741e4c2f07d69fa97683545c195fd9438","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,71,2,199,65,228,194,240,125,105,250,151,104,53,69,193,149,253,148,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
