This film jump started a genre. Hal Hartley's masterpiece brims with clever dialogue and funny performances. Adrianne Shelley is a standout as Audrey who is convinced that the world is soon to blow up. Chris Cooke should be getting a lot more work after his winning performance as Vic Hugo. He's a delight to watch as his daughter Audrey bargains with him on about going to college. And Robert Burke is great as the quiet Josh, the returning man with a past. You catch something new every time with this film ... like the funny way everyone fights in the movie (elaborate pushing matches). An original film and thoroughly enjoyable. Great soundtrack too ... under Hal Hartley's alias of Ned Rifle. Highly recommended ... and definitely more than worth than 50Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ at your video rental and won't put you to sleep if you like original, clever, landmark Indy films like this one is.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : The.Unbelievable.Truth.1989.Divx5.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 698 MiB\n      Duration : 1h 30mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 081 Kbps\n      Writing application : Nandub v1.0rc2\n      Writing library : Nandub build 1852/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Codec ID : DX50\n      Codec ID/Hint : DivX 5\n      Duration : 1h 30mn\n      Bit rate : 979 Kbps\n      Width : 544 pixels\n      Height : 288 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.889\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.261\n      Stream size : 632 MiB (91%)\n      Writing library : DivX 5.0.2 (UTC 2002-05-16)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 30mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 92.1 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 32.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 59.5 MiB (9%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 36 ms (0.86 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 162 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.92\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100842/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100842/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; French and Spanish subtitles\n\nHal Hartley - The Unbelievable Truth (1989)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5e23e8a8c6cd86a9b84aa16c6e72c58abcde43f","amp;dn":"Hal+Hartley+-+The+Unbelievable+Truth+%281989%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5e23e8a8c6cd86a9b84aa16c6e72c58abcde43f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,226,62,138,140,108,216,106,155,132,170,22,198,231,44,88,171,205,228,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
