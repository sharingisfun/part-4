Haug\nPublisher: Wiley\nDate: 2012\nPages: 397\nFormat: PDF\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0470621702\nISBN-13: 978-0470621707\nSize: 12.51 MB\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDescription:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA practical approach to estimating and tracking dynamic systems in real-worl applications.\n\nMuch of the literature on performing estimation for non-Gaussian systems is short on practical methodology, while Gaussian methods often lack a cohesive derivation. Bayesian Estimation and Tracking addresses the gap in the field on both accounts, providing readers with a comprehensive overview of methods for estimating both linear and nonlinear dynamic systems driven by Gaussian and non-Gaussian noices.\n\nFeaturing a unified approach to Bayesian estimation and tracking, the book emphasizes the derivation of all tracking algorithms within a Bayesian framework and describes effective numerical methods for evaluating density-weighted integrals, including linear and nonlinear Kalman filters for Gaussian-weighted integrals and particle filters for non-Gaussian cases. The author first emphasizes detailed derivations from first principles of eeach estimation method and goes on to use illustrative and detailed step-by-step instructions for each method that makes coding of the tracking filter simple and easy to understand.\n\nCase studies are employed to showcase applications of the discussed topics. In addition, the book supplies block diagrams for each algorithm, allowing readers to develop their own MATLABÃ‚Â® toolbox of estimation methods.\n\nBayesian Estimation and Tracking is an excellent book for courses on estimation and tracking methods at the graduate level. The book also serves as a valuable reference for research scientists, mathematicians, and engineers seeking a deeper understanding of the topics.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the Author:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnton J.
