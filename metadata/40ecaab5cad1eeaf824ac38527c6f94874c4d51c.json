What about a hurricane, flood, tornado, or house fire? It all starts with developing a practical disaster preparedness plan for your family. The Handbook to Practical Disaster Preparedness is the only book that provides step-by-step instructions for developing that plan. It emphasizes practical preparations and avoids the scare tactics of many other books.\n\nThe 440-page handbook is a complete guide to creating a practical disaster preparedness plan. The 3rd Edition has been expanded to cover every important topic, including food storage, water purification, home improvements, electricity generation, backup heating, personal protection, financial preparations, communication systems, disaster preparedness networks, evacuations, life-saving first aid, and much more. An entire chapter is also provided for people with special needs, including the elderly, those with young children, people with disabilities, and pet owners.\n\nInside the handbook are hundreds of photographs, tables, and useful tips. The new larger 8&quot; x 10&quot; format also includes easy-to-copy worksheets to help organize your family's preparedness plans. Working through the steps identified in this book will prepare your family for nearly any disaster, whether it be natural disasters making the news daily (e.g., earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, and tsunamis), or high-impact global events, such as electromagnetic pulse attacks, radiological emergencies, solar storms, or our country's impending financial collapse.\n\nDiscover why this handbook is being praised by emergency management experts, preppers, church groups, survivalists, bloggers, soccer moms, and people from every walk of life. Now is the time to take responsibility for your family's safety by putting into place important emergency preparations.\n\nAbout the Author:\nDr. Arthur Bradley holds a doctorate in engineering from Auburn University and currently works for NASA.
