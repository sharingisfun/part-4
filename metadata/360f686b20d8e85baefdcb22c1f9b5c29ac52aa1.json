An exploration, as well as a celebration, of structure, the book draws on a series of design studies and case study examples to illustrate how structure can be employed to realize a wide range of concepts in contemporary architecture. By examining design principles that relate to both architecture and structural engineering, Andrew Charleson provides new insights into the relationship between both the technical and aesthetic aspects of architecture.\n\nNow in its second edition, the text has been extensively revised and updated throughout. Features include:\n-  A brand new chapter on hidden structure, adding to the material on exposed structures\n-  Two new chapters on using structure to realise common architectural concepts through a combination of precedents and creative design\n-  Over 50 new case studies from across the globe\n-  Easy-to-understand diagrams and a highly visual design to aid understanding and accessibility\n\nMore than two hundred case studies of contemporary buildings from countries such as the UK, the US, France, Germany, Spain, Hong Kong, Australia and Japan illustrate how a thorough integration of structure adds layers of richness and enhances the realisation of architectural design concepts.\n\nAbout the Author\nAndrew Charleson has visited, photographed and analysed almost all of the case-study buildings. He is an Associate Professor at the School of Architecture, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. Bringing over forty years structural engineering experience to the topic, he has also authored the book Seismic Design for Architects: Outwitting the Quake and published many papers, not only related to the subject of this book, but also to his other areas of research interest, earthquake engineering and earthquake architecture. \n\nCONTENTS\nList of figures viii\nPreface xx\nAcknowledgements xxi\nChapter 1.
