He is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven,\nhe encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet sitting by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean), the unremembered past comes flooding back. Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse \non a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie - magical, comforting, wise beyond her years - promised to protect him, no matter what.\n\nA groundbreaking work from a master, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out. A stirring, terrifying, and elegiac fable as delicate as a butterfly's wing and as menacing as a knife in the dark.\n\n\n\nRunning Time:  5 hours, 48 minutes\n\n\n\nPublished by Harper Audio\n\nRelease Date:  June 18, 2013 \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:217866aacefbed938d97b20f6e1c26cde2115d1d","amp;dn":"The+Ocean+at+the+End+of+the+Lane+%28Audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"217866aacefbed938d97b20f6e1c26cde2115d1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,120,102,170,206,251,237,147,141,151,178,15,110,28,38,205,226,17,93,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
