Then one day you happened to open your garage \ndoor and sitting there, right in front of you, was the film you had been \nsearching for. This is what happened to Eric Bana and this time around, the co-\nstar is his very own Ford GT Falcon Coupe- THE BEAST. Eric realized the story \nwas in fact, about him, his first car, a lifetime of ownership and a lifetime of \nfriendship. He set about documenting his own 25 year long love story. A simple \ntale of one man's ongoing relationship with his very first car. After years of \nprecious restoration, Eric and his 3 closest friends, decided to enter the car \ninto one of the most grueling and dangerous motor races that exists: The Targa \nTasmania Rally. This would be a personal Everest for both man and machine, \nuntil...on day 4 of the race, tragedy strikes. The man who was hell bent on \ntrying to convey how much he and those around him loved &quot;THE BEAST&quot;, had just \ndestroyed it. Eric has now unwillingly cast himself in his own real life drama. \nWe follow him from inside the race car to the surreal world of the red carpet. \nThis compelling true story follows Eric's progression as a car lover, and as a \nperson conflicted by what he has done. The personal and social pressures mount \nup in the face of re building a car that means so much to him. Along the way \nEric seeks guidance and wisdom from not only the inner sanctum of his 3 life \nlong friends but also Jay Leno, Jeremy Clarkson, and Dr Phil\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b970cb1e8a031bde208aa6bab1cfbebf6f45bb92","amp;dn":"Love+The+Beast+2009+DVDRiP+XViD+SB0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b970cb1e8a031bde208aa6bab1cfbebf6f45bb92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,112,203,30,138,3,27,222,32,138,166,186,177,207,190,191,111,69,187,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
