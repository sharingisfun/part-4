But Woyzeck, a rifleman assigned as an orderly, hears voices -- the times are out of joint, at least in his cosmos. To his captain, Woyzeck is a comic marvel: ignorant but courageous, full of energy to little purpose. To a local doctor, Woyzeck is a curiosity, the object of cruel study. Woyzeck, 40, has a young wife, Marie, and a small child. He dotes on them, but Marie, even though she has periods of guilt and remorse, carries on affairs and flirtations. When the captain lets drop broad hints of Woyzeck&amp;#039;s being a cuckold, his inner demons and the voices of the spheres take over. Will madness bring action? Of what sort?\n\nContainer: avi and 2 srts (english and english letterbox)\n\nSpecs:\n\nFile Name .........................................: woyzeck.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 937,249,522 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:17:18\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x360 (AR: 1.778)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1476 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.256 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 44100 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n\n***********************************FREAKYFLICKS************************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
