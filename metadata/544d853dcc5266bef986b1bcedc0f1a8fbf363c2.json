To celebrate its hundredth anniversary, the Freeport-, Maine-based company has updated Hunting, Fishing and Camping, Leon Leonwood BeanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no-nonsense guide to enjoying the great outdoors. Originally published in 1942, this Maine classic offers instruction on everything from packing a canoe to stalking a bear. The new edition pairs the original text and nostalgic photographs with twenty-first-century perspective from L.L's great-grandson and Outdoor Channel television host, Bill Gorman. This entertaining and instructive book is not only a commemorative celebration of L.L.BeanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legacy and his commitment to conservation Ã¢â‚¬â€ it is a must-have manual for the modern sportsman.\n\nAbout the Author\nBILL GORMAN, great-grandson of L.L. Bean, obtained his first rifle in 1967, when he was six. He still has it, along with a passion for hunting that has spanned a lifetime. Bill has worked at L.L.Bean since 1988. He is an avid bow hunter, has two wonderful children (two of his favorite hunting partners) and hosts his own hunting show, L.L.Bean Guide to the Outdoors.
