Beginning with a discussion of the basic science of radiobiology, the book explains the fast processes that initiate damage in irradiated tissue and the kinetic patterns in which such damage is expressed at the cellular level. The final section is presented in a highly practical handbook style and offers application-based discussions in radiation oncology, fractionated radiotherapy, and protracted radiation among others. The text is also supplemented by a Web site.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cca804be219c2906fecb6ca10dfb96157801118e","amp;dn":"Radiobiology+of+Medical+Imaging%2C+2014+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cca804be219c2906fecb6ca10dfb96157801118e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,168,4,190,33,156,41,6,254,203,108,161,13,251,150,21,120,1,17,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
