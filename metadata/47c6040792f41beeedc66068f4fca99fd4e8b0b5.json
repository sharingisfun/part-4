As a Marxist historiographer he has focused on analysis of the &quot;dual revolution&quot; (the political French revolution and the industrial British revolution). He sees their effect as a driving force behind the predominant trend towards liberal capitalism today. Another recurring theme in his work has been social banditry, a phenomenon that Hobsbawm has tried to place within the confines of relevant societal and historical context thus countering the traditional view of it being a spontaneous and unpredictable form of primitive rebellion.\n\n\nOutside of his academic historical writing, Hobsbawm has written a regular column (under the pseudonym 'Francis Newton' ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ taken from the name of Billie Holiday's communist trumpet player, Frankie Newton) for the New Statesman as a jazz critic, and time to time over popular music such as with his &quot;Beatles and before&quot; article. He has published numerous essays in various intellectual journals, dealing with subjects like barbarity in the modern age to the troubles of labour movements and the conflict between anarchism and communism. His most recent publications are Globalisation, Democracy and Terrorism (2007), On Empire (2008), and the collection of essays How to \nChange the World: Marx and Marxism 1840-2009 (2010).\n\nBrilliant and incisive, HOW TO CHANGE THE WORLD leaves us in no doubt that Karl Marx is as much a thinker for our century as he was for the preceding two","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47c6040792f41beeedc66068f4fca99fd4e8b0b5","amp;dn":"Eric+Hobsbawm+4+ebooks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47c6040792f41beeedc66068f4fca99fd4e8b0b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,198,4,7,146,244,27,238,237,198,96,104,244,252,169,159,212,232,176,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
