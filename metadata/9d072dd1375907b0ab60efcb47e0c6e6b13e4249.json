It is so important that it provides the fundamental underpinning of all modern sciences. Without it, we'd have no nuclear power or nuclear weapons, no TV, no computers, no science of molecular biology, no understanding of DNA, no genetic engineering. In Search of Schrodinger's Cat tells the complete story of quantum mechanics, a truth stranger than any fiction. John Gribbin takes us step by step into an ever more bizarre and fascinating place, requiring only that we approach it with an open mind. He introduces the scientists who developed quantum theory. He investigates the atom, radiation, time travel, the birth of the universe, superconductors and life itself. And in a world full of its own delights, mysteries and surprises, he searches for Schrodinger's Cat - a search for quantum reality - as he brings every reader to a clear understanding of the most important area of scientific study today - quantum physics. In Search of Schrodinger's Cat is a fascinating and delightful introduction to the strange world of the quantum - an essential element in understanding today's world.\n\n1984","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d072dd1375907b0ab60efcb47e0c6e6b13e4249","amp;dn":"In+Search+of+Schr%26ouml%3Bdinger%27s+Cat%3A+Quantum+Physics+and+Reality","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d072dd1375907b0ab60efcb47e0c6e6b13e4249","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,7,45,209,55,89,7,176,171,96,239,203,71,224,198,230,177,62,66,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
