Extract simcity societies.rar. You will need a program like winrar to do this, if you can&amp;#039;t open, google and install winrar.\n\n2. Run AutoRun.exe. Click &amp;#039;next&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;I accept&amp;#039; and whatever and wait for the installer to finish. When it asks for the key run keygen.exe and hit generate, it should fill in the boxes for you.\n\n3. Run SCS_10016_DP1.exe in the patch folder, this is the first patch.\n\n4. Find the folder where the game was installed, this is usually C:Program FilesElectronic ArtsSimCity? Societies. Copy (don&amp;#039;t drag and drop, copy) SimCitySocieties.exe. If it asks if you want to replace the exsisting file say &quot;Yes&quot;. If it doesn&amp;#039;t ask you if you want to replace the exsisting file, then you did it wrong. Make sure you actually copy it, don&amp;#039;t just do a normal drag and drop, otherwise it might just make a shortcut.\n\n5. Run the game!\n\nNote: If you ever install a new patch you will need to find a new version of the crack, this really does matter! I&amp;#039;ve tried it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c01dbb7b9170dd25825508ab5c4900a8b09fbaf4","amp;dn":"Simcity+Societies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c01dbb7b9170dd25825508ab5c4900a8b09fbaf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,29,187,123,145,112,221,37,130,85,8,171,92,73,0,168,176,159,186,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
