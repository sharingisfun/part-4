Now change is coming to Bordeaux, with traditional customers like the US and the UK falling away, as ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new rich push prices to stratospheric levels. The demand is unprecedented, but the product is finite and this new client wants it all. Will the China market be the bubble that never bursts or the biggest threat yet to BordeauxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s centuries old reputation?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a3e816d4b9cdd5b3c7453f7137fd381ac3cefc6","amp;dn":"Red+Obsession+%282013%29+BluRay+1080p+5.1CH+x264+Ganool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a3e816d4b9cdd5b3c7453f7137fd381ac3cefc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,62,129,109,75,156,221,91,60,116,83,247,19,127,211,129,172,60,239,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
