Well imagine no more, that&amp;#039;s exactly what this revolutionary &quot;award-winning&quot; virtual instrument does. In addition, this is the first 24-bit Choir virtual instrument to include three simultaneous stereo mic setups (close, stage and hall), so users can mix any combination of mic positions to control ambience. The Choirs were recorded in the same concert hall, by the same team as the EastWest/Quantum Leap Symphonic Orchestra and blend perfectly with EWQLSO.\n\n\nThis is the library, DON&amp;#039;T FORGET TO DOWNLOAD THE INSTAL!!!!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9680f0954084f636e98ef7415ca2eee6cb8fd0e","amp;dn":"Symphonic+Choirs+%28Library%29+DON%5C%27T+FORGET+TO+DOWNLOAD+THE+I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9680f0954084f636e98ef7415ca2eee6cb8fd0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,104,15,9,84,8,79,99,110,152,239,116,21,202,46,238,108,184,253,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
