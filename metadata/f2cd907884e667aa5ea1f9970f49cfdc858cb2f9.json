He walks you through the steps in the life of a business from entrepreneurial infancy, through adolescent growing pains, to the mature entrepreneurial perspective, the guiding light of all businesses that succeed. He then shows how to apply the lessons of franchising to any business whether or not it is a franchise. Finally, Gerber draws the vital, often overlooked distinction between working on your business and working in your business. After you have read The E-Myth Revisited, you will truly be able to grow your business in a predictable and productive way.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2cd907884e667aa5ea1f9970f49cfdc858cb2f9","amp;dn":"The+E-Myth+Revisited+-+Why+Most+small+businesses+don%27t+work+-+Mi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2cd907884e667aa5ea1f9970f49cfdc858cb2f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,205,144,120,132,230,103,170,94,161,249,151,15,73,207,220,133,140,178,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
