But now, more secrets behind the ancient Roman city are being revealed with the help of new technologies in Science Channel's Lost World Of Pompeii\r\nPompeii is a delicately conserved attraction that is under constant threat from the wears and tear of extensive tourism, the specter of landslides and the possibility of another devastating eruption from Mount Vesuvius. This all new one-hour special goes behind-the-scenes of Pompeii with a collection of scientists as they use new science to try to finish piecing together the relics of Pompeii's past before time runs out. Lost World Of Pompeii merges technology with history to reveal a clearer picture of what exactly happened on that day, thousands of years ago when the volcano erupted. The special features a group of experts from around the world who are leading teams of archaeologists, volcanologists, architects and scientists to search for new evidence on what life was like before the day of Vesuvius's deadly eruption. To bring the buried city back to life, all aspects of society are researched in Lost World Of Pompeii\r\nA team of archaeologists and anthropologists use X-ray technology on ancient body casts to gather information on the life that was lived by the persons inside. Not only do these scans reveal information about the subject's age and their occupation, but they can also be used to digitally reconstruct the faces of those lost - with details accurate enough to determine their ethnic lineage. To revive their wisdom, a group led by Dr. Emmanuel Brun uses a synchrotron - an extremely powerful source of X-rays- to try to see inside a set of ancient scrolls that were scorched shut in the disaster. And to sculpt the structures that kept the civilization thriving, architects aim to create the first-ever complete 3D model of the city.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d0/Lost-World-of-Pompeii-Screen0.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/0/0d/Lost-World-of-Pompeii-Screen1.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/f/f5/Lost-World-of-Pompeii-Screen2.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/e/e6/Lost-World-of-Pompeii-Screen3.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/2/27/Lost-World-of-Pompeii-Screen4.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/3/33/Lost-World-of-Pompeii-Screen5.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/c/ce/Lost-World-of-Pompeii-Screen6.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/a/a5/Lost-World-of-Pompeii-Screen7.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/b/b5/Lost-World-of-Pompeii-Screen8.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/6/68/Lost-World-of-Pompeii-Screen9.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/b/be/Lost-World-of-Pompeii-Screen10.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/a/a5/Lost-World-of-Pompeii-Screen11.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/3/30/Lost-World-of-Pompeii-Screen12.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/f/f9/Lost-World-of-Pompeii-Screen13.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/1/18/Lost-World-of-Pompeii-Screen14.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/a/ab/Lost-World-of-Pompeii-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF-21 (~3638 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 44 mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container MP4\r\n * Part Size: 1.14 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \r\n * http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/Science-Channel-to-Present-One-Hour-Special-LOST-WORLD-OF-POMPEII-Today-20160711","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e140349f4211b5141c1d6d22347e3c3e714be58f","amp;dn":"Science.Ch.Lost.World.of.Pompeii.720p.HDTV.x264.AAC.MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e140349f4211b5141c1d6d22347e3c3e714be58f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,64,52,159,66,17,181,20,28,29,109,34,52,126,60,62,113,75,229,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
