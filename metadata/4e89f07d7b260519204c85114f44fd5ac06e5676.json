Her second journey, two decades later, brought them together again in the American colonies. But Claire had left someone behind in the twentieth centuryÃ¢â‚¬â€their daughter, Brianna....\n\nNow Brianna has made a disturbing discovery that sends her to the circle of stones and a terrifying leap into the unknown. In search of her mother and the father she has never met, she is risking her own future to try to change history ... and to save their lives. But as Brianna plunges into an uncharted wilderness, a heartbreaking encounter may strand her forever in the past ... or root her in the place she should be, where her heart and soul belong....(","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e89f07d7b260519204c85114f44fd5ac06e5676","amp;dn":"Drums+of+Autumn+%28Outlander%2C+%234%29+-+Diana+Gabaldon.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e89f07d7b260519204c85114f44fd5ac06e5676","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,137,240,125,123,38,5,25,32,76,133,17,79,68,253,90,192,110,86,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
