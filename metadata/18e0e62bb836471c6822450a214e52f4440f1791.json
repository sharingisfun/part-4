They play tracks from their upcoming ninth studio album Alone, their first since 2008. Joining them will be the record's producer, Dan 'The Black Keys' Auerbach. Two black British artists are making their TV debuts on the show tonight. Londoner Samm Henshaw is shaping up to be a new star of British rock and soul. South London unsigned singer and rapper Ray BLK has grown out of the British grime scene and has been getting a lot of attention for her soulful and honest R&amp;B tracks. Also making their debut on the show are Empire of the Sun, the collaboration between Luke Steele, of alternative rock act The Sleepy Jackson, and Nick Littlemore, of electronic dance outfit Pnau. They showcase a couple of tracks from their much anticipated third album Two Vines. And chatting to Jools is Paul Rodgers, original member of Free and Bad Company.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: h264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: 6284Kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 50i/MBAFF\r\nAudio Codec: AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate: 384Kbps CBR 48KHz\r\nAudio Channels: 6\r\nRun-Time: 63 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 3.08 GB\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18e0e62bb836471c6822450a214e52f4440f1791","amp;dn":"BBC+Later+with+Jools+Holland+S49E05+1080i+HDTV+h264-NX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18e0e62bb836471c6822450a214e52f4440f1791","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,224,230,43,184,54,71,28,104,34,69,10,33,78,82,244,68,15,23,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
