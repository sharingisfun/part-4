Running through Antony's gently daft speech are all the elemental themes of his music-- oceans, dying leaves, blood from wombs-- and he delivers it in such a chatty, affectionate, teasing tone that by the end, you are not only disarmed, but lit by a small glow of wonder. And then, of course, he resumes playing and singing.\nBy Jayson Greene\n\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Indie / Chamber pop\nQuality: 320 kbps\nTracklist:\n\nAntony and the Johnsons - Cut The World\n01 - Cut the World [Live].mp3\n02 - Future Feminism [Live].mp3\n03 - Cripple and the Starfish [Live].mp3\n04 - You Are My Sister [Live].mp3\n05 - Swanlights [Live].mp3\n06 - Epilepsy Is Dancing [Live].mp3\n07 - Another World [Live].mp3\n08 - Kiss My Name [Live].mp3\n09 - I Fell in Love With a Dead Boy [Live].mp3\n10 - Rapture [Live].mp3\n11 - The Crying Light [Live].mp3\n12 - Twilight [Live].mp3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69439b68c9ae3eafb722cc79dad28d06c39bc95a","amp;dn":"Antony+and+the+Johnsons+-+Cut+The+World+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69439b68c9ae3eafb722cc79dad28d06c39bc95a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,67,155,104,201,174,62,175,183,34,204,121,218,210,141,6,195,155,201,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
