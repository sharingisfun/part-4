An incendiary musical chapter of the band that featured Steve Vai &amp; Adrian Vandenberg on guitars, bassist Rudy Sarzo, drummer Tommy Aldridge &amp; singer David Coverdale; a high octane performance, firing on all cylinders. Every effort has been made to bring the very best out of what is an incredible, never before seen, visual treat capturing one of the most musically intense line-ups of Whitesnake performing in front of over 70,000 people. \n\nTracklist [320k MP3]\n\nCD1\n\n01.\tSlip Of The Tongue\n02.\tSlide It In\n03.\tJudgement Day\n04.\tSlow An Easy\n05.\tKittenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Got Claws\n06.\tAdagio For Strato\n07.\tFlying Dutchman Boogie\n08.\tIs This Love\n09.\tCheap AnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Nasty\n10.\tCrying In The Rain (featuring Tommy Aldridge Drum Solo)\n\nCD2\n\n01.\tFool For Your Loving\n02.\tFor The Love Of God\n03.\tThe Audience Is Listening\n04.\tHere I Go Again\n05.\tBad Boys\n06.\tAinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t No Love In The Heart Of The City\n07.\tStill Of The Night","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f765105b4da85e32ec1781133c979a19b8bd4b7f","amp;dn":"Whitesnake+-+LIVE+At+Donington+1990+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f765105b4da85e32ec1781133c979a19b8bd4b7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,101,16,91,77,168,94,50,236,23,129,19,60,151,154,25,184,189,75,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
