This is a 4-volume book whose full title is:\n&quot;Encyclopaedia Biblica; a Critical Dictionary of the Literary, Political and Religious History, the Archaeology, Geography, and Natural History of the Bible&quot;\n\nPublished between 1899-1903, the authors of the articles in the book include most of the most respected biblical scholars at the time it was written. More than 50 scholars contributed to the book; several held senior professorships at important universities. Many even held the highest academic qualification Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the Doctor of Divinity.\n\nAlthough the recent archeological discoveries have made some articles obsolete, but most of the articles are still very influential, and often form part of the foundations of modern biblical studies.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddf514192e75450293f64c92dd9a69966ac2eee1","amp;dn":"Criticism+of+the+Bible+-+Collection+20+%28Encyclopaedia+Biblica%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddf514192e75450293f64c92dd9a69966ac2eee1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,245,20,25,46,117,69,2,147,246,76,146,221,154,105,150,106,194,238,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
