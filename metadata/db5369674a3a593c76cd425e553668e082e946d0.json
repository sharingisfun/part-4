Sequenced in the chronological order in which they occurred, the 77-song, six-CD boxed set contains 38 previously unreleased recordings. After a labor-intensive process of reviewing every inch of multi-track tape, co-producer Andy Zax selected the very best from each of the 33 sets and furthered the collection's authenticity by including stage announcements, set banter, the sounds of rain, a cameo appearance by Abbie Hoffman, and the graciousness of Max Yasgur's address to the crowd, heard for the first time in its entirety. \n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.

On Friday, the roads were so clogged with cars that performing artists had to arrive by helicopter. Though over 100,000 tickets were sold prior to the festival weekend, they became unnecessary as swarms of people descended on the concert grounds to take part in this historic and peaceful happening. Four days of musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ half a million peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ rain, and the rest is history.\n\nDisc 5:\n\n01. Joe Cocker - Feelin' Alright\n02. Joe Cocker - Let's Go Get Stoned\n03.
