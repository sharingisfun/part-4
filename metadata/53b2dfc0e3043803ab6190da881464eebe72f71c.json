While patrolling for geth, the Normandy is attacked by an unknown starship, and many crew members die, including Navigator Pressly. The remainder of the crew is then forced to evacuate. During the evacuation, Shepard tosses Joker into the NormandyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s final escape pod before being blasted into space. After a suit breach, Shepard dies of asphyxiation and his/her body is pulled into the orbit of a nearby planet. With the help of former squadmate Liara TÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Soni, ShepardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body is retrieved by a human supremacist organization called Cerberus and made the subject of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Project Lazarus,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ whose only goal is ShepardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s resurrection. Once revived, Shepard awakes aboard a besieged station, and escapes with the help of Cerberus agent Jacob Taylor and Lazarus Project head Miranda Lawson. Immediately after, Shepard is given an audience with the Illusive Man, head of Cerberus.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPC MINIMUM System Requirements\nOS = Windows XP SP3 / Windows Vista SP1 / Windows 7\nProcessor = 1.8GHz Intel Core 2 Duo or equivalent AMD CPU\nMemory = 1 GB RAM for Windows XP / 2 GB RAM for Windows Vista and Windows 7\nHard Drive = 15 GB\nDVD ROM = 1x Speed\nSound Card = DirectX 9.0c compatible\nDirect X = DirectX 9.0c August 2008 (included)\nInput = Keyboard / Mouse\nVideo Card = 256 MB (with Pixel Shader 3.0 support).
