Unlike similar texts, which concentrate on quantum physics and provide only brief examples of chemical applications, Quantum Mechanics in Chemistry focuses on the topics a chemist needs to know. It provides an introduction to the fundamentals of quantum mechanics as they apply to chemistry, then moves on to the more modern aspects of the field, which are very important in industry and are not emphasized in any other text. It also includes introductions to molecular spectroscopy, chemical dynamics, and computational chemistry as applied to electronic structures","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81347ac5428e20ef26cf8d1b4570478e84425d21","amp;dn":"Quantum+Mechanics+in+Chemistry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81347ac5428e20ef26cf8d1b4570478e84425d21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,52,122,197,66,142,32,239,38,207,141,27,69,112,71,142,132,66,93,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
