At the urging of family friend and School Principal he reluctantly accepts a substitute teaching job at the Creative Arts and Technology School. Wayne initially falters in this unfamiliar role as he fails to be taken seriously by his students and the particularly watchful eye of the Vice Principal. But with guidance from fellow teacher Ms. Amy Danville, Wayne discovers he is uniquely adept at encouraging his students to enjoy learning by organizing a student film festival. Not only does Wayne win over his classroom but he captures the affection of the lovely Ms. Danville as well. Just as it seems Wayne has settled in he gets the news heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been waiting for: heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been offered the lead role in a zombie movie! Unfortunately, filming begins in Canada a week before the schoolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s festival. Doing the movie means certainly disappointing his students and Amy. Wayne must decide what is most important Ã¢â‚¬â€œ pursuit of his lifelong dream or upholding the commitments heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s made.\n\nCast:\n\nEric Mabius ... Wayne Wenders \nVirginia Williams ...
