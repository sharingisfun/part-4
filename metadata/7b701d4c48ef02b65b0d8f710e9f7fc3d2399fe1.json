A combat veteran, Puller is the man the U.S. Army relies on to investigate the toughest crimes facing the nation. Now he has a new case-but this time, the crime is personal: His aunt has been found dead in Paradise, Florida.\n\nA picture-perfect town on Florida's Gulf Coast, Paradise thrives on the wealthy tourists and retirees drawn to its gorgeous weather and beaches. The local police have ruled his aunt's death an unfortunate, tragic accident. But just before she died, she mailed a letter to Puller's father, telling him that beneath its beautiful veneer, Paradise is not all it seems to be.\n\nWhat Puller finds convinces him that his aunt's death was no accident . . . and that the palm trees and sandy beaches of Paradise may hide a conspiracy so shocking that some will go to unthinkable lengths to make sure the truth is never revealed.\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                          Published - \n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b701d4c48ef02b65b0d8f710e9f7fc3d2399fe1","amp;dn":"The+Forgotten+by+David+Baldacci+%28Puller+02%29+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b701d4c48ef02b65b0d8f710e9f7fc3d2399fe1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,112,29,76,72,239,2,182,91,13,143,113,14,159,127,195,210,57,159,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
