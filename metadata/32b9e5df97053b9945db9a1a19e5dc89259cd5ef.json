Only Yazoo: The Best Of represents some of the best synth pop ever committed to record, and provides a fine display of the range and power of Alison Moyet's incredible voice. All of the singles are present (with the exception of &quot;The Other Side of Love&quot;), as well as a handful of quality album tracks. Thankfully, the Francois Kevorkian mix of &quot;Situation&quot; is included, as well as three &quot;1999&quot; mixes. These modern mixes don't reach the same heights as the originals, and the Todd Terry remix of &quot;Don't Go&quot; almost manages to ruin a beautiful song. However, for the most part, Only Yazoo is close to perfect. Tracks like &quot;Nobody's Diary&quot; remain landmarks of pop songwriting, although the sparse arrangements sometimes sound dated. Even so, it's a great album, and a fine overview of Yazoo's brief career. ~ Jim Harper, All Music Guide\n\n\nAfter writing most of Depeche Mode's debut album, SPEAK AND SPELL, Vince Clarke left that band and hooked up with singer/pianist Alison Moyet, whose booming, soulful, R&amp;B-inflected voice could not have been more different from that of Depeche Mode's Dave Gahan. The combination of Moyet's incredible voice and Clarke's electronic pop songs gave Yaz (known as Yazoo outside the US) a unique sound that lasted far beyond its brief lifespan. In fact, this 1999 compilation was actually spurred by the success of a popular television commercial featuring its lovely ballad &quot;Only You.&quot;\n\nCombining the best parts of the duo's two albums, 1982's UPSTAIRS AT ERIC'S and 1983's YOU AND ME BOTH, with a couple of new remixes, this collection is most notable for including the superior single mix of the dance club classic &quot;Situation.&quot; A fine introduction to an influential act.\n\nAll Artwork Included At 300dpi\n\n\nAll tracks accurately ripped\n\nNo errors occurred\n\nEnd of status report\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazoo_%28band%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazoo_%28band%29&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32b9e5df97053b9945db9a1a19e5dc89259cd5ef","amp;dn":"Yazoo+-+Only+Yazoo+%28The+Best+Of%29+%281999%29+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32b9e5df97053b9945db9a1a19e5dc89259cd5ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,185,229,223,151,5,59,153,69,219,154,26,25,229,220,137,37,156,213,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
