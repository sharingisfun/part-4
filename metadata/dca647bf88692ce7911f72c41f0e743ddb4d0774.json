Lou not only could master a song with a great baritone voice, but he also could tell stories that weaved into the song - check out &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; and &quot;World of Trouble&quot; - two songs that brought back great memories when I listened to the entire album (for the first time, I have to add).&quot; \n\n&quot;This is truly one of the greatest jazz albums of the 1960s. It has it all: soul, humor and hipness. Lou Rawls is always good, but this recording shows him in his prime -- in great voice, and at the height of his creativity. The material is sensational, and so is the accompaniment. The great Herb Ellis is on guitar, and the piano player, Tommy Strode, brings tears to your eyes. Whatever happened to him? He should be in a hall of fame somewhere.&quot;\n\n&quot;I have owned this album in every format since its release: LP, 8-track, cassette and I am thrilled it is finally available on CD. I bought a bunch of equipment, software and an old Dual turntable primarily so that I could digitize this treasure before it turned to dust. This is the soulful, gritty, down-home, bluesy Lou Rawls that made me a fan in the early 60s. He has never come close to this since. Rawls's pipes are still great but when I want violins to accompany songs, I go to the symphony. This is the real deal. I only wish he'd recapture this magic. In the meantime, I'll have this CD.&quot; \n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
