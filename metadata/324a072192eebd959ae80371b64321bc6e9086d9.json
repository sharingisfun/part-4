They have unique properties that combine high strength with features of non-metallic materials. Polymer concretes (PC) appear to offer many possibilities for producing new materials with desired physical and mechanical characteristics, such as improved mechanical strength, low permeability, and greater chemical resistance. Advanced Polymer Concretes and Compounds presents the results of theoretical and experimental research on efficient building material composites based on advanced polymer binders.\n\nThis book examines the composition and properties of two new polymer concretes that have potential to solve various construction issues: rubber concrete based on a polybutadiene binder and silicate polymer concrete with an organo-silicate matrix. It examines the physical, mechanical, and technological properties of these PCs as well as their behavior in harsh environments and durability and reliability issues. The authors describe a new environmentally friendly polymer for monolithic industrial floor coverings and coatingsÃ¢â‚¬â€nonisocyanate polyurethanes. They also discuss advanced crack-resistant coatings based on water dispersion of chlorosulfonated polyethylene, which can be used on concrete, metal, and plastic for various industrial uses such as aircraft, automobiles, paint, and in shipbuilding and civil engineering.\n\nThe book covers a new type of epoxy composition with nano-heterogenic structure with potential for better mechanical properties and chemical resistance, acid-resistant building materials based on a nanostructured binder, and an advanced environmentally friendly and weather-resistant fire-protective coating for indoor and outdoor application to flammable substrates. With a focus on novel concretes and protective compounds for a variety of environments, this book reflects the newest developments in the rapidly growing field of building materials engineering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:324a072192eebd959ae80371b64321bc6e9086d9","amp;dn":"Advanced+Polymer+Concretes+and+Compounds","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"324a072192eebd959ae80371b64321bc6e9086d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,74,7,33,146,238,189,149,154,232,3,113,182,67,33,188,110,144,134,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
