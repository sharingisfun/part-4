To make this\nnotion very clear in your minds, this course will\nhave as a basic Syntax: the C++ programming language\nas it's one the most useful syntaxes in nowadays\nin addition to java and python. In addition, our\ncourse will focus especially on the use of the OOP concept in\nthe world of applications using the Qt framework, and this is the\nspecialty of this course. through the presented tutorial we\nwill discuss the following notions: -Classes And Objects\nConstructor -Destructor -Accessors -Overloading -pointers\nInheritance -Polymorphism -Static member -Qt And OOP this is\nwhat you've got to learn to get a solid base in OOP. So let's\nget started in this course step by step together and to uncover\nthe world of Object Oriented Programming","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee53614f074843cf906826917990d448df129a05","amp;dn":"UDEMY+C+PLUS+PLUS+OBJECT+ORIENTED+PROGRAMMING+FROM+SCRATCH+TUTOR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee53614f074843cf906826917990d448df129a05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,83,97,79,7,72,67,207,144,104,38,145,121,144,212,72,223,18,154,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
