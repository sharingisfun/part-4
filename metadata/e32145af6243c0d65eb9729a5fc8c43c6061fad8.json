The resolution on the 1080p one is a little weird but thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s because of the massive amount of cropping I had to apply to the blu-ray. Audio is 5.1ch FLAC on both releases, if you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t like then donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t download.\n\nEDIT(resolution explanation):\n\n[21:18:59] (matt) the resolution is\n[21:19:00] (matt) Width : 1 864 pixels\n[21:19:00] (matt) Height : 1 048 pixels\n[21:19:00] (matt) Display aspect ratio : 16:9\n[21:19:14] (matt) thats because of the cropped black bars which are present in the whole movie\n[21:19:19] (matt) normally\n[21:19:26] (matt) there is a much smaller area that needs to be cropped\n[21:19:34] (matt) so people just upsize it to 1920ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€1080\n[21:19:43] (matt) in this case itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s much larger so i left it as is\n\n(source: BSSUBS.NET)\n\nThis is legit guys.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e32145af6243c0d65eb9729a5fc8c43c6061fad8","amp;dn":"%5BBSS%5D_REDLINE_%5B1080p%5D%5B207485B6%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e32145af6243c0d65eb9729a5fc8c43c6061fad8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,33,69,175,98,67,192,214,94,185,114,154,95,200,196,60,96,97,250,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
