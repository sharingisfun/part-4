The \n   main  unit uses  Xils-lab 3rd  generation zero-delay  feedback filter  with \n   self-oscillation in each mode while the second offers a vocal formant  mode \n   in addition to high-pass, band-pass and low-pass modes. \n             \n   Modern instruments : In addition to the cumulative waveforms LFO there  are \n   three D-ADSR envelopes, Oxium includes our brand new Le Masque modulator in \n   its new incarnation with  many additional features :  It has now 16  freely \n   drawable  zones,  horizontal  and   vertical  quantize  modes,  two   level \n   parameters and, of course, you can save, load and exchange your patterns. \n             \n   Intuitive  User Interface  : Oxium  interface is  based on  a new  &quot;Flower&quot; \n   design and IVF (Instant Visual  Feedback) concept. &quot;Flower&quot; design for  the \n   oscillators, filter, LFOs  and glide blocks  means that you  can understand \n   the structure of a  whole block after a  simple glance (IVF), making  Oxium \n   fun,  fast and  easy to  understand and  to master.  In addition,  all the \n   modulations are all handled in a central page, with additional easy  knobs, \n   including usual musical gestures  per patch: It has  never been so easy  to \n   add a Vibrato, a Tremolo or an Auto Wah to your sound. \n             \n   Two skins to fit with your mood. \n             \n   Fully loaded with more  than 250 presets made  by talented and known  sound \n   designers (included Lotuzia, Nori Ubukata, Tzadi, Ingo Weidner, Sami  Rabia \n   &quot;AiynZahev&quot;, Stephen Wey, Simon Ball &quot;Soundsdivine&quot;, Kelvin Ford).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo not make money with this software...\n\nRemember to BUY the stuff if you USE it.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1337x.to - demonoid.ph - fenopy.se - flashtorrents.org\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXIV (11)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4156815ea01c8001a117ddc44670f6fe91640c8c","amp;dn":"XILS-Lab+-+Oxium+v1.0.1+OS+X+%5BAiR%5D%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4156815ea01c8001a117ddc44670f6fe91640c8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,86,129,94,160,28,128,1,161,23,221,196,70,112,246,254,145,100,12,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
