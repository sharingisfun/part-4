Adorno - Aesthetic Theory (Continuum, 2002).  Edited by Gretel Adorno and Rolf Tiedemann; newly translated by Robert Hullot-Kentor.\n\nISBN: 0826467571 | 404 pages | PDF\n\n\nAESTHETIC THEORY is a book by the 20th century German philosopher Theodor Adorno (1903-1969) which was culled from drafts written between 1961 and 1969, and ultimately published posthumously in 1970.  Although anchored by the philosophical study of art, the book is interdisciplinary and incorporates elements of political philosophy, sociology, metaphysics and other philosophical pursuits in keeping with Adorno's boundary-shunning methodology.\n\nSome critics have described the work as Adorno's magnum opus and ranked it among the most important pieces on aesthetics published in the 20th century.  The book retraces the historical evolution of art into its paradoxical state of &quot;semi-autonomy&quot; within capitalist modernity, considering the socio-political implications of this progression.  In Adorno's formulation, &quot;art is the sedimented history of human misery.&quot;\n\nFor more works by Adorno, see:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9004892/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9004892/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd9f8230ee4a2a3736c3204eb81c973e606c0f6a","amp;dn":"Theodor+W.+Adorno+-+Aesthetic+Theory+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd9f8230ee4a2a3736c3204eb81c973e606c0f6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,159,130,48,238,74,42,55,54,195,32,78,184,28,151,62,96,108,15,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
