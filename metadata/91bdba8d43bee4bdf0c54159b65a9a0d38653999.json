After gaining title to the land through fraudulent treaties with the African chiefs and strong-arm diplomacy among the European powers carving up Africa, Leopold II ran the so-called Congo Free State as a private fiefdom. While claiming to bring &quot;civilization&quot; to the Congolese, the Belgian monarch's goals were anything but benevolent.\r\nA latecomer to colonialism, King Leopold II of Belgium searched the world for a satellite to call his very own, finally finding his prey in the Congo region of Africa. Hiding his greed behind the twinned fictions of charity and philanthropy, the king entered the Congo with the help of the explorer Henry Morton Stanley and quickly strong-armed tribal chiefs into signing away their future. Soon after, representatives from Europe and the United States delivered the region --renamed the Congo Free State, later Zaire and now the Democratic Republic of Congo --into Leopold's rapacious care. \r\n&quot;Congo: White King, Red Rubber, Black Death&quot; fills an important void in the history of Europe's disastrous encounters with Africa. Using a combination of interviews with contemporary historians and the recitation of the letters and investigative articles from the late 19th and early 20th century, the film outlines a human rights catastrophe which rivals the genocides created by the likes of Stalin, Hitler and Pol Pot.\r\n\r\nA Film by Peter Bate ; A Periscope Production for the BBC in association with ZDF/ARTE,IKON,VRT,RTBF,History Television,SBS,YLE and DR TV\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d3/Congo-White-King-Red-Rubber-Black-Death-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4e/Congo-White-King-Red-Rubber-Black-Death-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fc/Congo-White-King-Red-Rubber-Black-Death-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/11/Congo-White-King-Red-Rubber-Black-Death-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/82/Congo-White-King-Red-Rubber-Black-Death-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/15/Congo-White-King-Red-Rubber-Black-Death-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f7/Congo-White-King-Red-Rubber-Black-Death-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/46/Congo-White-King-Red-Rubber-Black-Death-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e2/Congo-White-King-Red-Rubber-Black-Death-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d6/Congo-White-King-Red-Rubber-Black-Death-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/36/Congo-White-King-Red-Rubber-Black-Death-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d2/Congo-White-King-Red-Rubber-Black-Death-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c3/Congo-White-King-Red-Rubber-Black-Death-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4d/Congo-White-King-Red-Rubber-Black-Death-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/be/Congo-White-King-Red-Rubber-Black-Death-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/90/Congo-White-King-Red-Rubber-Black-Death-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: 1 848 Kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 720x400\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Per Second: 29.970 fps\r\nAudio Codec: AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate: 448 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\r\nAudio Streams: 2\r\nAudio Languages: english\r\nRunTime Per Part: 1h 30mn\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 1.44 GB\r\nRipped by: DocFreak08\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nSource: \nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Congo:_White_King,_Red_Rubber,_Black_Death","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91bdba8d43bee4bdf0c54159b65a9a0d38653999","amp;dn":"BBC+Storyville+Congo+White+King+Red+Rubber+Black+Death+x264+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91bdba8d43bee4bdf0c54159b65a9a0d38653999","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,189,186,141,67,190,228,189,240,197,65,89,182,90,154,13,56,101,57,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
