The ancient Carpathian had given up hope of finding his lifemate, but now he will do anything to make Charlotte his own. What Tariq doesnÃ¢Â€â„¢t know is that Charlotte is using herself and her best friend as baitâ€”to try to draw out the bloodthirsty killers who have already murdered CharlotteÃ¢Â€â„¢s brother and mentor.\r\n\r\nCharlotte is familiar with Tariq. Not only is he one of the richest and most eligible bachelors in the city, but heÃ¢Â€â„¢s also a renowned collector of old carousel horses, which Charlotte restores. Their shared passion opens Charlotte up to trusting him with her life and with the desire she can no longer control. But it also makes her vulnerable to a centuries-old curse that will unite her and Tariq in a war against the enemies of humans and Carpathians alike..\r\n\r\n=======================================\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/shtihl22\r\n\r\n=======================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db26542bd5713b019ef72209a82e91160cdb9729","amp;dn":"Dark+Carousel+%28Dark+30%29+by+Christine+Feehan+%282016%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db26542bd5713b019ef72209a82e91160cdb9729","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,38,84,43,213,113,59,1,158,247,34,9,168,46,145,22,12,219,151,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
