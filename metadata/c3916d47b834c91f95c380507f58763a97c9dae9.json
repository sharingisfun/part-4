It is often called the Dark Ages for it covered some of the darkest periods in the history of Europe when it was under the absolute dominance of the Church, with suppression of thought and learning. The last 500 years of that period was particularly harsh on Europe for it suffered from continuous wars (the crusades, the 100-year war, ..etc), famine, and plagues (the black death).\n\nMany of the major incidents and the atrocities committed by the Church during the medieval ages were addressed in separate uploads. These include: religious wars, religious persecution, the inquisition, the crusades, war against science and scientists, corruption of the papacy and church, schisms in the church,...etc.\n\nWe have 30 titles in this upload. The emphasis here is on the social, economical and political aspects of the medieval ages.\n\n-  Backman - The Worlds of Medieval Europe (2003)\n\n-  Barber - The Two Cities; Medieval Europe, 1050-1320, 2e (2004)\n\n-  Bell - A History of Feudalism, British and Continental (1863)\n\n-  Berman (Ed.) - Medieval Religion; New Approaches (2005)\n\n-  Byrne - Encyclopedia of the Black Death (2012)\n\n-  Cosman &amp; Jones - Handbook to Life in the Medieval World (2008)\n\n-  dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Avray - Medieval Religious Rationalities; a Weberian Analysis (2010)\n\n-  Davis - Medieval Europe (2010)\n\n-  Davis (Eds.) - Love, Marriage, and Family Ties in the Later Middle Ages (2003)\n\n-  Deane - A History of Medieval Heresy and Inquisition (2011)\n\n-  Emery - Philosophy and Theology in the Long Middle Ages (2011)\n\n-  Evans - Fifty Key Medieval Thinkers (2002)\n\n-  Friedman - Medieval Trinitarian Thought from Aquinas to Ockham (2010)\n\n-  Hanawalt - The Middle Ages; an Illustrated History (1998)\n\n-  Harper &amp; Proctor - Medieval Sexuality; a Casebook (2008)\n\n-  McCarthy - Marriage in Medieval England; Law, Literature, and Practice (2004)\n\n-  Mitchell - Family Life in the Middle Ages (2007)\n\n-  Mortimer - Medieval Intrigue; Decoding Royal Conspiracies (2010)\n\n-  Mundill - The KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Jews; Money, Massacre and Exodus in Medieval England (2010)\n\n-  Nirenberg - Communities of Violence; Persecution of Minorities in the Middle Ages (1996)\n\n-  Otis - Prostitution in Medieval Society; the History of an Urban Institution in Languedoc (1985)\n\n-  Pirenne - Economic and Social History of Medieval Europe (1933)\n\n-  Runciman - The Medieval Manichee; a Study of the Christian Dualist Heresy (1947)\n\n-  Sarris (Eds.) - An Age of Saints; Power, Conflict and Dissent in Early Medieval Christianity (2011)\n\n-  Schaus (Ed.) - Women and Gender in Medieval Europe; an Encyclopedia (2006)\n\n-  Stephenson - Medieval Feudalism (1942)\n\n-  Tuchman - A Distant Mirror; the Calamitous 14th Century (1978)\n\n-  Whalen - Dominion of God; Christendom and Apocalypse in the Middle Ages (2009)\n\n-  Wippel - Medieval Reactions to the Encounter Between Faith and Reason (1995)\n\n-  Wood - Medieval Economic Thought (2004)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3916d47b834c91f95c380507f58763a97c9dae9","amp;dn":"Criticism+of+the+Western+Civilization+-+Collection+25+%28Medieval+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3916d47b834c91f95c380507f58763a97c9dae9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,145,109,71,184,52,201,31,149,195,128,80,127,88,118,58,151,201,218,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
