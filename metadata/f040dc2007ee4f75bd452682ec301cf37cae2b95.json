The band has sold over five million albums worldwide, [4] won four Juno Awards, and won ten MuchMusic Video Awards ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the most MMVAs ever awarded to any artist or group.[5]\n\nOLP has released seven studio albums, one live album, and two compilation albums, with their 1997 album Clumsy often being considered their signature and most widely recognized work to date.[6] They have enjoyed many hit singles, ranging from &quot;Starseed&quot; in 1994, to &quot;Somewhere Out There&quot; in 2002.\n\nWhile the band's first four albums were often praised for their unique sound and style, their fifth album, Gravity, is sometimes noted to have been a &quot;radical departure&quot;[7] from their distinctive style of music and has been criticized as being &quot;too mainstream&quot;.[8] The 2001 departures of both founding member Mike Turner and longtime-producer Arnold Lanni, in combination with influence from then-new producer Bob Rock, are sometimes credited as main factors in the style change.[9]\n\nAfter nearly breaking up during the recording of their sixth studio album Healthy in Paranoid Times in 2005,[4] the band took a prolonged hiatus before releasing their most recent album, Burn Burn, in June 2009.[10][11] In addition to a December 2009 announcement about a 2010 tour that will feature their Clumsy and Spiritual Machines albums in their entireties,[12] the band has confirmed that they will begin recording their eighth album in January 2010. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Decade 2006\n\n\nA Decade is Canadian alternative rock band Our Lady Peace's first compilation album, released on November 21, 2006 in Canada, and November 28, 2006 in the United States.
