Hardy [epub]\r\n\r\nThe detonation of nuclear weapons in the 20th century was not the first time humanity has seen such terrible destruction. Drawing upon the work of Zecharia Sitchin, the Book of Genesis, Sumerian clay tablets, and archaeological evidence such as ancient radioactive skeletons, Chris Hardy reveals the ancient nuclear event that destroyed the Sumerian civilization and the power struggles of the â€œgodsâ€ that led up to it.\r\n\r\nThe author explains how the Anunnaki came to Earth from the planet Nibiru seeking gold to repair their ozone layer. Using genetic engineering, they created modern humanity to do their mining work and installed themselves as our kings and our gods. Anunnaki god Enki had a fatherly relationship with the first two humans. Then Enlil, Enkiâ€™s brother, took over as Commander of Earth, instating a sole-god theocracy and a war against the clan of Enki and humanity for spoiling the Anunnaki bloodlines through interbreeding. This shift imposed a blackout not only of the very human nature of the Anunnaki â€œgodsâ€ but also of humanityâ€™s own ancient past on Earth.\r\n\r\nTwo of Enlilâ€™s attacks against the Enki clan and humanity are described in the stories of the Deluge and the Tower of Babel. His final attempt, after coercing the Assembly of the Gods into voting yes, was the nuclear bombing of 5 cities of the Jordan plain, including Sodom and Gomorrah, which resulted in the destruction of the Sumerian civilization and the Anunnakisâ€™ own civilization on Earth, including their space port in the Sinai. The author reveals how, after each attempt, humanity was saved by Enki, chief scientist Ninmah, and Enkiâ€™s son Hermes.\r\n\r\nThe author explores how the Anunnakisâ€™ reliance on technology and their recurrent wars caused them to lose touch with cosmic consciousness. And she reveals how we will be doomed to repeat this dynamic until humanity awakens to our true origins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75f37298cbf1a34f7e59d1c883c1da42fa1a8618","amp;dn":"Wars+of+the+Annunaki%3A+Nuclear+Self-Destruction+in+Ancient+Sumer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75f37298cbf1a34f7e59d1c883c1da42fa1a8618","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,243,114,152,203,241,163,79,126,89,209,200,131,193,218,66,250,26,134,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
