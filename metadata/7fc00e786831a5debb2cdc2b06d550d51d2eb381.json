Scott Fitzgerald&amp;#039;s Jazz Age classic.  Robert Redford stars as Jay Gatsby, who had once loved beautiful, spoiled Daisy Buchanan (Mia Farrow), then lost her to a rich boy.  But now Gatsby is mysteriously wealthy...and ready to risk everything to woo Daisy back.  A winner of two Academy Awards, The Great Gatsby features a fine supporting cast and an elegant script by Francis Ford Coppola.  And at its center is the opulent evocation of an era of hot jazz and cold champagne, of women as exotic and demanding as hothouse flowers, and of lives made soft by too much, too soon.\n\n\nC O M M E N T S\n\nDisturbing story of idle-rich during the Roaring 20s, 2 October 2004\nAuthor: mdm-11 from Liverpool Twp., Ohio\n\nThis lavish Hollywood treatment of the Classic F. Scott Fitzgerald novel is a visual and acoustic delight. Nelson Riddle&amp;#039;s spellbinding score and the many brilliant camera shots capturing the splendor of an age of excesses and indulgences make for engaging entertainment. Still, the dark story will leave the viewer numb at the eventual (bitter) end. A young Mia Farrow and Robert Redford in the leads, along with excellent performances by Scott Wilson and Bruce Dern, as well as the 70s &quot;femme fatal&quot; staple Karen Black round out the top, with what seems to be hundreds of colorful &quot;flapper&quot; and servant extras in the cast. Everyone fortunate enough to be born or married or mistressed into money is living the &quot;life&quot;, not caring about anyone and anything other than fun, fun, fun.\n\nA series of indiscretions (by just about everyone) culminates in the &quot;just desserts&quot;, and several deaths. The fact that life of the high and mighty seems to go on without skipping a beat, regardless of anyone&amp;#039;s recklessness or involvement, is the tough lesson the author seems to aim for. Without conscience, what have we? All the money will not replace human emotions, though the cash seems to easily take their place. But didn&amp;#039;t we have fun.... \n\n\nBE AWARE OF BOGUS SITES AND LAMERS\n\nENJOY!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fc00e786831a5debb2cdc2b06d550d51d2eb381","amp;dn":"The+Great+Gatsby%5B1974%5DDvDrip%5B720x576%5DAC3%5B6ch%5D%5BEng%5D-RHooD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fc00e786831a5debb2cdc2b06d550d51d2eb381","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,192,14,120,104,49,165,222,187,44,220,43,6,213,80,213,29,46,179,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
