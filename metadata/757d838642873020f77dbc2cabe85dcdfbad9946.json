And imagine a family run shop Ã¢â‚¬â€œ one stretching back for generations Ã¢â‚¬â€œ catering to exactly that urge, selling all the tools and accessories you could possibly need to take your own life in any fashion imaginable. And then imagine the shop-owning familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dismay when a new baby arrives. A happy baby. A baby that makes everyone around him happy. The impact on the family business could be devastating.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1655413/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1655413/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Animation | Comedy | Musical\niMDB Rating: 6,1/10 from 774 users\nDirector: Patrice Leconte\nStarring: Bernard Alane, Isabelle Spade, Kacey Mottet Klein\n\nLanguage : FRENCH\nSub: HC ENGLISH\n\nSource Used: Le magasin des suicides 2012 1080p BluRay DTS x264-Skazhutin","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:757d838642873020f77dbc2cabe85dcdfbad9946","amp;dn":"The+Suicide+Shop+2012+SUBBED+720p+BRRip+x264-PLAYNOW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"757d838642873020f77dbc2cabe85dcdfbad9946","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,125,131,134,66,135,48,32,247,125,188,44,171,232,93,205,251,173,153,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
