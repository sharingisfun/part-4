When an island populated by happy, flightless birds is visited by mysterious green piggies, it's up to three unlikely outcasts - Red, Chuck and Bomb - to figure out what the pigs are up to.\r\n\r\nCPG Note: Reason for V2 are, First its from different source a better one, has no weird watermarks in the middle except one at start but luckily its transparent so no issue there. 2nd it has full audio even for end credit scenes. since they are NO weird watermarks that cover in the middle so that allow me to bright up nicely. stable the colors and add synced new digital audio to it. Enjoyâ€¦\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/SNmWqTVl.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e76ac8feb48b130a44b1ca8834ddc9e4e1edae1","amp;dn":"The.Angry.Birds.Movie.2016.V2.HD-TC.x264.AC3-CPG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e76ac8feb48b130a44b1ca8834ddc9e4e1edae1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,118,172,143,235,72,177,48,164,75,28,168,131,77,220,158,78,30,218,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
