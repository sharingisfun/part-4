The first type drain intelligence, energy, and capability from the ones around them and always need to be the smartest ones in the room. These are the idea killers, the energy sappers, the diminishers of talent and commitment. On the other side of the spectrum are leaders who use their intelligence to amplify the smarts and capabilities of the people around them. When these leaders walk into a room, lightbulbs go off over people's heads, ideas flow, and problems get solved. These are the leaders who inspire employees to stretch themselves to deliver results that surpass expectations. These are the Multipliers. And the world needs more of them, especially now, when leaders are expected to do more with less.\n\nIn this engaging and highly practical book, leadership expert Liz Wiseman and management consultant Greg McKeown explore these two leadership styles, persuasively showing how Multipliers can have a resoundingly positive and profitable effect on organizationsÃ¢â‚¬â€getting more done with fewer resources, developing and attracting talent, and cultivating new ideas and energy to drive organizational change and innovation.\n\nIn analyzing data from more than 150 leaders, Wiseman and McKeown have identified five disciplines that distinguish Multipliers from Diminishers. These five disciplines are not based on innate talent; indeed, they are skills and practices that everyone can learn to useÃ¢â‚¬â€even lifelong and recalcitrant Diminishers. Lively, real-world case studies and practical tips and techniques bring to life each of these principles, showing you how to become a Multiplier too, whether you are a new or an experienced manager. Just imagine what you could accomplish if you could harness all the energy and intelligence around you. Multipliers will show you how.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a38ef40c5d25094ac40f026e75c7415255a423fb","amp;dn":"Multipliers+-+How+the+Best+Leaders+make+Everyone+smarter+%5BQwerty","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a38ef40c5d25094ac40f026e75c7415255a423fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,142,244,12,93,37,9,74,196,15,2,110,117,199,65,82,85,164,35,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
