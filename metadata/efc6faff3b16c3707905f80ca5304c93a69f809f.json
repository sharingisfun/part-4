Not everyone's cup of tea but if you have a classy lady she will really enjoy this. Makes for good dinner music.\n\n- Big Papi\n\n\n\nChristina wrote:\n\nI'll never forget the first time I heard &quot;Con Te Partiro&quot;: standing in the living room before dinner, watching a Bellagio Resort ad, and being completely overwhemlmed by THAT VOICE. It took me another four months to figure out that who that voice belonged to. I'll start by saying flat-out that I ADORE him, so, Bocelli-fans, read further if you wish, or stop reading now and write me off as another knuckle-headed fan. If you're on the fence, BUY THIS CD. The best cuts on album are, of course, &quot;Con Te Partiro&quot;, and then &quot;Il Mare Calmo della Serra&quot; (very atmospheric, very Mediterranean) and &quot;Machina de Guerra&quot;. It's an easy song to get lodged in your head, you'll be humming it all day, trust me.\n\nI can do without the duets. I do not love the sound of Zucchero's voice, it grates against Bocelli's, and I simply can't stand Sarah Brightman. Sorry, I just can't.\n\nI also do not get this pop or opera controversy which Bocelli has generated. Why must we be so pigeon-holed? I play the violin. I play baroque music and when I'm fed up with that I play Appalachian fiddle tunes - anything wrong with that! Why can't he, or anyone else, have success in more than one musical genre? And for those of you who insist that he can't sing, he only started seriously training his voice in his thirties; he's come a long way on just native talent, if you ask me.\n\nBut to the matter at hand, putting aside the duets, this is a gorgeous collection of music, romantic, DIFFERENT.\n\n\n\nAndrea Bocelli - Romanza\n\nArtist...............: Andrea Bocelli\nAlbum................: Romanza\nGenre................: Pop\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1996\n\nFLAC\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 53 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 249kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n\nTracklisting\n\n1.
