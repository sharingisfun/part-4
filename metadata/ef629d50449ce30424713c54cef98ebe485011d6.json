Back when Rock &amp; Roll was up-beat, up-tempo and fun. Long before Drugs and Politics changed the popular culture forever.\n  In 1964, the Beatles had just recently exploded onto the American scene with their debut on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show.&quot; This was the group's first feature and offered fans their first peek into a day in the life of the Beatles. It also served to establish the Fab Four on the silver screen, as well as to inspire the music video format. \n  The sound on the speaking parts is, at times, rather tinny sounding. But the vocals (the singing) are great quality.\n\n  Songs: \n  A Hard Day's Night\n  I'll Cry Instead\n  I Should've Known Better\n  Can't Buy Me Love\n  If I Fell\n  And I Love Her\n  I'm Happy Just to Dance with You\n  Ringo's Theme (This Boy)\n  Tell Me Why\n  Don't Bother Me\n  I Wanna Be Your Man\n  All My Lovin'\n  She Loves You\n\n  Starring: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Ringo Starr.\n\n  Directed by: Richard Lester.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 24min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 632 x 412","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef629d50449ce30424713c54cef98ebe485011d6","amp;dn":"A+Hard+Days+Night+%281964%29+%28The+Beatles%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef629d50449ce30424713c54cef98ebe485011d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,98,157,80,68,156,227,4,36,113,60,84,206,249,142,190,72,80,17,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
