Estevez' son, then 19, fell in love, moved to Spain, and got married a few years later. Since that trip, Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez spoke often of how they could make a film about the pilgrimage until an idea surfaced. \n\nFilmed with a small crew of fifty people and a couple of cameras for filming. No trailers were used, and, as Estevez jokingly remarked, neither was a director's chair. \n\nTom (Martin Sheen) places bits of his son's ashes at various places on El Camino to signify that his son is making the journey with him. Though touching, this goes against Catholic teaching - cremation is allowed, but all of a person's ashes are to be kept together, in one place. Scattering or dividing the ashes is officially not allowed. \n\nProduction of the film took 40 days, and Emilio Estevez's son, who served as an associate producer on the film, met his wife-to-be on the Camino. \n\n\n\n\n\ntorrent name\n\n\nThe Way (2010) 720p BRrip PROPER_scOrp_sujaidr\n\n\n\n\nvideo details\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;b7ffded0dff7fb839987&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 8 frames\nCodec ID                         : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                         : 2h 0mn\nNominal bit rate                 : 886 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                           : 696 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.041\n\naudio details\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                   : HE-AAC / LC\nCodec ID                         : A_AAC\nDuration                         : 2h 0mn\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz / 24.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\n\n\nlanguage                          english\n                      \n\nsubtitle                          english\n\nSAMPLE                  :INCLUDED\n\nthanks to the AWESOME SCORP (BEST RIPPER EVER)\n\nuploader \n sujaidr\n\n\n\nPLOT: &quot;The Way&quot; is a powerful and inspirational story about family, friends, and the challenges we face while navigating this ever-changing and complicated world. Martin Sheen plays Tom, an American doctor who comes to St. Jean Pied de Port, France to collect the remains of his adult son (played by Emilio Estevez), killed in the Pyrenees in a storm while walking the Camino de Santiago, also known as The Way of Saint James. Rather than return home, Tom decides to embark on the historical pilgrimage to honor his son's desire to finish the journey. What Tom doesn't plan on is the profound impact the journey will have on him and his &quot;California Bubble Life&quot;. Inexperienced as a trekker, Tom soon discovers that he will not be alone on this journey. On his journey, Tom meets other pilgrims from around the world, each with their own issues and looking for greater meaning in their lives: a Dutchman (Yorick van Wageningen)... \n\n\nDirector:Emilio Estevez\nStars:          Emilio Estevez, Martin Sheen and Deborah Kara Unger\nimdb: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1441912/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1441912/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nscreenshots\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/C8Wzw.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/C8Wzw.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/f8NBp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/f8NBp.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/W50Mr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/W50Mr.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/IgtAB.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/IgtAB.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n               RECOMMENDED PLAYER TO VIEW THE MOVIES ARE KM PLAYER(i use this)  OR  VLC PLAYER\n\n                \n          MY COMPUTER IS RUNNING NON STOP TO PROVIDE THESE MOVIES SO A SIMPLE THANKS WOULD BE ENOUGH.ITS REALLY SAD THAT MANY DOWNLOAD BUT DONT EVEN RATE OR COMMENT\n\n            DONT HIT AND RUN,SEED BACK.LET OTHERS ENJOY TOO AND YOU ARE GETTING THIS FOR FREE SO ATLEAST SEED BACK    \n\n                                      \n\n\n                       SEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.SHARING IS CARING\n\n                       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED \n\n                         DO COMMENT ON THE QUALITY,IT WONT TAKE MUCH OF YOUR TIME  \n                               CHECK OUT MY OTHER TORRENTS \n\n                                                   \n                                             \n\n                                        TO VISIT MY facebook page to post requests GOOGLE SUJAIDR \n\n\n\nNOTE:due to frequent power cuts,seeding might be interrupted so patience guys and remember to rate,comment,seed AFTER DOWNLOAD and enjoy.\n\nREQUESTS ARE WELCOME AND WILL DO IT WHEN POSSIBLE\n\nafter repeated requests,still there is a lot of hit and run on my torrents.therefore download my movies while i am seeding,get it before the torrent dies\n\n\n\nIF YOU LIKE THE MOVIE THEN DO BUY THE ORIGINAL BLURAY/DVD\n\n\nPRESS THE +1 TO RATE MY TORRENT AS THERE ARE MORONS WHO INTENTIONALLY NEGATIVE RATE MY TORRENTS SO PLEASE SUPPORT ME BY RATIN UP\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:970b52cfeb73fdfe7076c6143f1b57bf09300bee","amp;dn":"The+Way+%282010%29+720p+BRrip+PROPER_scOrp_sujaidr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"970b52cfeb73fdfe7076c6143f1b57bf09300bee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,11,82,207,235,115,253,254,112,118,198,20,63,27,87,191,9,48,11,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
