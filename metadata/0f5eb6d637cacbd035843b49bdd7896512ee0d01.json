The group's name was coined in the late '70s, when James hired them as background singers for his Stone City Band. The Mary Jane Girls (whose name underscored James' fondness for marijuana) soon became an actual group, and in the early '80s were signed to Motown (the R&amp;B powerhouse for which James and his protÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©gÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©e Teena Marie had been recording). With a lineup consisting of Joanne &quot;Jojo&quot; McDuffie (the main singer), Candice &quot;Candi&quot; Ghant, Kim &quot;Maxi&quot; Wuletich, and Ann &quot;Cheri&quot; Bailey, the Mary Jane Girls portrayed various characters James had developed -- while JoJo was the tough street chick and Candi was the glamorous supermodel, Cheri was the cutesy Valley Girl and Maxi was the whip-toting, handcuff-carrying dominatrix in black leather. In 1985, Ann &quot;Cheri&quot; Bailey was replaced by Yvette &quot;Corvette&quot; Marine.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tSoul and R&amp;B\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.All Night Long\n02.Boys\n03.Candy Man\n05.You Are My Heaven\n06.On The Inside\n07.In My House\n08.Break It Up\n09.Wild And Crazy Love\n10.Shadow Lover\n11.Walk Like A Man\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f5eb6d637cacbd035843b49bdd7896512ee0d01","amp;dn":"Mary+Jane+Girls+-+20th+Century+Masters+Best+Of+%282001%29vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f5eb6d637cacbd035843b49bdd7896512ee0d01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,94,182,214,55,202,203,208,53,132,59,73,189,215,137,101,18,238,13,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
