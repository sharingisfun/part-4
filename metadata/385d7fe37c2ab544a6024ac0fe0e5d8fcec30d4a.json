Standing a few feet from President Obama, I warned my fellow citizens of the dangers facing our country and called for a return to the principles that made America great.\n\nMany Americans heard and responded, but our nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decline has continued. Today the danger is greater than ever before, and I have never shared a more urgent message than I do now.\n\nOur growing debt and deteriorating morals have driven us far from the foundersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ intent. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve made very little progress in basic education. Obamacare threatens our health, liberty, and financial future. Media elitism and political correctness are out of control.\n\nWorst of all, we seem to have lost our ability to discuss important issues calmly and respectfully regardless of party affiliation or other differences. As a doctor rather than a politician, I care about what works, not whether someone has an (R) or a (D) after his or her name. We have to come together to solve our problems.\n\nKnowing that the future of my grandchildren is in jeopardy because of reckless spending, godless government, and mean-spirited attempts to silence critics left me no choice but to write this book. I have endeavored to propose a road out of our decline, appealing to every AmericanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decency and common sense.\n\nIf each of us sits back and expects someone else to take action, it will soon be too late. But with your help, I firmly believe that America may once again be Ã¢â‚¬Å“one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSincerely,\n\nBen Carson","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:385d7fe37c2ab544a6024ac0fe0e5d8fcec30d4a","amp;dn":"Ben+Carson+-+One+Nation+-+What+We+Can+All+Do+To+Save+America%27s+F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"385d7fe37c2ab544a6024ac0fe0e5d8fcec30d4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,93,127,227,124,42,181,68,166,2,74,192,254,14,93,143,206,195,13,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
