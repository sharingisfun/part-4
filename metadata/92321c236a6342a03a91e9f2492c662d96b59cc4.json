From the epochal opening of &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; through the absurdly apocalyptic closer, &quot;Desolation Row&quot;, his command of surrealistic language was daring and amazing. As a vocalist, he was rewriting the rules of the game. Jimi Hendrix made note of Mr. Z's technically suspect pitch and decided that he too was a singer. And the backing, though ragged, is precisely right. Is this the essential Dylan album? It's certainly one of them.\n&lt;p&gt;\nNote: This is an mp4 encode of the new &quot;reissue&quot; version of Highway 61 Revisited: Sound is superior, both when it comes the remix itself and the new mp4 standard. You may have to download a plugin to play this, but windows media player usually takes care of that automatically.\n&lt;/p&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92321c236a6342a03a91e9f2492c662d96b59cc4","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Highway+61+Revisited+%28Reissue%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92321c236a6342a03a91e9f2492c662d96b59cc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,50,28,35,106,99,66,160,58,145,233,242,73,44,102,45,150,181,156,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
