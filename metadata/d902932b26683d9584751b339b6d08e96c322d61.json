No Need To Argue\n\nPlaying Time.........: 43:14\n\nNo Need to Argue is an album by The Cranberries released in 1994. \nIt was the band's most successful album, and has sold about 16.7 million copies worldwide. \nIt contains one of the band's most successful singles to date, &quot;Zombie&quot;. \nThe album's mood is darker than that on Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?. \nIt shows a more mature Dolores, writing about war, death, love and disappointment. \nHer voice is clearer, without the previous album's double and triple voice layering. \nIn some of the songs, the band decided to take on a rockier and heavier side, using distortion and increasing the volume. \nThe song &quot;Yeat's Grave&quot; is about W. B. Yeats and quotes one of his poems, No Second Troy. \nThe hit song &quot;Zombie&quot; is about the IRA bombings in 1993 that resulted in the death of two children which is what \nlead singer Dolores O'Riordan claims to have inspired her to write the song.\n\nA FrankFoo Original Rip\n\n\nMultiTracker @ FrankFoo\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d902932b26683d9584751b339b6d08e96c322d61","amp;dn":"The+Cranberries+-+No+Need+To+Argue+%28Flac%29+%5BFrankFoo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d902932b26683d9584751b339b6d08e96c322d61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,2,147,43,38,104,61,149,132,117,27,51,155,109,8,233,108,50,45,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
