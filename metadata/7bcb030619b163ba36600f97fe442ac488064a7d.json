The album opens with a fiery version of &quot;The Kid from Red Bank&quot;; other highlights include &quot;Whirly-Bird&quot; and &quot;Teddy the Toad.&quot; As usual, Count Basie's stride-inflected piano style and the brass section's sudden, sharp stabs help define the band's sound.\n\nThe Complete Atomic Basie isn't just about screaming high notes and blistering scale flourishes though; subtlety and dynamic variety characterize several charts. We hear this best in the reeds' lilting swing on &quot;Midnite Blue,&quot; and in the quiet, mellow groove of &quot;Li'l Darlin'&quot;; the sparseness of the latter's arrangement highlights the often-neglected guitarist Freddie Green's inimitable strumming. One of Basie's finest albums, The Complete Atomic Basie is a swinging gem.\n\nRecorded at Capitol Studios, New York, New York between October 21 &amp; 22, 1957. \n\nPersonnel:\nCount Basie (piano); Joe Williams (vocals); Wendell Culley, Snooky Young, Thad Jones, Joe Newman (trumpet); Henry Coker, Al Grey, Benny Powell (trombone); Marshall Royal, Frank Wess, Eddie &quot;Lockjaw&quot; Davis, Frank Foster, Charles Fowlkes (reeds); Freddie Green (guitar); Eddie Jones (bass); Sonny Payne (drums).\n\n\n\nTracklist\n01.
