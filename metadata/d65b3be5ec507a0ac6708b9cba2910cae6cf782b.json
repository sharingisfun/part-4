With the shift towards elegant, well-constructed sentences, it offers the busy teacher three simple steps to motivate and engage children, through:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ explicit teaching and modelling; \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ over forty practical games and activities;\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ application and improvement within editing and proof reading.\n\nThis book draws on recent research but also is based on many years of classroom practice and a number of case studies. Practical examples develop teachersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ understanding of grammatical terms and progression and show how it is possible to have a significant impact on vocabulary, sentence structure and childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writing in general. A balance is found where skills are explicitly taught but within the context of an exciting and interesting curriculum","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d65b3be5ec507a0ac6708b9cba2910cae6cf782b","amp;dn":"A+Creative+Approach+to+Teaching+Grammar+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d65b3be5ec507a0ac6708b9cba2910cae6cf782b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,91,59,229,236,80,122,10,198,112,139,156,186,41,16,202,230,207,120,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
