Idol first achieved fame in the punk rock era as a member of the band Generation X. Unlike other British punk rock artists, Idol claimed he was inspired by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.\n\nIdol then embarked on a successful solo career, and was a member of the MTV-driven &quot;Second British Invasion&quot; of the United States. A series of music videos for songs such as &quot;Dancing With Myself&quot;, &quot;White Wedding&quot;, &quot;Rebel Yell&quot; and &quot;Eyes Without a Face&quot; made him one of the first MTV stars. Idol continues to tour with guitarist Steve Stevens.\n\nOn 16 February 2010, Idol was announced as one of the acts to play the Download Festival in Donington Park, England. He stated, &quot;With all of these great heavyweight and cool bands playing Download this year, I'm going to have to come armed with my punk rock attitude, Steve Stevens, and all of my classic songs plus a couple of way out covers. Should be fun!&quot; In March 2010, Idol added Camp Freddy guitarist Billy Morrison and drummer Jeremy Colson to his touring line-up.\n\nIn 2012, Idol appeared on the third episode of the BBC Four series, How the Brits Rocked America.\n\nHe is currently recording an album of new material with producer Trevor Horn, and Horn's former Buggles bandmate Geoff Downes.\n\nIdol will go on tour starting in 31 May 2014 through 2015. He has also confirmed that his upcoming studio album will be named Kings &amp; Queens of the Underground, due to be released in October 2014, and the name of two featured songs; &quot;Kings &amp; Queens of the Underground&quot; and &quot;Bitter Pill&quot;.\n\nBilly Idol's self-penned autobiography, &quot;Dancing With Myself&quot;  will be released on October 7, 2014 via Touchstone.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKings &amp; Queens of the Underground is the seventh studio album by English rock vocalist Billy Idol, released on 20 October 2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f16bffadaef800dbad79f3bce4a2b8c04d0d146","amp;dn":"Billy+Idol+-+Kings+%26amp%3B+Queens+Of+The+Underground+%5B2014%5D%5B320+KB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f16bffadaef800dbad79f3bce4a2b8c04d0d146","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,22,191,250,218,239,128,13,186,215,159,59,206,74,43,140,4,208,209,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
