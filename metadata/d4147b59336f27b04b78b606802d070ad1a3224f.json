Yet few swimmers truly understand how to breathe efficiently. Not just to get air, but to integrate breathing seamlessly with the stroke. Breathing is sometimes viewed as a liability or inconvenience, but when you do it right, breathing can actually make your stroke better. This video shows you how.\n\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction - Learn the two key skills of breathing: (1) Head-Spine Alignment and (2) Breathing with body movement.\n\nWater Bowl Exercises - Invaluable if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve never been comfortable in water. Useful for understanding subtleties you probably missed before, if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re already a skilled swimmer.\n\nShallow Water Exercises - Separate critical breathing skills from stroking. Rehearse them in simple ways. Breathe more efficiently as a result.\n\nBreathing Skills in Drills - A simple breathing technique that helps you drill better. And an advanced breathing technique that helps you transition from drill to swim better.\n\nWhole Stroke Breathing Skills - A detailed study with focal points for practice of breathing technique for Freestyle, Breaststroke and Butterfly.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4147b59336f27b04b78b606802d070ad1a3224f","amp;dn":"O2+in+H2O+-+A+Self-Help+Course+on+Breathing+in+Swimming.m4v","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4147b59336f27b04b78b606802d070ad1a3224f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,20,123,89,51,111,39,176,75,120,182,6,128,45,7,10,209,163,34,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
