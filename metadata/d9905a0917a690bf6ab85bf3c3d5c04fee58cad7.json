But with the release of stunning new album Collide With The Sky, the San Diego natives are truly en fuego. Deploying every shred of musical prowess in their artillery, Pierce The Veil have poured heart and soul into new album Collide With The Sky - and it shows. Blending the unique vocal style of singer Vic Fuentes, incendiary guitar lines and soaring melody, the band's third album is an aural exploration that at once both packs a punch, while finding the pockets of calm in the chaos - a talent that has made the band such a refreshingly exhilarating force in the scene.\n\n- Track List\n\n1.
