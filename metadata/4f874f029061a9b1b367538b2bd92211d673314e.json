I included two separate\nnosteam clients in this release so you should be able to join them all without\nhaving to worry about which nosteam version the server is. If you want to play in regular\nSteam-only servers, you need to buy the game.\n\nI also included a separate dedicated server setup, in case you want to start your\nown dedicated LAN game with your friends, or start your own server on the internet.\nThe server is already setup to accept all nosteam clients.\n\nIf you are new to Counter-Strike, read the NFO it includes lots of sites you can\nfind support and information at.\n\n==============================================\n\nThis torrent is tracked by a variety of public trackers so it should be working for a long time.\n\nScreens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img29.imageshack.us/img29/8516/p471.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img29.imageshack.us/img29/8516/p471.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img338.imageshack.us/img338/3818/p472.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img338.imageshack.us/img338/3818/p472.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img140.imageshack.us/img140/8454/p473.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img140.imageshack.us/img140/8454/p473.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n==============================================\n\nCounter-Strike 1.6 client 1: Protocol 47 v32, for playing on older, p47 nonsteam servers, and dual-protocol nonsteam servers.\n-627mb unpacked\n-Working CZ style bots\n-Working favorites in server browser\n-Server browser with Setti masterserver (huge list of online nosteam servers)\n-Clean, loads quickly, and works fairly well with Steam\n-Works on all p47 nonsteam servers using older patches, and most dual protocol servers\n\nCounter-Strike 1.6 client 2: Protocol 48 v42, for playing on newer p48 nonsteam servers, and dual-protocol nonsteam servers.\n-539mb unpacked\n-Working CZ style bots\n-Working favorites in server browser\n-Server browser with Setti masterserver (huge list of online nosteam servers)\n-Clean, loads quickly, and works fairly well with Steam\n-Works on all dual protocol servers, as well as specific p48 servers\n-Works on Vista/7 (see NFO)\n\nThe server uses the latest dual protocol patch, and will support all nosteam clients, as well as steam players.\n-338mb unpacked\n-Windows server\n-Uses Crock's dproto 0.34 nosteam patch\n-Includes AmxModX 1.8.1\n-HLDS v4554 fully updated, protects against fake players bugs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f874f029061a9b1b367538b2bd92211d673314e","amp;dn":"Counter-Strike+1.6+NoSteam+%5Bwith+BOTS%5D+LAN+%2B+online%2C+full+p47%2Bp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f874f029061a9b1b367538b2bd92211d673314e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,135,79,2,144,97,169,177,179,103,83,139,43,217,34,17,214,115,49,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
