But after a wild night at the hottest club in downtown Raleigh, North Carolina, she shocks everyone-including herself-when she decides to leave the only life she's ever known and set out on her own. Grabbing her purse and her cell phone, Camryn boards a Greyhound bus ready to find herself. Instead, she finds Andrew Parrish. Sexy and exciting, Andrew lives life like there is no tomorrow. He persuades Camryn to do things she never thought she would and shows her how to give in to her deepest, most forbidden desires. Soon he becomes the center of her daring new life, pulling love and lust and emotion out of her in ways she never imagined possible. But there is more to Andrew than Camryn realizes. Will his secret push them inseparably together-or destroy them forever?\nUnabridged.\n\n-------------------------------\nVisit us for this and more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws\n-------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4aeb8d4d73122b94b9f1e37f6f4e98bff66ee36a","amp;dn":"The+Edge+of+Never+-+J.+A.+Redmerski","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4aeb8d4d73122b94b9f1e37f6f4e98bff66ee36a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,235,141,77,115,18,43,148,185,241,227,127,111,78,152,191,246,110,227,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
