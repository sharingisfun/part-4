It dropped out of contact and disappeared, never reaching its destination.\n\nThousands of years later, it has finally been found.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Analogue is a sit-up-and-take-notice achievement in storytelling, in interface, in research, in mechanics and in moral ambiguity.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Alec Meer, Rock Paper Shotgun\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“It was like watching a horror movie, knowing what was about to happen and curious only how awful the directorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s willing to get. Love is not gratuitous but doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t disappoint Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the fate of the Mugunghwa, and the event that precipitated it, is as valid as it is appalling.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Matt Sakey, Tap-Repeatedly\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A visually stunning game with an interesting story... this game stands as an example of how a text adventure can look and feel nowadays.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€IndieCade, 2012 Finalist\n\nUncover the mystery of what happened to the final generation aboard the generation ship Mugunghwa by reading through its dead crew's logs, with the help of a spunky AI sidekick!\n\nTwo pursuable characters. Five endings. A dark visual novel that further extends the non-linear style of Digital: A Love Story in a mystery featuring transhumanism, traditional marriage, loneliness, and cosplay.\n\nWelcome to the future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e96c4275f3e1113fbb614acda9e5855fb4370e15","amp;dn":"Analogue+A+hate+story","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e96c4275f3e1113fbb614acda9e5855fb4370e15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,108,66,117,243,225,17,63,187,97,74,205,169,229,133,95,180,55,14,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
