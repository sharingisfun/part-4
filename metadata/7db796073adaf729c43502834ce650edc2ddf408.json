Continuing to grow musically and put out quality material is what separates many a band from being classified a Ã¢â‚¬Å“flash in the panÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or becoming one that has a long and storied career, usually resulting in a greatest hits collection somewhere along the way. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the hard truth, but the Ã¢â‚¬Å“what have you done for me latelyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ rule rings true for anyone trying to make their way through the cruel music industry of late. Building on a successful career and living up to the expectations of putting out another quality album is the challenge facing any and all headlining bands, and with the release of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Notes From The ShadowsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, ASTRAL DOORS have met the challenge head on. In August, they are set to unleash their astounding piece of Power-Metal magic that should prove to the world that these guys are here for the long haul and strengthen their status as one of the most talented metal bands on the planet.\n5 Star Rating\nTracklist:\n1.
