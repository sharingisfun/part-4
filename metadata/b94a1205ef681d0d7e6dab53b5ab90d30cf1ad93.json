We are led to believe that if we could only look perfect and lead perfect lives, we'd no longer feel inadequate. So most of us perform, please, and perfect, all the while thinking, &quot;What if I can't keep all of these balls in the air? Why isn't everyone else working harder and living up to my expectations? What will people think if I fail or give up? When can I stop proving myself?&quot;\n\nIn her ten guideposts, Brown engages our minds, hearts, and spirits as she explores how we can cultivate the courage, compassion, and connection to wake up in the morning and think, &quot;No matter what gets done and how much is left undone, I am enough,&quot; and to go to bed at night thinking, &quot;Yes, I am sometimes afraid, but I am also brave. And, yes, I am imperfect and vulnerable, but that doesn't change the truth that I am worthy of love and belonging.&quot;\n\n&quot;This important book is about the lifelong journey from 'What will people think?' to 'I am enough.' Brown's unique ability to blend original research with honest storytelling makes reading The Gifts of Imperfection like having a long, uplifting conversation with a very wise friend who offers compassion, wisdom, and great advice.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Harriet Lerner, New York Times best-selling author of The Dance of Anger and The Dance of Connection\n\n&quot;BrenÃƒÂ© Brown courageously tackles the dark emotions that get in the way of leading a fuller life; read this book and let some of that courage rub off on you.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Daniel H.
