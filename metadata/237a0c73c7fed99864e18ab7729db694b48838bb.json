Formed in 1969, \nWar was the first and most successful musical crossover, fusing elements of \nrock, funk, jazz, Latin music, R&amp;B, and even reggae. The band also transcended \nracial and cultural barriers with a multi-ethnic line-up. The band's diverse \nmusical influences have made it an enduring influence, one that has sold over \n50 million records to date. Although War's lyrics are often socio-political in \nnature, their music usually had a laid-back, California funk vibe. The music \nhas been sampled and recorded by many singers and groups, ranging from Janet \nJackson to Korn to TLC.\n\n                                 \nDisc #1\n\n01 War - Spill the Wine.mp3            \n11 War - Low Rider.mp3\n02 War - Tobacco Road.mp3              \n03 War - All Day Music.mp3 \n04 War - Slippin' Into Darkness.mp3    \n05 War - The World Is a Ghetto.mp3  \n06 War - The Cisco Kid.mp3             \n07 War - City, Country, City.mp3       \n08 War - Gypsy Man.mp3   \n09 War - Me and Baby Brother.mp3\n10 War - Why Can't We Be Friends.mp3 \n12 War - Summer.mp3        \n13 War - Galaxy 2000.mp3  \n14 War - Outlaw.mp3\n15 War - You Got the Power.mp3\n16 War - East L.A.mp3           \n              \nRemix Disc #2\n\n01 War - Slippin' Into Darkness (Armand Van Helden remix).mp3\n02 War - Low Rider (Ganja Kru remix).mp3\n03 War - Galaxy 2000 (Plump DJs remix).mp3\n04 War - Outlaw (Orinoko remix).mp3\n05 War - You Got the Power (Peter Reis remix).mp3\n06 War - The World Is a Ghetto (La Pozze Latina remix).mp3\n07 War - Why Can't We Be Friends (Hithunter remix).mp3\n08 War - Tobacco Road (Soundprops remix).mp3\n\n\n               26 Files      296,944,640\n\n\nDo I really have to ask you to share this?
