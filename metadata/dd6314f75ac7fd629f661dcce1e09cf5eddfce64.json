A totalitarian global military government is established to continue the war effort.\n\nThe film follows Spencer Olham (Gary Sinise)Ã¢â‚¬â€a designer of top secret government weapons. He is arrested by the military, led by Major Hathaway, on the suspicion of being a replicant created by the hostile aliens. The replicants are perfect biological copies of existing humans, complete with transplanted memories... and do not know they are replicants. Each has a small organic nuclear bomb in its chest where the heart should be and they are programed to detonate when they are in close proximity to their target.\n\nWritten by \tPhilip K. Dick (short story)\nStarring \tGary Sinise, Madeleine Stowe, Vincent D'Onofrio\n\nNOTE: One of my favored SF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd6314f75ac7fd629f661dcce1e09cf5eddfce64","amp;dn":"Impostor.2001.BluRay.720p.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd6314f75ac7fd629f661dcce1e09cf5eddfce64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,99,20,247,90,199,253,98,159,102,29,204,225,224,156,245,237,223,206,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
