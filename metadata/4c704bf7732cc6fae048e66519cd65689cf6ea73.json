In this vein, &quot;Bluey&quot; Maunick celebrated Incognito's 30th birthday on stage at the London INDIGO2 with a thrilling concert in summer 2009.\nIt was a fantastic night: with their blend of soul and jazz, funk and fusion almost 30 musicians, with several surprise guest appearances, electrified the audience. Thanks to the contagious energy and the virtuoso solo numbers, each song became something special. And as if this band hadn't given us enough variety already, the strings of the Millennia Ensemble provided a delightful additional interplay of sound. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c704bf7732cc6fae048e66519cd65689cf6ea73","amp;dn":"Incognito+-+Live+In+London+%5Bmp3-192-2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c704bf7732cc6fae048e66519cd65689cf6ea73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,112,75,247,115,44,198,250,224,72,230,101,25,205,101,104,156,246,234,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
