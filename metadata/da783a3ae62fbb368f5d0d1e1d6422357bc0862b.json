The album was named after a line uttered by frontman J. Mascis while on tour with the band.\n\nIn 2005, it was ranked 31 in Spin's &quot;100 Greatest Albums, 1985-2005&quot;. &quot;Poledo&quot; is unique from the rest of the album in that half of it is a lo-fi recording of Lou Barlow singing and playing ukulele, much like his own group Sebadoh, while the other half is a collection of sound collages and abstract noise pieces.\n\nThe album was originally issued when the band were still known as Dinosaur, before a lawsuit forced the name change to Dinosaur Jr. The album was recalled by SST a few months after release, and new copies were printed crediting the band as Dinosaur Jr.\n\nIn 2005 the album was performed live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow's Parties-curated Don't Look Back series.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/B000000M27.01._SS500_SCLZZZZZZZ_V1124917651_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/B000000M27.01._SS500_SCLZZZZZZZ_V1124917651_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTitolo: You're Living All Over Me\nAnno: prima edizione 1987 seconda 2005\nGenere: alternative\nEtichetta:SST, 1987 - Merge, 2005\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\n01.
