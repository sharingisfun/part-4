Included on LP at the last minute -- the first pressings didn't list the song on the album cover -- &quot;I'll Be There for You&quot; received saturation radio airplay, topping the adult contemporary charts, yet it was never released as a single, forcing fans of the song to buy the entire album to own the song. While the Monkees guitar riffs and layered harmonies are not entirely representative of the Rembrandts -- it makes them out to be a bubblegum band -- the record is filled with smart, hook-laden guitar pop that won't disappoint old Rembrandts fans or listeners attracted by the hit. -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine \n \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.End of the beginning [04:32] \n 02.Easy to forget [04:25] \n 03.My own way [04:07] \n 04.Don't hide your love [04:19] \n 05.Drowning in your tears [04:34] \n 06.This house is not A home [03:17] \n 07.April 29 [04:35] \n 08.Lovin' me insane [04:01] \n 09.There goes lucy [03:37] \n 10.As long as I am breathing [04:37] \n 11.Call me [04:03] \n 12.Comin' home [04:07] \n 13.What will it take [04:43] \n 14.The other side of night [04:09] \n 15.I'll be there for you [03:09] \n ____ \n \n 62:15 min \n 92,3 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:444d70a676796ea308fa10ef97f9506aa5b08085","amp;dn":"The_Rembrandts-LP-%28Retail%29-1995-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"444d70a676796ea308fa10ef97f9506aa5b08085","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,77,112,166,118,121,110,163,8,250,16,239,151,249,80,106,165,176,128,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
