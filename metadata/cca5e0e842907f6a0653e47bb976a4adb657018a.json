This album is a great introduction to the Blue Note label and their incredible library of music, in fact there are probably enough great Blue Note tunes for another equally good compilation. New jazz converts will appreciate being able to use this as an introduction to the various artists.\nWith 20 classic tracks included on the two discs there is plenty of music to keep your fingers tapping. The songs are thoughtfully chosen and ordered so that it feels less like a compilation album and more like a mix. This means that even more seasoned jazz listeners will appreciate being able to slip in a couple of discs and get a couple of hours of great music without having to try and create their own mix\n\n\n\nTracklist:\nDisc: 1       \n1.
