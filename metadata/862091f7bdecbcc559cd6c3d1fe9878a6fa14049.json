What he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t realize is that once he holds the beaten lass in his arms, his heart will never be the same. He vows revenge for the abuse she was forced to endure and yearns to make the sweet woman with an iron will his, but can he help her fight the demons in her mind left behind by her abusersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ horrid treatment?\n\n\n\nBook 2:\nHEALING A HIGHLANDERÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S HEART: Brenna and Quade\n\nKidnapped at knifepoint in the middle of the night, healer Brenna Grant is spirited across the Highlands to heal a chieftain whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s near death. The last thing she expects is for her patient to be a handsome laird who steals her heart. Unable to deny himÃ¢â‚¬â€or anyone who needs her talents as a healerÃ¢â‚¬â€she travels to his clan to treat a mysterious invalid.\n\nQuade Ramsay awakens to find a beautiful healer at his bedside. He is powerless to fight his attraction to the lass who saved his life, but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vowed never to fall in love again. Convinced a family curse hangs over his head, he fights his feelings for Brenna. But the very woman he is determined to stay away from might be the only one who can save his young daughter. Will he let the beautiful healer mend his own broken heart?\n\n\n\nBook 3:\nLOVE LETTERS FROM LARGS: Brodie and Celestina\n\nAfter enduring years of her nobleman fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cruelty and abuse, Celestina Lunde is ready to take her own life rather than enter into an arranged marriage with an equally brutal man. But just when she is about to leap through the window of her tower bedroom, a brawny Highland warrior arrives at her home and changes everythingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\nSummoned to the royal castle by the King of the Scots, who is preparing for war with the Norse, Brodie GrantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mind is on battle when he first spies the breathtaking Celestina perched on a window ledge. The sadness in her eyes makes him turn his horse around against his lairdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s orders. He intends only to save the lovely lass, but after touching her once, he can think of nothing and no one else. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one problem: CelestinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intended is an important man, and the king has just as much at stake in her arranged marriage as her father does. Will Brodie be able to do as heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ordered and stay away? \n\nA testament to loveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to transcend the most harrowing of obstacles, Love Letters from Largs is the emotional story of two soul mates who are determined to be together when everyone around them seems intent on pulling them apart.\n\n\n\nBook 4:\nJOURNEY TO THE HIGHLANDS: Robbie and Caralyn\n\nCaptain Robbie Grant has always had a way with the lasses, but his warriorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heart is too married to the battlefield to seek out a wife. Then Robbie saves a mysterious beauty from a Norse attacker. He knows little about Caralyn Crauford beyond that she has a damaged past and two wee daughters, but he volunteers to bring her and the lasses to a priory where they will be safe from the oncoming battle. The last thing he expects is for Caralyn to give him a night of unrestrained passion and then disappear. But when she does, he is determined to find her.\n\nAfter spending years under the thumb of men who cared only about her comeliness, Caralyn no longer knows who she is or why she matters. The only thing she cares about is the welfare of her daughters. But when Captain Robbie Grant enters her life, she dares to want something more. At first sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just grateful to the handsome Highlander, but his noble nature and kind heart endear her to him. The night they spend together only confuses her more, but Caralyn has no time to sort through her feelings because her past rears its ugly head and threatens to ruin her.\n\nRobbie will stop at nothing to rescue Caralyn and her lasses and bring them to the safety of the Highlands, but will Caralyn be able to heal the wounds of her past enough to let herself be loved?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:862091f7bdecbcc559cd6c3d1fe9878a6fa14049","amp;dn":"Clan+Grant+books+1%2C2%2C3%26amp%3B4+by+Keira+Montclair+epub+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"862091f7bdecbcc559cd6c3d1fe9878a6fa14049","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,32,145,247,189,236,188,197,89,205,108,61,31,233,135,138,111,161,64,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
