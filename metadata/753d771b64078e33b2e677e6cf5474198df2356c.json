Fueled by the fury of punk rock and radical political theory, Gang of Four successfully welded the two in an inspired display of polemics and music that addressed the vagaries of life in the modern world (including love and romance) as matters of political inquiry. Despite the fact that this sounds rife with the potential for being long on rhetoric and short on groove, such was not the case. What made Gang of Four's polemical clang'n'roll so compelling was that it worked as harsh, bracing, and ultimately liberating rock &amp; roll. With Allen and Burnham combining as a formidable and frequently very funky rhythm section, Gill didn't play guitar as much as emit thick wads of semi-tuneful distortion, while King &quot;sang&quot; in a dry, declamatory fashion similar to that of the Fall's Mark E. Smith. The rhythms were stripped down and jagged; at times Gill would dispense with guitar solos entirely and &quot;play&quot; non-solos, which were (surprise!) silence. Song titles sounded like the titles of radical political essays: &quot;At Home He's a Tourist,&quot; &quot;Damaged Goods,&quot; &quot;It's Her Factory,&quot; &quot;Anthrax,&quot; &quot;To Hell with Poverty,&quot; all of it openly challenging the audience's preconceived notions about rock music, performance, the cult of celebrity, and the nature of politics. And in doing so, GOF conveyed rage, confusion, and loss of identity as well as any band of their time. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tAlternative\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tEMI Europe\nOriginal Date:\t\t1981\t\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Paralysed\n02.What We All Want\n03.Why Theory\n04.If I Could Keep It For Myself\n05.Outside The Trains Don't Run On Time\n06.Cheeseburger\n07.The Republic\n08.In The Ditch\n09.A Hole In The Wallet\n10.He'd Send In The Army\n11.To Hell With Poverty!\n12.Capital (It Fails Us Now)\n13.History's Bunk!\n14.Cheeseburger (Live)\n15.What We All Want (Live)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:753d771b64078e33b2e677e6cf5474198df2356c","amp;dn":"Gang+Of+Four+-+Solid+Gold+%282004%29+Mp3+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"753d771b64078e33b2e677e6cf5474198df2356c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,61,119,27,100,7,142,51,178,230,119,230,207,84,116,25,141,242,53,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
