Thornhill, an advertising executive who is mistaken by enemy spies for a U.S. undercover agent named George Kaplan. Convinced these sinister fellows (James Mason as the boss, and Martin Landau as his henchman) are trying to kill him, Roger flees and meets a sexy Stranger on a Train (Eva Marie Saint), with whom he engages in one of the longest, most convolutedly choreographed kisses in screen history. And, of course, there are the famous set pieces: the stabbing at the United Nations, the crop-duster plane attack in the cornfield (where a pedestrian has no place to hide), and the cliffhanger finale atop the stone faces of Mount Rushmore.\n\n  Starring: Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason.\n\n  Directed by: Alfred Hitchcock.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 2hr. 11min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 448","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af94f82555b3d48322601cc09ff150f0d232209c","amp;dn":"North+by+Northwest+%281959%29+%28Cary+Grant%2C+Eva+Marie+Saint%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af94f82555b3d48322601cc09ff150f0d232209c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,148,248,37,85,179,212,131,34,96,28,192,159,241,80,240,210,50,32,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
