It\n\nconveys the spirit and the exciting history of the competition as well as an\n\noutline of all original problems and solutions that have been created for the\n\ncontest over 20 years mostly by the author. Some of the problems were inspired\n\nby Russian mathematical folklore; for example, the 1989 Sugar Cubed problem was\n\nwritten in a pleasant Lewis Carroll-like story. Other entertaining problems\n\ninvolve Olde Victorian Map Colourings, King Authur and the Knights of the Round\n\nTable, Crawford Cowboy Had a Farm, Santa Claus and his elves painting the plane,\n\netc.\n\n\nThe twenty &quot;Further Explorations&quot; form a unique feature, not found in any\n\nother Olympiad book: each exploration takes off a solved Olympiad problem and\n\nleads the reader to the forefront of mathematics. These bridges allow young\n\nmathematicians to engage in mathematical research all of their own. Part V of\n\nthe book gives the microphone to the winners, who describe the role of this\n\nOlympiad in their lives and share their successful careers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1fcf5c03a848961b0903c82319db629e041462a","amp;dn":"The+Colorado+Mathematical+Olympiad+...+-+Alexander+Soifer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1fcf5c03a848961b0903c82319db629e041462a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,252,245,192,58,132,137,97,176,144,60,130,49,157,182,41,224,65,70,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
