First broadcast on PBS, this was Burns' ninth documentary.\n\nBaseball is similar to Burns' previous documentaries such as The Civil War, in the use of archived pictures and film footage mixed with interviews for visual presentation. Actors provide voice over reciting written work (letters, speeches, etc.) over pictures and video. The episodes are interspersed with the music of the times taken from previous Burns series, original played music, or recordings ranging from Louis Armstrong to Elvis Presley. The series was narrated by journalist John Chancellor, best known as the anchor of NBC Nightly News between 1970 and 1982.\n\nThe documentary is divided into nine parts, each referred to as an &quot;inning&quot;, following the division of a baseball game. Each &quot;inning&quot; reviews a particular era in time, and begins with a brief prologue that acts as an insight to the game during that era. The prologue ends with the playing of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; just as a real baseball game would begin, with the particular rendition played as it might have been in the era being covered in that inning. While covering the 1960s, the rendition of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; used is the version played by Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock. In some &quot;inning&quot; episodes, a period version of the baseball anthem &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; is used. Before the main feature, a brief preview and the events of the time of the &quot;inning&quot; to come follows.\n\nMajor themes explored throughout the documentary are those of race, business, labour relations, and the relationship between baseball and society. The series had an audience of 45 million viewers, which makes it the most watched program in Public Television history.\n\nThe Nine Innings\n\n1st Inning - Our Game\n\nThis inning serves as an introduction to the game and the series, and covers baseball's origins and the game as it evolved prior to the twentieth century.\nOriginal airdate: Sunday, September 18, 1994.\n\n2nd Inning - Something Like A War\n\nThis inning covers approximately 1900 to 1910, and includes the formation of the American League and its integration with the National League, culminating in the establishment of the World Series. Ty Cobb is discussed in depth (the title of this inning comes from one of his many quotes). Many of the quotes used in this inning and of the other early innings are taken from Lawrence S. Ritter's The Glory of Their Times. - Original airdate: Monday, September 19, 1994.\n\n3rd Inning - The Faith of Fifty Million People\n\nThis inning covers approximately 1910 to 1920. It heavily focuses on the Black Sox Scandal, taking its title from a line in the novel The Great Gatsby. The line refers to how easy it was for gamblers to tamper with the faith that people put in the game's fairness.\nOriginal airdate: Tuesday, September 20, 1994.\n\n4th Inning - A National Heirloom\n\nThis inning covers approximately 1920 to 1930, and focuses on baseball's recovery from the Black Sox Scandal, giving much of the credit to the increase in power hitting throughout the game, led by its savior Babe Ruth. The title comes from what sports writers called Ruth. During an interview given to MLB Network during the series' re-airing in 2009, Burns stated that he originally wanted to title the 4th Inning, &quot;That Big Son-of-a-Bitch&quot;, a name given to Ruth by many in the game during that era.\nOriginal airdate: Wednesday, September 21, 1994.\n\n5th Inning - Shadow Ball\n\nThis inning covers approximately 1930 to 1940. While Burns has not shied away from discussing the plight of African-Americans up to this point, a great deal of this inning covers the Negro Leagues, and the great players and organizers who were excluded from the Major Leagues. Also the episode deals with organized Baseball's response to the Great Depression.\nOriginal airdate: Thursday, September 22, 1994.\n\n6th Inning - The National Pastime\n\nThis inning covers approximately 1940 to 1950. The emphasis here is on baseball finally becoming what it had always purported to be: A national game. As African-Americans are finally permitted for good into Major League Baseball, led by Jackie Robinson. This inning also looks at how the game was influenced as a result of World War II.\nOriginal airdate: Sunday, September 25, 1994.\n\n7th Inning - The Capital of Baseball\n\nThis inning covers approximately 1950 to 1960. Burns emphasizes the greatness of the three teams based in New York (the New York Yankees, the New York Giants, and Brooklyn Dodgers). This inning also covers the major changes that are coming to baseball as teams begin to relocate.\nOriginal airdate: Monday, September 26, 1994.\n\n8th Inning - A Whole New Ballgame\n\nThis inning covers approximately 1960 to 1970. As the nation underwent turbulent changes, baseball was not immune. Expansion and labor are major topics in this inning.\nOriginal airdate: Tuesday, September 27, 1994.\n\n9th Inning - Home\n\nThe final inning covers approximately 1970 to 1993. While baseball survived the 1960s, the changes were not over, and in some ways its most bitter conflicts were just beginning. Major topics include the formation of the players' union, the owners' collusion, free agency, and drug scandals. The documentary ends with an ironic boast that baseball (and indirectly the World Series) had survived wars, depressions, pandemics, and numbers of scandals and thus could never be stopped. The 1994 World Series, the series to be played the year the film first aired on PBS, was canceled due to a players' strike. This marked the first time since 1904 that the World Series was not played. It also focuses on the first non-American team to win the World Series, the Toronto Blue Jays, and the first win by a black manager, Cito Gaston.\nOriginal airdate: Wednesday, September 28, 1994.\n\n10th Inning - The Tenth Inning\n\nThe Tenth Inning premiered on PBS on September 28, 2010. The Inning was broken into two halves airing on September 28 and 29, 2010 and October 5, 2010. The documentary discussed the major stories of the last fifteen years in baseball. It focuses heavily on examining Barry Bonds and the Steroid era but also discusses other major issues in baseball, such as how baseball rebounded from the 1994 strike, the return to prominence of the Yankees, the influence of international players (specifically Dominican and Japanese players) on the game, and the drama of the 2003 and 2004 American League Championship Series\n\n\nALSO INCLUDED - \n\nBASEBALL - The soundtrack Album (1994 - mp3)\n\nTake Me Out to the Ballgame - A History of Baseball in America - Timothy B.
