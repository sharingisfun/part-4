A mysterious man named Django (Franco Nero) arrives in a Mexican border town dragging a small coffin behind him. When he attempts to save a woman who is being attacked by a group of bandits, he finds himself in the middle of a conflict between Mexican gangsters and racist Yankee thugs, with the innocent townspeople and a fortune in Mexican gold stuck somewhere in between. Django becomes a force to be reckoned with when it's discovered his coffin actually contains a Gatling gun. Django proved so popular in Europe that over 30 sequels and follow-ups were produced, though Franco Nero would not return to the role until 1987's Django 2: Il Grande Ritorno (the only sequel endorsed by Corbucci), which proved to be the last film in the series.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Franco Nero, JosÃ© Canalejas, JosÃ© BÃ³dalo\r\nDIRECTOR......: Sergio Corbucci\r\nWRITER........: Sergio Corbucci, Bruno Corbucci\r\nGENRE.........: Western\r\nRATING........: 7.3/10  18,867 votes\r\nIMDB link.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060315\r\nRUNTIME.......: 1h 31mn\r\nSIZE..........: 3.84GiB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264 (  )\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1764x1064\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 1.66:1\r\nBITRATE.......: 5500 Kbps (CRF)\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO1........: Italian DTS 1.0 255kbps\r\nAUDIO2........: English DTS 1.0 255kbps\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG\r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nSOURCE........: Django.1966.Blu-ray.Remux.1080p [Blue Underground]\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2016-07-01","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d284c9cbb0f08d5ca077dabc8b1ecc56a4aa95e","amp;dn":"Django.1966.1080p.BluRay.x264.DTS-SARTRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d284c9cbb0f08d5ca077dabc8b1ecc56a4aa95e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,40,76,156,187,15,8,213,202,7,125,171,200,177,236,197,106,74,169,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
