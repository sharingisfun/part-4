It shows how object-oriented programming can be used to implement a symbolic algebra system and how this can then be applied to different areas in mathematics and physics. This second revised edition:- * Explains the new powerful classes that have been added to Symbolic C++. * Includes the Standard Template Library. * Extends the Java section. * Contains useful classes in scientific computation. * Contains extended coverage of Maple, Mathematica, Reduce and MuPAD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70ae6ad71cf56a536de3ddcab258ec030e1eeb55","amp;dn":"SymbolicC%2B%2B%3A+An+Introduction+to+Computer+Algebra+using+Object-Or","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70ae6ad71cf56a536de3ddcab258ec030e1eeb55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,174,106,215,28,245,106,83,109,227,221,202,178,88,236,3,14,30,235,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
