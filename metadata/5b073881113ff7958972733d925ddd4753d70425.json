There is no doubt that you're being watched. By whom and by what type of life form is not determined. Even Spock has not been able to accurately assess this data. The occurrences are just too strange.\n\nStar TrekÃ¢â€žÂ¢: Judgment Rites, a sequel to Star TrekÃ¢â€žÂ¢: 25th Anniversary, brings you back as Captain James T. Kirk along with your entire crew, as the 5 year Mission continues with 8 new, thought-provoking episodes. The tension increases as you beam down to mysterious worlds and encounter strange adversaries in situations that simply defy logic. Is that truly an ancient WWI triplane heading straight for you at Warp 9? How can your sensors suddenly report life forms on a dead planet? You're a long way from Starfleet Command and only you can discover what - or who - is challenging you beyond your wildest nightmares. Or can you?\n\n\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½Test your strategy as you play straight through the adventures, or lock phasers on target and clash with your enemy in head-on action.\n\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½As Captain Kirk, you and your entire crew - Spock, Dr. McCoy, Uhura, Sulu, Chekov and Scotty - bring the original, unique TV series humor on board.\n\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½Original series' voices, sound effects and music take you back to the action.\n\n\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€”ï¿½\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/star_trek_judgment_rites&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/star_trek_judgment_rites&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b073881113ff7958972733d925ddd4753d70425","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+Judgment+Rites+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b073881113ff7958972733d925ddd4753d70425","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,7,56,129,17,63,247,149,137,114,115,61,146,93,221,71,83,215,4,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
