It was a powerful demon indeed; a single swing of one of its nine tails would raise tsunamis and flatten mountains. It raised chaos and slaughtered many people, until the leader of the Leaf Village - the Fourth Hokage - defeated it by sacrificing his own life to seal the demon inside a newly-born child, whose origins are as yet unknown. That child's name was Naruto Uzumaki.\nAudi: Japanese\nSubtitles: English\n\nAll videos will play with standard video codecs and players.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01b655a8446664315368278fd3cbbce79a4164cb","amp;dn":"Naruto+Anime+-+All+Episodes+%26+Movies++-+English+Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01b655a8446664315368278fd3cbbce79a4164cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,182,85,168,68,102,100,49,83,104,39,143,211,203,188,231,154,65,100,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
