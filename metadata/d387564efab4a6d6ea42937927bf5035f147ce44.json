Diaz\nCRC Press | October 2014 | ISBN-10: 1466505400 | True PDF | 904 pages | 14.9 mb\n\nClinicians undergoing competency testing, certification, and periodic recertification are frequently faced with computer-based exams designed to evaluate clinical acumen and judgment. Test questions often include an image or radiograph followed by a vignette of the clinical encounter and a series of questions. Designed to better prepare practitioners for image-intense, computer-based examinations in their respective fields, Atlas of Human Poisoning and Envenoming is a visual and written reminder of the ubiquitous sources of toxins and toxoids in the environment and the outcomes of accidental or intentional toxic exposures in humans.\n\nThe Second Edition has been restructured with bulleted text, tables, and figures resembling the vignettes that accompany national examinations. Combining the four specialties of toxicologyÃ¢â‚¬â€analytical, medical, environmental, and industrialÃ¢â‚¬â€into one comprehensive atlas, the book presents photographs and diagrams of toxic plants and animals, their mechanisms of poisoning or envenoming, and the human responses caused by toxic exposure.\n\nHighlights of the new edition include:\n- Prescription and illicit drug abuse epidemics\n- Environmental and occupational nephrotoxicology and neurotoxicology\n- Tick paralysis\n- Petrochemical toxicants\n- Biological, chemical, and radiological warfare agents\n- Workplace substance abuse screening and monitoring\n- Epidemiological design and statistical analysis of toxicological investigations\n\nThe book is conveniently divided into four sections covering general medical toxicology, environmental toxicology, industrial and occupational toxicology, and epidemiology and statistics for toxicology. Supplemented with a 16-page color insert, the second edition includes new images and tables. The atlas will be a useful study guide for a range of practitioners preparing for a lifetime of image-intense national examinations.\n\nAbout the Author\nDr. James H. Diaz is board certified in anesthesiology, critical care medicine, pain management, general preventive medicine and public health, occupational/environmental medicine, and medical toxicology. Dr. Diaz served as a written and oral board examiner for the American Board of Anesthesiology from 1986 to 1996 and currently serves on the core examination committee of the American Board of Preventive Medicine. His current academic and clinical research interests include occupational and environmental toxicology, environmental and tropical infectious diseases and injuries in international travelers, emerging environmentally associated diseases and poisonings, and the impact of climate change on natural disasters, along with their public health outcomes.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface . ix\nAcknowledgments . xi\nAuthor . xiii\nSection I General Medical Toxicology\nChapter 1 The Pharmacology of Human Poisoning and Envenoming 3\nChapter 2 General Poisoning Management . 21\nChapter 3 Diagnostic Work-Up of the Poisoned Patient 37\nChapter 4 Poison53\nChapter 5 Toxicity of Antiseptics and Drug Additives 81\nChapter 6 Poisonings with Over-the-Counter and Opioid Analgesics . 89\nChapter 7 Household Product Poisonings 105\nChapter 8 Drug and Illicit Substance Abuse 167\nChapter 9 Anticonvulsants and Sedative-Hypnotics 207\nChapter 10 Reproductive and Perinatal Toxicology and Teratogenesis . 217\nChapter 11 Hypoglycemic and Other Endocrine Agent Toxicity . 233\nChapter 12 Cardiovascular Drug Toxicity . 241\nChapter 13 Antibiotic Toxicity . 257\nChapter 14 Anticancer Drug Toxicity 269\nChapter 15 Environmental and Occupational Nephrotoxicology 281\nChapter 16 Neurotoxicology 309\nSection II Environmental Toxicology\nChapter 17 Food Poisoning 359\nChapter 18 Seafood Poisoning . 379\nChapter 19 Mushroom Poisonings . 395\nChapter 20 Herbal Poisonings 413\nChapter 21 Common Poisonous Household and Garden Plants 443\nChapter 22 Bites and Stings: Terrestrial Envenomings 477\nChapter 23 Common Arthropod Vectors of Infectious Diseases 525\nChapter 24 Tick Paralysis 557\nChapter 25 Bites and Stings: Marine Envenomings 569\nChapter 26 Voodoo, Hoodoo, and Cajun Traditions and Poisonings . 583\nSection III Industrial and Occupational Toxicology\nChapter 27 Volatile Organic Chemicals 613\nChapter 28 Petrochemical Toxicity 629\nChapter 29 Industrial Gas Exposures and Occupational Lung Diseases . 645\nChapter 30 Metal and Metalloid Poisonings 673\nChapter 31 Pesticide Poisonings: Insecticides, Rodenticides, and Herbicides . 707\nChapter 32 Radiation Toxicology . 727\nChapter 33 Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Weapons and Warfare 747\nChapter 34 Workplace Substance Abuse Monitoring 769\nChapter 35 Miscellaneous Toxicants . 813\nSection IV Epidemiology and Statistics for Toxicology\nChapter 36 Epidemiology and Statistics for Toxicology 843","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d387564efab4a6d6ea42937927bf5035f147ce44","amp;dn":"Atlas+of+Human+Poisoning+and+Envenoming+%282nd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d387564efab4a6d6ea42937927bf5035f147ce44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,135,86,78,250,180,166,214,234,66,147,121,39,191,80,53,241,71,206,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
