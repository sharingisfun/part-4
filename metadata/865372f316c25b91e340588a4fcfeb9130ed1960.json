Our team has worked hard over the last three months to put together the most refined and user-friendly Manjaro release to date. This release includes our flagship Xfce edition, feature-rich KDE edition, lightweight Openbox edition and our minimal 'Net' edition. Although the general layout of our supported environments has not changed dramatically, there have been look-and-feel improvements, including a modern graphical bootsplash, new default theme (Menda) and a new look for our welcome screen.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:865372f316c25b91e340588a4fcfeb9130ed1960","amp;dn":"Manjaro+0.8.10+Xfce+64-bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"865372f316c25b91e340588a4fcfeb9130ed1960","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,83,114,243,22,194,91,145,227,64,88,138,79,207,235,145,48,237,25,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
