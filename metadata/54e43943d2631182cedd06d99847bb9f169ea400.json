Outside of Limp Bizkit, few bands are as reviled amongst the dark corners of comment sections where trolls make their home.\n\nWhile the bandÃ¢â‚¬â€or at least some of the actions taken by their frontman Frankie PalmeriÃ¢â‚¬â€have certainly warranted the attention; Ã¢â‚¬Å“Eternal EnemiesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ again proves itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not just his ego and insensitive merch that have earned them such a distinction.\n\nMetal and the majority of its offshoots have long been a place where technical ability &amp; powerful expressionism reign. These are traits that Emmure continue to lack on this latest album; a collection of fifteen tracks where frontman Frankie Palmeri works out his Napoleon complex atop monotonous single fret deathcore riffing, and rehashed nu metal squelch.\n\nAt its core Ã¢â‚¬Å“Eternal EnemiesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ seems like a vehicle tailored for PalmeriÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs angst and revenge fantasies. From his face adorning the cover to his smothering vocal performance; his presence is inescapable. Little surprise then that he fills up the outing with a precincts worth of good cop (spoken word raps)/bad cop (screams/bellows) vocals. His warnings and woes are routinely rapped and raged with his army of detractors rarely leaving his crosshairs.\n\nIn all honesty, this chance to fire back should have been the perfect platform for Emmure. Instead it emerges as one of the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest letdowns. For all the resentment and anger Palmeri and the band air out, it always seems to distill down to the same two themes: A. Palmeri could care less about the insults and disrespect lobbed his way; B. that people should try and say those comments to his face.\n\nTake Ã¢â‚¬Å“Most HatedÃ¢â‚¬Å“, where Palmeri adopts his best Fred Durst impression, repeatedly telling those who wanted to see him fail to Ã¢â‚¬Å“eat dickÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Interestingly that song is perhaps the most ambitious cut on the effort; adapting a Deftones-styled vocal melody on the chorus and adding in some throbbing electronics. But with such a stilted lyrical repertoire itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crippled from the get goÃ¢â‚¬â€sans the aforementioned blatantly placed opportunity for an audience callback\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Hang UpÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ finds Palmeri taking other musicians to task, spouting Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m the realest motherfucker in the game, I see you faggots living perfect lives, selling all your bullshit angst. Sold my soul, so Satan explain, whereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s my money, power, fame?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (note a lyric sheet was not provided, so this may not be 100%.) ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s this innate need to incessantly call out others in painfully blunt English that takes away about the only chance this album had at succeeding.\n\nAt first you can understand where the band are coming from. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d actually be gratifying to see them cleverly use the backlash theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve endured to prove everyone wrong. But after a barrage of the same themes and song structures regurgitated with little variation, it all just feels like shallow attempts at shock value. The opening track originally being named Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bring A Gun To SchoolÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ just goes on to reaffirm the creative bankruptcy and level of desperation at play here.\n\nSadly the instrumental component is usually just as hollow as the vocals; forever trapped on the same 3 frets (four if you count open notes) and double kick rumble. Almost all of the above is punctuated by bass drops and nu metal squelch lifted directly from KornÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs library. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no shame in direct inspiration, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not exactly commendable when Ã¢â‚¬Å“Girls DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Like Boys, Girls Like 40Ã¢â‚¬Â²s And BluntsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is pretty much a reworked take on KornÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs Ã¢â‚¬Å“Good GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ until the chorus hits.\n\nFrom the sex scene groans in Ã¢â‚¬Å“HitomiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ShinobiÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬â€PalmeriÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs creeper ode to porn star Hitomi TanakaÃ¢â‚¬â€to the turntables and the cheesy crowd calls in Ã¢â‚¬Å“EÃ¢â‚¬Å“; thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just too much formulaic clichÃƒÂ© slopped on here to be taken seriously. The only break in character comes via the pop punk/screamo sounding Ã¢â‚¬Å“We Were Just KidsÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬â€a song that finds Palmeri attempting some actual emotional range. But after suffering through an albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth of banal, textbook deathcore riffs and stale nu metal leftovers, eternal damnation has already long set in.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54e43943d2631182cedd06d99847bb9f169ea400","amp;dn":"EMMURE-+Eternal+Enemies+%282014%29+320kps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54e43943d2631182cedd06d99847bb9f169ea400","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,228,57,67,210,99,17,130,206,221,6,217,152,71,187,159,22,158,164,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
