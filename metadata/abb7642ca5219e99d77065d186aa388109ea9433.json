The Melos Quartet was at its technical and expressive peak, obviously inspired by Mstislav Rostropovichâ€™s commanding yet truly collegial presence in the second cello chair. Vocal sensibility and contrapuntal awareness inform every phrase, to the point where even the Scherzoâ€™s slashing accents and the Finaleâ€™s rustic drive suggest healthy, well-trained lungs and larynxes rather than bow arms. Similarly, the conversational qualities that the musicians bring to the first movement circumvent the musicâ€™s longeurs (they observe the long exposition repeat). The broadly paced Adagio movement features accompanying sustained strings that provide a gentle, haunting backdrop to the celloâ€™s pizzicatos, while the playersâ€™ tempered approach to the central minor-key section contrasts to the pent-up fury you hear in the Auryn/PoltÃ©ra recording on Tacet and in Rostropovichâ€™s remake with the Emerson Quartet. DGâ€™s closely detailed yet warm analogue engineering sounds better than ever. A classic.&quot; --Jed Distler\r\n\r\nFRANZ SCHUBERT (1797-1828)\r\nString Quintet in C major, D 956\r\nMelos Quartett\r\nMstislav Rostropovich, cello II","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abb7642ca5219e99d77065d186aa388109ea9433","amp;dn":"Schubert%3A+String+Quintet+-+Melos+Qt%2C+Rostropovich+%281978%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abb7642ca5219e99d77065d186aa388109ea9433","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,183,100,44,165,33,158,153,215,112,101,209,134,170,56,129,9,234,148,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
