Composed between 1996 and 2002, these eight pieces are triadically based, shaded with modal inflections, and free of the tight dissonances and chromatic touches that adorned much of PÃƒÂ¤rt's music in the 1980s. &quot;Dopo la vittoria&quot; (1996), the &quot;Littlemore Tractus&quot; (2001), and &quot;Salve Regina&quot; (2002) all premiered here, are almost exclusively diatonic, and PÃƒÂ¤rt's bell-like voicings are quite effective in the resonant acoustics of Temple Church, London. Polyphony's pure tones and clear textures ring out with a glorious aural halo, and these recordings are hardly to be improved upon. Even though &quot;My heart's in the Highlands&quot; (2000) and the &quot;Nunc dimittis&quot; (2001) have also been recorded in fine performances on Black Box, the renditions by Polyphony predate them and are still the best. &quot;I am the true vine&quot; (1996), &quot;Triodion&quot; (1998), and &quot;Ã¢â‚¬Â¦which was the Son ofÃ¢â‚¬Â¦&quot; (2000) have been recorded before and released in surveys of varied consistency. However, their inclusion here with pieces of the same decade and style makes their place in his late oeuvre perfectly clear. Hyperion captures the hushed ambience of Polyphony's reverent performances.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. Dopo la vittoria, little cantata for chorus\n02.
