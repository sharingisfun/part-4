It was released in 1989 and became the group's largest seller, being certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 1990, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida ruled that the album was legally obscene; this ruling was later overturned by the Eleventh Circuit. It is the first album in history to be deemed legally obscene.\n\nIt would also be the final album to be released under the Skyywalker Records label. Following a successful lawsuit against Luther Campbell and Skyywalker Records by Star Wars creator and director George Lucas, the company was forced to change its name to Luke Records.\n\nOrigin\tMiami, Florida, U.S.\nGenres\tHip hop, Miami bass\nYears active\t1985Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1991, 1994Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1998 (Reunions: 2003, 2012, 2014)\nLabels\tFresh Beat / Macola Records,Luke Records,Lil Joe Records","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:847243d3437a4d94920d1a0b7f210c27b4c478e7","amp;dn":"2+Live+Crew-As+Nasty+As+They+Wanna+Be+1989+..320kbps+%28stPaddy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"847243d3437a4d94920d1a0b7f210c27b4c478e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,114,67,211,67,122,77,148,146,13,26,11,127,33,12,39,180,196,120,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
