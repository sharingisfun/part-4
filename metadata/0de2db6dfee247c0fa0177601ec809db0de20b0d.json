The institution had an enormous economic impact and was central to the wealth of the agrarian South. It had as great an impact on American culture, cementing racism and other attitudes that echo into the present. This encyclopedia is an ambitious examination of all the issues surrounding slavery: the origins, the justifications, the controversies, and the human drama.\n\nThese volumes represent the work of 75 distinguished scholars from around the world. Ten thematic essays present a thorough examination of slavery and slave culture, including a rare treatment of slavery from the slave's point of view. Three hundred AÃ¢â‚¬â€œZ entries provide instant access to specific people, issues, and events. Today, slavery's immorality seems obvious. This encyclopedia provides the student or general reader with an in-depth explanation of how the practice evolved and was normalized, then anathematized and abolished","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0de2db6dfee247c0fa0177601ec809db0de20b0d","amp;dn":"Slavery+in+the+United+States+%282+Volume+Set%29+%282007%29+Pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0de2db6dfee247c0fa0177601ec809db0de20b0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,226,219,109,254,226,71,192,250,1,119,96,30,200,9,219,13,226,11,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
