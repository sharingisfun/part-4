To give an accurate impression of what is in a designer's mind it is vital to have complete mastery of the rules of figure drawing. Here, realism and anatomical precision are the chief values, whereas for costume and fashion, stylization and exaggeration are ways of adding individuality and verve to a plate, and of focusing attention on specific elements. FIGURE DRAWING FOR FASHION DESIGN offers a concise, topic by topic guide to acquiring and perfecting these skills, concentrating on the female form. The coverage provided means that this book is ideal both for those who want to apply themselves professionally to fashion design, and for all enthusiasts of drawing the human body.\n\nBook Reviews\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Figure-Drawing-Fashion-Design-Pepin/dp/9054960809&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Figure-Drawing-Fashion-Design-Pepin/dp/9054960809&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAuthors\nElisabetta Drudi, Tiziana Paci","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b95c926167a0bb35c00eae376ed175fac490191","amp;dn":"Figure+Drawing+for+Fashion+Design%7Eariane_c","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b95c926167a0bb35c00eae376ed175fac490191","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,149,201,38,22,122,11,179,92,0,234,227,118,237,23,95,172,73,1,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
