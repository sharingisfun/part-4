But a skyscraper is more than just steel and glass, itâ€™s an intricate ecosystem, full of people that live and work in the building. They become a complex machine that needs your steady hand to keep it running smoothly and efficiently. \r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the moment you break ground, every decision rests with you. As the architect you must coordinate the construction of everything - every wall and wire, every office and apartment. As the building owner you must keep your tenants happy - and paying rent on time. As a savvy developer you must keep an eye on the bottom line and invest in the future. Succeed and you will reap the rewards of a prestigious address where everyone will clamor to live and work. Fail and you will watch tenants leave in disgust, taking their business elsewhere and leaving your reputation in tatters. \r\n\r\n\r\nWill you create an exclusive office highrise that attracts business leaders from around the world? Will you construct luxury apartments in the sky, penthouses for the elite and playgrounds for the famous?

Success is entirely in your hands.\r\nFeatures\r\nDeep and complex simulation of a modern skyscraper. \r\nHuge variety of tenants with their own unique characteristics, from restaurants, to offices, retail stores, or residential apartments. \r\nOpen sandbox play with several difficulty levels and starting conditions allowing you to build your dream skyscraper towering above the surrounding city. \r\nCampaign mode that tests your skill at building a successful highrise in challenging scenarios. \r\nTest your management mettle by keeping up with your buildings diverse population and their ever-increasing demands. \r\nHire specialized consultants to increase your building's curb appeal, operational efficiency, and pull with city hall.\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\nWindows Mac OS X\r\nMINIMUM: \r\nOS: Windows 7 or later \r\nProcessor: Core i5 \r\nMemory: 2 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: Integrated video (Intel HD 4000 or later), 1 GB shared memory \r\nStorage: 500 MB available space \r\nAdditional Notes: Display: 1280 x 720\r\nRECOMMENDED: \r\nOS: Windows 7 or later \r\nProcessor: Core i7 \r\nMemory: 4 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: Dedicated video, 1 GB VRAM \r\nStorage: 500 MB available space \r\nAdditional Notes: Display: 1920 x 1080\r\nKasedo Games is a division of Kalypso Media Group.
