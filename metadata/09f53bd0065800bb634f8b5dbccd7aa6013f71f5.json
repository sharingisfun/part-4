Though the least prominent member of the quartet, he distinguished himself as an occasional singer of good-natured material and as an actor. Upon the group's split, Starr went solo with two novelty projects: the first, an album called Sentimental Journey, found him covering pre-rock standards, and the second, Beaucoups of Blues, was a country music collection. Starr then scored Top Ten hits with two non-album singles, &quot;It Don't Come Easy&quot; in 1971 and &quot;Back Off Boogaloo&quot; in 1972. He paired with producer Richard Perry one year later and, with assistance from the three other ex-Beatles, made Ringo, which featured two number one hits, &quot;Photograph&quot; and &quot;You're Sixteen.&quot; &quot;Oh My My,&quot; a Top Ten hit, was also included, and those three singles helped push the album to platinum certification. Almost as successful was the 1974 follow-up, Goodnight Vienna, which featured the hits &quot;Only You&quot; and &quot;No No Song.&quot;\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tWeb\n\n01.Photograph\n02.It Don't Come Easy\n03.You're Sixteen (You're Beautiful And You're Mine)\n04.Back Off Boogaloo\n05.I'm The Greatest\n06.Oh My My\n07.Only You (And You Alone)\n08.Beaucoups Of Blues\n09.Early 1970\n10.Snookeroo\n11.The No-No Song\n12.(It's All Down To) Good Night Vienna\n13.Hey Baby\n14.A Dose Of Rock &amp;  Roll\n15.Weight Of The World\n16.King Of Broken Hearts\n17.Never Without You\n18.Act Naturally (Duet With Buck Owens)\n19.Wrack My Brain\n20.Fading In And Fading Out\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09f53bd0065800bb634f8b5dbccd7aa6013f71f5","amp;dn":"Ringo+Starr+-+The+Very+Best+Of+%282007%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09f53bd0065800bb634f8b5dbccd7aa6013f71f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,245,59,208,6,88,0,187,99,79,139,93,188,205,122,166,1,63,113,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
