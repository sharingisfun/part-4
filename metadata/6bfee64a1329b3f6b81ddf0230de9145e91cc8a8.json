Fortunately, &quot;Pure Heroine&quot; (note the silent E in both the title and its author's stage name) delivers on the promise of Lorde's Top 10 hit &quot;Royals,&quot; and then some.\n\nBuilt around producer Joel Little's deep bass rumbles, lilting loops and programmed beats, the album evokes the shadowy sonics of Massive Attack and the XX. In the center of the heaviness, however, is a 16-year-old with a dynamic voice and an even better pop sensibility: &quot;Ribs&quot; finds Lorde waxing poetic about the scariness of getting older, while new single &quot;Team&quot; fashions a commanding hook out of the singer's disillusionment with modern pop music.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/BNEkhYR.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/BNEkhYR.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bfee64a1329b3f6b81ddf0230de9145e91cc8a8","amp;dn":"Lorde+-+Pure+Heroine+%5B2013%5D+%5BFLAC%5D+%5BVINYL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bfee64a1329b3f6b81ddf0230de9145e91cc8a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,254,230,74,19,41,179,246,184,29,223,2,48,222,145,69,233,28,200,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
