She made simmering ballads, declarative message songs, and better-than-average up-tempo numbers, and at the time was among the top-selling female vocalists in any style. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Killing Me Softly With His Song\n02 - Jesse\n03 - No Tears (In the End)\n04 - I'm the Girl\n05 - River\n06 - Conversation Love\n07 - When You Smile\n08 - Suzanne\n\nEnjoy and share!
