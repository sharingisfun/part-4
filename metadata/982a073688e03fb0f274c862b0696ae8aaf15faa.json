Russell Johnston, Elliot Eisenberg,Phillip Cornwell and David Mazurek\nProduct Description\nContinuing in the spirit of its successful previous editions, the ninth edition of Beer, Johnston, Mazurek, and Cornwell's Vector Mechanics for Engineers provides conceptually accurate and thorough coverage together with a significant refreshment of the exercise sets and online delivery of homework problems to your students. Nearly forty percent of the problems in the text are changed from the previous edition.The Beer/Johnston textbooks introduced significant pedagogical innovations into engineering mechanics teaching. The consistent, accurate problem-solving methodology gives your students the best opportunity to learn statics and dynamics. At the same time, the careful presentation of content, unmatched levels of accuracy, and attention to detail have made these texts the standard for excellence.\nProduct Details\nHardcover: 1376 pages\nPublisher: McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math; 9 edition (January 26, 2009)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0077275551\nISBN-13: 978-0077275556","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:982a073688e03fb0f274c862b0696ae8aaf15faa","amp;dn":"Vector+Mechanics+for+Engineers%3A+Statics+and+Dynamics+9th+by+Beer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"982a073688e03fb0f274c862b0696ae8aaf15faa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,42,7,54,136,224,63,176,242,116,200,98,176,105,106,232,170,241,95,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
