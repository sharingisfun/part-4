But when he meets the hauntingly pale, steely-eyed Joshua York, he is certain. For York doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care that the icy winter of 1857 has wiped out all but one of MarshÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dilapidated fleet. Nor does he care that he wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t earn back his investment in a decade. York has his own reasons for wanting to traverse the powerful Mississippi. And they are to be none of MarshÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s concernÃ¢â‚¬â€no matter how bizarre, arbitrary, or capricious his actions may prove. \n\nMarsh meant to turn down YorkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s offer. It was too full of secrets that spelled danger. But the promise of both gold and a grand new boat that could make history crushed his resolveÃ¢â‚¬â€coupled with the terrible force of YorkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mesmerizing gaze. Not until the maiden voyage of his new sidewheeler Fevre Dream would Marsh realize he had joined a mission both more sinister, and perhaps more noble, than his most fantastic nightmare...and mankindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most impossible dream. \nHere is the spellbinding tale of a vampireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quest to unite his race with humanity, of a garrulous rivermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dream of immortality, and of the undying legends of the steamboat era and a majestic, ancient river","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:247be71f3e0186536e99ad7547bf3c13a2324e74","amp;dn":"Fevre+Dream+by+George+R.R.+Martin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"247be71f3e0186536e99ad7547bf3c13a2324e74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,123,231,31,62,1,134,83,110,153,173,117,71,191,60,19,162,50,78,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
