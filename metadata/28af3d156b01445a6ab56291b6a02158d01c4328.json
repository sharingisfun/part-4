The long-held picture of German women holding down the home front during the war, as loyal wives and cheerleaders for the FÃƒÂ¼hrer, pales in comparison to Lower's incisive case for the massive complicity, and worse, of the 500,000 young German women she places, for the first time, directly in the killing fields of the expanding Reich.\n\nHitler's Furies builds a fascinating and convincing picture of a morally &quot;lost generation&quot; of young women, born into a defeated, tumultuous post-World War I Germany, and then swept up in the nationalistic fervor of the Nazi movement-a twisted political awakening that turned to genocide. These young women-nurses, teachers, secretaries, wives, and mistresses-saw the emerging Nazi empire as a kind of &quot;wild east&quot; of career and matrimonial opportunity, and yet could not have imagined what they would witness and do there. Lower, drawing on twenty years of archival and field work on the Holocaust, access to post-Soviet documents, and interviews with German witnesses, presents overwhelming evidence that these women were more than &quot;desk murderers&quot; or comforters of murderous German men: that they went on &quot;shopping sprees&quot; for Jewish-owned goods and also brutalized Jews in the ghettos of Poland, Ukraine, and Belarus; that they were present at killing-field picnics, not only providing refreshment but also taking their turn at the mass shooting. And Lower uncovers the stories, perhaps most horrific, of SS wives with children of their own, whose female brutality is as chilling as any in history.\n\nHitler's Furies will challenge our deepest beliefs: genocide is women's business too, and the evidence can be hidden for seventy years.\n\nLength: 8 hrs and 31 mins \n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28af3d156b01445a6ab56291b6a02158d01c4328","amp;dn":"Hitler%27s+Furies++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28af3d156b01445a6ab56291b6a02158d01c4328","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,175,61,21,107,1,68,90,106,181,98,145,182,160,33,88,208,28,67,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
