Six young, well to do Jamaicans, they\nacquitted themselves well supporting Marley and The Wailers on their 76 UK Tour then released a first album that\nelicited sharply polarised reactions.\n\nSome took Third WorldÃ‚ï¿½ to task for its lack of roots, reggae,\nroughness and commitment, others (our own CSM among them) praised its eclecticism and knowing sophistication.\n\nThe bands approach was certainly lateral. The album featured little original material but instead balanced renditions\nof JA torch songs (by the Spear) against others of American soul classics. Third World themselves landed somewhere\nbetween these two tangents extremes that were, after all, more closely related in earlier days when\nJamaica musicians looked to the American mainland for a large part of their inspiration. Third World's\nhybrid was soft-focussed, making much (and good) use of studio and instrumental technology.\n\nFor their\ntroubles, Third World were awarded honours and accolades in Jamaica. 1977 has seen them touring the US, East and West\ncoast college circuit and thinking very hard about a second album. 96 DegreesÃ‚ï¿½ is the result of months spent recording,\nscrapping, mixing, remixingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nBunny Wailers tender DreamlandÃ‚ï¿½ is the only non-original here. The other\nseven songs are Ã¢â‚¬Å“ well, just check the titles: Jah GloryÃ‚ï¿½, Tribal WarÃ‚ï¿½, Human Market Place, Third World ManÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ï¿½, and\nso forth. At least the apparent stylistic conflict of the first album has been resolved.\nFrom here on in\nitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a matter of person preference. If you are already conversant with current JA sounds, then Third World aren\nlikely to impress. Bassist Richard Daley and drummer William Stewart cut neat but lightweight rhythms. The lead vocals\nby Bunny (not the ex-Wailer) are uncharismatic, by no means strong; the band lyrics are almost uncomfortably earnest,\nnever entirely convincing. As it is, most other JA singers succeed in lending their chosen articles of faith far greater\npoignancy. Third Worlds Jah GloryÃ‚ï¿½, for example, may be one of several undeniably pleasant melodies but it hardly\nthe ecstatic hymn of praise you might anticipate. Even the title song (also the single) fails to strike fire, despite\nits dealing with some callous execution ritual committed by the British Imperial Army last century. The power simple\nisn't there, boys.\n\nIf on the other hand you ÃƒÂ¢re wary of JA and can' t seem to find a suitable entry point\ninto a proud, self-supportive music (but want to), then Third World could conceivably provide that access. The band\ndescribe themselves as second generation JA musicians searching to expand the horizons of the inheritance. The songs are\nvery well arranged. Both sides open with Michael Cooper layered synthesisers evoking uncharted tropical latitudes of\nmysterious grandeur. Stephen Moore lead guitar is uniformly excellent, whether electric (with devices) or acoustic\n(without); he admired Hendrix and it shows.\nThe African, American and all compass points influences on Third World\nare obvious, but they assimilate them carefully. Weak though the rhythms may be on the JA scale, they are firm\nenough.\nMyself I don't care that much for 96 DegreesÃ‚ï¿½ though the group are thoughtful, sincere, individuals and\ntheir work deserves to be heard, postulating as it does one of many possible ways in which JA music might take some\nGreat Leap Outward from its embattled citadel. Whether or not that Leap is desirable (or even necessary) is something\nelseÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05d437478968bac26ec0483fd370a9dc65311b8e","amp;dn":"Third+World+-+96+In+The+Shade%5BFlac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05d437478968bac26ec0483fd370a9dc65311b8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,212,55,71,137,104,186,194,110,192,72,63,211,112,169,220,101,49,27,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
