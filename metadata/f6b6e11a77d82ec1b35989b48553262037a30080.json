They each adopted the surname &quot;Ramone&quot; even though they weren't brothers. They pioneered a new basic punk rock sound, they got rid of the long guitar solos. Thier songs were fast (most were about 2 minutes long) , raw and similar to the 1950s/1960s rock and roll sound before them. They belonged the New York Punk scene in the 70s that included the New York Dolls as well as inspiring future members of the Clash and the Sex Pistols.\n\nFor a band that has created brilliant songs since the 70s and influenced some of todays bands like Green Day and the Red Hot Chilli Peppers, although thier sounds are very different.They even starred in a film called &quot;Rock and Roll High School&quot;. Their influence even extends to the science world where species of tiliobites bear the names: Mackenziurus johnnyi, Mackenziurus joeyi, Mackenziurus deedeei, and Mackenziurus ceejayi. \n\nThis CD contains 18 of the best Ramones tracks (Surfin' Bird, Blitzkrieg Bop) but in my opinion, that is not enough, tracks such as &quot;The KKK took my baby away&quot; are missing. However, this CD would be ideal for people who are looking for an introduction into the New York Punk scene as it summarises the Ramones well but for fans like me, more would be needed for me to buy it. The lyrics aren't thought provoking but then again the Ramones were more known for their sound rather than thier lyrics. \n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Pet Semetary\n[02] Don't Bust My Chops\t\n[03] Ignorance Is Bliss\n[04] 'Poison Heart\n[05] Anxiety \n[06] Take It As It Comes\t\t\n[07] Out of Time\t\n[08] Somebody to Love \n[09] I Don't Wanna Grow Up \n[10] Got A Lot To Say\n[11] Sheena Is a Punk Rocker (Live) \n[12] Surfin' Bird (Live) \n[13] Cretin Hop (Live)\n[14] Rockaway Beach (Live)\n[15] I Wanna Be Sedated (Live) \n[16] Rock And Roll Radio (Live)\n[17] Blitzkrieg Bop (Live) \n[18] Teenage Lobotomy (Live) \n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:42m:19s\n\nTotal Folder File Size\t- 102mb (Including mp3, Art Covers &amp; Booklet, word doc)\n\nTotal Mp3 Bit Rate \t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes 7.6.1.9  Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Punk Rock\n\nOriginal CD Ripper \t- only1joe\n\nOriginal CD Uploader\t- only1joe\n\nOriginally Released\t- 2003\n\nRecords Company    \t- Disky EMI Records\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.officialramones.com \n\n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\nAny Errors In Torrents Or Music Files ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Leave A Comment On My Most Recent Torrent.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6b6e11a77d82ec1b35989b48553262037a30080","amp;dn":"%5B2003%5D+The+Best+Of+-+The+Ramones+-+102mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6b6e11a77d82ec1b35989b48553262037a30080","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,182,225,26,119,216,46,193,179,89,137,180,133,83,38,32,55,163,0,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
