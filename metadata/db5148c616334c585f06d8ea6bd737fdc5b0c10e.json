Aside from having to use the fixes included, works perfectly for me. Below is the original description.\n\n-\n\nHere is the complete GTA Trilogy Native for Mac OSX ready to be played!\n\nFIXED IN THIS RELEASE:\n1. Intel GMA Support On GTA III, GTA Vice City, And GTA San Andreas.\n2. More Lion Capability And Smoothness.\n3. Fixed Some Bugs In GTA Vice City (Like Compatibility With PC Saves old saves not compatible)\n4. Fixed Sound Bug In GTA 3 And Vice City.\n5. Fixed Ringy Audio Problem In GTA III\n6. Fixed all three games so they do not ask you for updates.\n7. Fixed a mouse bug in san andreas and vice city.\n8. Fixed crashing on vice city with film studio missions and the downtown ammunation.\n\nContents:\n- GTA 3 Native K'ed\n- GTA Vice City Native K'ed\n- GTA San Andreas Native K'ed\n\nThey are ready to be played :)\n\nNOTE: There is an ugly setting in the options menu from the game called &quot;Framelimiter&quot;, this was turned on in the beginning and the game played awfully slow. Turning it off made the game perform excellent on all the highest settings.\n\nIf you used an older version please run the crack removal process located in Extra/OLD CRACK REMOVAL.\n\nIf GTA III or GTA Vice City give a resolution error, install the patches in the 640X480 folder.\n\nCracked by Gamecracker401 and packed by MKSoftware","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db5148c616334c585f06d8ea6bd737fdc5b0c10e","amp;dn":"GTA+Trilogy+Mac+Native+K%27ed+V2.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db5148c616334c585f06d8ea6bd737fdc5b0c10e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,81,72,198,22,51,76,88,95,6,216,234,107,215,55,253,197,176,193,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
