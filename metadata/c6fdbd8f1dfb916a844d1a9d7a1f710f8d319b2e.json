He has worked with lyricist Bernie Taupin as his songwriter partner since 1967; they have collaborated on more than 30 albums to date.\nJohn received a knighthood from HM Queen Elizabeth II for &quot;services to music and charitable services&quot; and became Sir Elton Hercules John, CBE in 1998.\nIn his four-decade career John has sold more than 250 million records, making him one of the most successful artists of all time. His single &quot;Candle in the Wind 1997&quot; has sold over 33 million copies worldwide, and is the best selling single in Billboard history. He has more than 50 Top 40 hits, including seven consecutive No. 1 US albums, 56 Top 40 singles, 16 Top 10, four No. 2 hits, and nine No. 1 hits. He has won six Grammy Awards, an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award and a Tony Award. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him Number 49 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time.\nJohn was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. He has been heavily involved in the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s, and was knighted in 1998. In 1992 he established the Elton John AIDS Foundation and a year later began hosting the annual Academy Award Party, which has since become one of the most high-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry. Since its inception, the foundation has raised over $200 million. John entered into a civil partnership with David Furnish on 21 December 2005 and continues to be a champion for LGBT social movements. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked him as the most successful male solo artist on &quot;The Billboard Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists&quot; (third overall, behind only The Beatles and Madonna).\n\n.: Elton John :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img215.imageshack.us/img215/4199/eltonjohnhi2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img215.imageshack.us/img215/4199/eltonjohnhi2.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\nStudio albums\n1969 Empty Sky (Japan Remastered) @320\n1970 Chartbusters Go Pop (1969-1970) @320\n1970 Elton John (Deluxe Edition, 2 CD) @320\n1970 Tumbleweed Connection (Deluxe Edition, 2 CD) @320\n1971 Madman Across The Water (Japan Remastered) @320\n1972 Honky Chateau @320\n1973 Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player @320\n1973 Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (2 CD) @320\n1974 Caribou @320\n1975 Captain Fantastic And The Brown Dirt Cowboy @320\n1975 Rock Of The Westies @320\n1976 Blue Moves (2 CD) @320\n1978 A Single Man (1998 Edition) @320\n1979 The Complete Thom Bell Sessions @320\n1979 Victim Of Love @320\n1980 21 at 33 @320\n1981 The Fox @320\n1982 Jump Up! @320\n1983 Too Low For Zero (1998 Remaster) @320\n1984 Breaking Hearts @320\n1985 Ice On Fire (1998 Remaster) @320\n1986 Leather Jackets @320\n1988 Reg Strikes Back @320\n1989 Sleeping With The Past @320\n1991 Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me (Single George Michael) @320\n1992 The One @320\n1993 Duets @320\n1995 Made in England @320\n1997 Candle In The Wind (Single) @320\n1997 The Big Picture @320\n1999 Aida @320\n2001 Songs From The West Coast @320\n2004 Peachtree Road (Special Collector's CD Edition) @320\n2005 Billy Elliot (The Musical Elton John s Party) @320\n2006 The Captain And The Kid @320\n2008 Legendary Covers As Sung by Elton John (Collection Rare Tracks) @320\n\nLive albums\n1971 17-11-70 @320\n1971 Madman Shakes Tokyo!
