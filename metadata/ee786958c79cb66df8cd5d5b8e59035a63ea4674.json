They're going to\nmake sure you know it, too. Despite the four-year absence from the studio between\nGreat Southern Trendkill and Reinventing the Steel, Pantera's unflagging aggression is confirmed by the full-throttle rhythms, throat-ripping vocals, and crunchy guitars. Call it their Metallica legacy, except that Pantera are more Metallica than Metallica these days. Heavy metal of this breed may be past its heyday, but Pantera's not going away quietly. In fact, evidence suggests that they're not going away at all--no matter how low you keep the volume knob, Reinventing the Steel is loud, loud, loud!\n--Genevieve Williams\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Hellbound                                            [02:41]\n02.Goddamn electric                                     [04:57]\n03.Yesterday don't mean shit                            [04:20]\n04.You've got to belong to it                           [04:13]\n05.Revolution is my name                                [05:16]\n06.Death rattle                                         [03:17]\n07.We'll grind that axe for A long time                 [03:45]\n08.Uplift                                               [03:46]\n09.It makes them disappear                              [06:23]\n10.IÃ¢â€Â¤ll cast A shadow                                   [05:25]\n________\n44:03 min\n 77,9 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
