Every song was recorded with the state-of-the-art Le Mobile remote recording truck and recently mastered to HDCD specifications, so needless to say, it sounds like youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re there, in the best seats in the house.\n\nThe Hampton Ã¢â‚¬Å“WarlocksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ box collects every note of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two Ã¢â‚¬Å“stealthÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ shows spread over six CDs. This collectorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s set comes packaged in a wooden replica of a cigar box (Virginia being a tobacco state dating back to colonial times), and is filled with all sorts of goodies, from a photo-laden historical essay to various pieces of cool memorabilia from the time.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d834a7265ba35af9345ea112143707250ba63232","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+Formerly+The+Warlocks+1989+%5B6CD+Box+Set%5D+%282010%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d834a7265ba35af9345ea112143707250ba63232","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,52,167,38,91,163,90,249,52,94,161,18,20,55,7,37,11,166,50,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
