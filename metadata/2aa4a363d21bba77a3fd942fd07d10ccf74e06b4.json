This time around the beats seem darker and more synth-oriented, giving it an edge reminiscent of the bass-heavy G-funk sound. &quot;As I Come Back&quot; is a good example, featuring a sustained keyboard note droning on throughout the chorus with Busta rapping in his raspy style. On the other hand, Rhymes can still make a good dance song, like the hypnotic &quot;What It Is,&quot; a fractured funk anthem that features robotic female vocals from Kelis and a slow beat consisting of clicks and snaps. Other guest appearances include P. Diddy's turn on the dramatic &quot;Pass the Courvoisier,&quot; Mary J. Blidge on &quot;There's Only One,&quot; and the occasional appearances by the Flipmode Squad, as well as production work from Pete Rock and Dr. Dre, among others. The only questionable track is a remake of Public Enemy's classic &quot;Shut 'Em Down&quot; that may leave some fans cold due to its different feel and message. But outside of the one track, this is another solid release from a consistent hip hop artist who can still make relevant, interesting albums long after his days with the Leaders of the New School. \n \n \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Intro [02:48] \n 02.Everybody rise again [04:14] \n 03.As I come back [03:20] \n 04.Shut 'em down 2002 [02:56] \n 05.Genesis [03:57] \n 06.Betta stay up in your [03:18] \n house (feat. rah digga) \n 07.We got what you want [03:52] \n 08.Truck volume [03:35] \n 09.Pass the courviosier [04:36] \n (feat.
