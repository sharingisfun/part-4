Split Second (2003)\nMichelle Maxwell has just blown her future with the Secret Service. Against her instincts, she led a presidential candidate out of her sight to comfort a grieving widow. Then, behind closed doors, the politician whose safety was her responsibility vanished into thin air. Living a new life on a quiet lake in central Virginia, Sean King knows how the younger agent feels. He's been there before. In an out-of-the-way hotel eight years earlier, the hard-charging Secret Service man allowed his attention to be diverted for a split second. And the presidential candidate Sean was protecting was gunned down before his eyes. Now Michelle and Sean are about to see their destinies converge. She has become obsessed with Sean's case. And he needs a friendÃ¢â‚¬â€especially since a series of macabre killings has brought him under suspicion and prompted the reappearance of a seductive woman he's tried hard to forget. As the two discredited agents enter a maze of lies, secrets, and deadly coincidences, they uncover a violence that shattered their lives were really a long time in the making - and are a long way from over.\n\n2. Hour Game (2004)\nKing and Maxwell return in Hour Game as private investigators hired to solve a domestic burglary and prove a man's innocence. They get drawn into a more sinister crime, a murder that appears to bear the hallmark of some of the most infamous killers of all time, and discover a macabre puzzle that offers one horrible revelation after another. Stunning secrets lead the partners into the middle of a frantic search for a killer unlike any they've confronted before.\n\n3. Simple Genius (2007)\nKing and Maxwell return as private investigators, their lives splintered around them and needing one another more than ever. Michelle encounters and struggles to defeat long-buried personal demons, while Sean, out of money from saving Michelle a costly personal lawsuit, is forced to investigate a murder just inside the CIA's fence near Williamsburg, Virginia, that reveals layer after layer of disinformation. Amid more murder, a seemingly autistic girlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extraordinary genius, and a powerful breakthrough in the realm of classified codes, Sean soon learns enough to put his life at risk. Sean and Michelle work together to catch a killer, save an innocent life and solve a stunning mystery that threatens the very soul of the nation.\n\n4. First Family (2009)\nIt began with what seemed like an ordinary children's birthday party. Friends and family gathered to celebrate. There were balloons and cake, games and gifts.\nThis party, however, was far from ordinary. It was held at Camp David, the presidential retreat. And it ended with a daring kidnapping . . . which immediately turned into a national security nightmare. Sean King and Michelle Maxwell were not looking to become involved. As former Secret Service agents turned private investigators, they had no reason to be. The FBI doesn't want them interfering. But years ago, Sean King saved the First Lady's husband, then a senator, from political disaster. Now, Sean is the one person the First Lady trusts, and she presses Sean and Michelle into the desperate search to rescue the abducted child. With Michelle still battling her own demons, and forces aligned on all sides against her and Sean, the two are pushed to the absolute limit. In the race to save an innocent victim, the line between friend and foe will become impossible to define . . . or defend.\n\n5. The Sixth Man (2011)\nEdgar Roy--an alleged serial killer held in a secure, fortress-like Federal Supermax facility-is awaiting trial. He faces almost certain conviction. Sean King and Michelle Maxwell are called in by Roy's attorney, Sean's old friend and mentor Ted Bergin, to help work the case. But their investigation is derailed before it begins--en route to their first meeting with Bergin, Sean and Michelle find him murdered. It is now up to them to ask the questions no one seems to want answered: Is Roy a killer? Who murdered Bergin? With help from some surprising allies, they continue to pursue the case. But the more they dig into Roy's past, the more they encounter obstacles, half-truths, dead-ends, false friends, and escalating threats from every direction. Their persistence puts them on a collision course with the highest levels of the government and the darkest corners of power. In a terrifying confrontation that will push Sean and Michelle to their limits, the duo may be permanently parted.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67e1447753a955b87f63c8ebf0b6eccae5d651d1","amp;dn":"King+and+Maxwell+Series+by+David+Baldacci+%28Books+1-5%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67e1447753a955b87f63c8ebf0b6eccae5d651d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,225,68,119,83,169,85,184,127,99,200,235,240,182,236,202,229,214,81,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
