These albums sported cover art handcrafted by band members, and the records have become rare collector's items. Whatever the title, Jerry Gordon, the person responsible for Evidence Music's ambitious reissues of the Saturn recordings, has constructed an excellent introduction to Sun Ra's cosmic empire of big-band swing, free-jazz improvisation, electronic sound effects, science fiction, and ancient Egyptian mysteries with this Greatest Hits.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88286483348c2d570f21e295521574e8509d5c9d","amp;dn":"Sun+Ra+-+Greatest+Hits+-+Easy+Listening+for+Intergalactic+Travel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88286483348c2d570f21e295521574e8509d5c9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,40,100,131,52,140,45,87,15,33,226,149,82,21,116,232,80,157,92,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
