(On ofcourse you location and broadband speed. =] )\n\nEnjoy.. \n\n\n\nAll Episodes!\n\nTaking a Borat approach to High School here is a tongue-in-cheek series brilliantly directed and performed by Chris Lilley. In a hilarious no-holds barred representation of 'school these days ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ with boys and perves and sex and drugs (where) it's not like it used to be ...' Lilley's theatrical vividness comes to life. Three characters equivalently blunt in their opinions co-exist at Summer Heights High School. The three main characters all acted by Lilley; Mr G ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the eccentric, 'camp' drama teacher, Jonah Takalua the Polynesian school scapegoat and smart-arse and Ja'mie the pretentious and elitist Hilford Girls exchange student all guarantee a laugh in the series. This is a satirical look at public schools, 'the worst place in Australia, where you can go get anorexia.' Playing on various truths and myths about public education, the school has all the necessary ingredients to prove microcosmic of schools today. There is Mr G's drama production, where a school play is written, directed and performed about the dangers of public education, discrimination towards Jonah and attitude to counter attacks made on him. There is also discrimination in Mr G's casting of his play towards disabled and less talented children , and bitchiness within Ja'mie's friendship group of 'public school skanks,' as well as the typical unruly classroom environment created by the class clown - Jonah. The show offers a students view of school as we know it. Though satirical, it makes a serious point about the need for change in public schools and public perception of public schools as seen through Ja'mie's character. Mr G in his musical production composes the song 'School these days ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“(stating) you'd have to be a fool these days, to wanna go to school these days.' Just one of the many musical scores bound to sound in your head for days and even months after viewing the series. This is a show that resonates with its audience while having us in stitches. With the suggestion of it being integrated into schools' syllabus, it may also stitch up school wrongs in time to save nine before a 'puck you with a P' revolution. For those who can't handle the candor of the series, in the words of Ja'mie, need to 'learn what a sense of humour is and just build a bridge and get over it.' This is a must see for adults and children alike. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dfbc7a7344c150b2a1c48823d40516f9b90903e","amp;dn":"Summer+Heights+High+Season+1+2007+All+Eps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dfbc7a7344c150b2a1c48823d40516f9b90903e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,251,199,167,52,76,21,11,42,28,72,130,61,64,81,111,155,144,144,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
