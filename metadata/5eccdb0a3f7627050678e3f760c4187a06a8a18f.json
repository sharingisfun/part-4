Then again, Supertramp's earlier records weren't as pop-oriented as Breakfast. \r\n\r\nThe majority of the album consisted of tightly written, catchy, well-constructed pop songs, like the hits &quot;The Logical Song,&quot; &quot;Take the Long Way Home,&quot; and &quot;Goodbye Stranger.&quot; Supertramp still had a tendency to indulge themselves occasionally, but Breakfast in America had very few weak moments. It was clearly their high-water mark.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01.
