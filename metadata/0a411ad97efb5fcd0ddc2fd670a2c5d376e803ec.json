While this results in the ability to cover a very broad field of knowledge, it also lacks some depth which could aid understanding.\nTherefore, it would be best for the user to be simultaneously or having already taken several classes as background. A basic knowledge of chemistry and statistics would be very helpful in understanding the material. Should the student be proficient in these subjects, the material referenced and briefly covered by the book will pose no difficulty.\nThe material presented is broad and should provide sufficient introduction to the extremely broad field of material science. With a background in introductory engineering classes, the text will present the usefulness of several calculations (stress, strain, etc) in a new light.\nThus, this book is adequate as an introduction to the wide range of concepts covered by the study of material science.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a411ad97efb5fcd0ddc2fd670a2c5d376e803ec","amp;dn":"The+Science+and+Engineering+of+Materials+%286th+Edition%29+by+Donald","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a411ad97efb5fcd0ddc2fd670a2c5d376e803ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,65,26,217,126,251,95,205,13,220,47,214,112,162,197,211,118,232,3,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
