As solid and engaging as anything she has written since her early vampire chronicle fictionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Alan Cheuse, The Boston Globe; Ã¢â‚¬Å“A delectable cocktail of old-fashioned lost-race adventure, shape-shifting and suspenseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Elizabeth Hand, The Washington Post), readers were spellbound as Rice imagined a daring new world set against the wild and beckoning California coast.\n\nNow in her new novel, as lush and romantic in detail and atmosphere as it is sleek and steely in storytelling, Anne Rice brings us once again to the rugged coastline of Northern California, to the grand mansion at Nideck PointÃ¢â‚¬â€to further explore the unearthly education of her transformed Man Wolf.\n\nThe novel opens on a cold, gray landscape. It is the beginning of December. Oak fires are burning in the stately flickering hearths of Nideck Point. It is Yuletide.

As Reuben finds himself caught up with the passions and yearnings of this spectral presence and the preparations for the Nideck town Christmas reach a fever pitch, astonishing secrets are revealed, secrets that tell of a strange netherworld, of spiritsÃ¢â‚¬â€centuries oldÃ¢â‚¬â€who possess their own fantastical ancient histories and taunt with their dark, magical powers .
