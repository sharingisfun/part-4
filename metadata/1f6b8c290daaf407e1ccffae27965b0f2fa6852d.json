But the Beasties weren't pirating -- instead, they treated rap as part of a post-punk musical underground, where the D.I.Y. aesthetics of hip-hop and punk weren't that far apart. Of course, the exaggerated b-boy and frat-boy parodies of their unexpected hit debut album, Licensed to Ill, didn't help their cause. For much of the mid-'80s, the Beastie Boys were considered macho clowns, and while they dismissed that theory with the ambitious, Dust Brothers-produced second album, Paul's Boutique, it was ignored by both the public and the press at the time. In retrospect, Paul's Boutique was one of the first albums to predict the genre-bending, self-referential pop kaleidoscope of '90s pop. The Beasties refined their eclectic approach with 1992's Check Your Head, where they played their own instruments. Check Your Head brought the Beasties back to the top of the charts, and within a few years, they were considered one of the most influential and ambitious groups of the '90s, cultivating a musical community not only through their music, but with their record label, Grand Royal, and their magazine of the same name.\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nGenre:                  Instrumental\n\n\n\nAudio-Info\n\n\n\n01.B For My Name\n02.14th St. Break\n03.Suco De Tangerina\n04.The Gala Event\n05.Electric Worm\n06.Freaky Hijiki\n07.Off The Grid\n08.The Rat Cage\n09.The Melee\n10.Dramastically Different\n11.The Cousin Of Death\n12.The Kangaroo Rat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                 ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                     ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f6b8c290daaf407e1ccffae27965b0f2fa6852d","amp;dn":"Beastie+Boys+-+The+Mix-Up+2007+++++CBR320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f6b8c290daaf407e1ccffae27965b0f2fa6852d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,107,140,41,13,170,244,7,225,204,255,174,39,150,91,15,47,166,133,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
