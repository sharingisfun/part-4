Three years later, after a protracted divorce, she embarked on a yearlong trip of recovery, with three main stops: Rome, for pleasure (mostly gustatory, with a special emphasis on gelato); an ashram outside of Mumbai, for spiritual searching; and Bali, for &quot;balancing.&quot; These destinations are all on the beaten track, but Gilbert's exuberance and her self-deprecating humor enliven the proceedings: recalling the first time she attempted to speak directly to God, she says, &quot;It was all I could do to stop myself from saying, 'I've always been a big fan of your work.'&quot;\r\n\r\n160Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa2c39093d8a8f55e0e5558dde1820f3fdb11363","amp;dn":"Eat%2C+Pray%2C+Love+audiobook+by+Elizabeth+Gilbert+EarReaders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa2c39093d8a8f55e0e5558dde1820f3fdb11363","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,44,57,9,61,138,143,85,224,229,85,141,222,24,32,243,253,177,19,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
