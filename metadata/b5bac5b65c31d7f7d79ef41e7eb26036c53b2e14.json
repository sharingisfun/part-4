Sick of being the only virgin among her friends, she decides the best way to deal with the problem is to lose it as quickly and simply as possible-- a one-night stand. But her plan turns out to be anything but simple when she freaks out and leaves a gorgeous guy alone and naked in her bed with an excuse that no one with half-a-brain would ever believe. And as if if that weren't embarrassing enough, when she arrives for her first class of her last college semester, she recognizes her new theatre professor. She'd left him naked in her bed about 8 hours earlier.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5bac5b65c31d7f7d79ef41e7eb26036c53b2e14","amp;dn":"LOSING+IT+-+Cora+Carmack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5bac5b65c31d7f7d79ef41e7eb26036c53b2e14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,186,197,182,92,49,215,247,215,158,244,30,126,178,96,54,197,59,46,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
