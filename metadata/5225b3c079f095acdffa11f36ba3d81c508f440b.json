So why can we not solve them? According to Edward de Bono, current thinking cannot solve world problems because current thinking is itself the problem. And this is getting worse: we are so accustomed to readily available information online that we search immediately for the answers rather than thinking about them. Our minds function like trying to drive a car using only one wheel. There's nothing wrong with that one wheelÃ¢â‚¬â€conventional thinkingÃ¢â‚¬â€but we could all get a lot further if we used all four. De Bono examines why we think the way we do from a historical perspective and uses some of his famous thinking techniques combined with new ideas to show us how to change the way we think. If we strengthen our ability and raise our thinking level, other areas of our lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€both personal and business successÃ¢â‚¬â€will improve. De Bono is the master of the original big &quot;concept&quot; book and his enticement to us to use our minds as constructively as possible should appeal to a whole new generation of fans.\n\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                          Published - April 1st 2010\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5225b3c079f095acdffa11f36ba3d81c508f440b","amp;dn":"Think+Before+It%27s+Too+Late+by+Edward+De+Bono+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5225b3c079f095acdffa11f36ba3d81c508f440b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,37,179,192,121,240,149,172,223,250,17,243,107,163,216,28,80,143,68,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
