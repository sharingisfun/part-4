Without you this torrent will surely die.\n\n- Big Papi\n\n\n\nBy K. Haynes\n\nThis CD absolutely needs to be re-released. It is the best CD that Special Efx put out. Many albums have 3-4 great songs at the beginning of the CD and then peter out after that -- not this CD.\n\nDouble Feature starts with a smooth opener &quot;The Lady and The Sea,&quot; then picks up the intensity some with the intricate &quot;Jamaica, Jamaica&quot; (with lots of wooden blocks from George Jinda), and continues with some songs featuring vocals (smooth scat singing) from Bemshi and others.\n\nMy favorite song is the smokey, hazy &quot;Mirrors&quot; with some of Chieli's best, intricate guitar playing. &quot;Search For a Rainbow&quot; could have come from the previous &quot;Mystique&quot; CD, a slow-building burner from Jinda, with Cheili's e-bow echo guitar floating above.\n\nDouble Feature then saves two of it's strongest cuts for the last part of the CD. &quot;Thy Kingdom Come&quot; and &quot;Northern Lights&quot; are both high intensity guitar-fests, with layers of acoustic, classical and electric guitars. Cheili does not cut either song short, but lets them both build and progress, taking the listener higher and higher before slowly returning them softly to earth.\n\nOnly &quot;Oasis,&quot; the last cut, is an optional listen, with some quirky, statcatto guitar and percussion that doesn't quite seem to finish the CD smoothly. But it doesn't detract from the sheer brilliance and musicianship of the rest of this great CD.\n\nIt is absolutely Special Efx's best!\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nSpecial EFX - Double Feature\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Special EFX\nAlbum................: Double Feature\nGenre................: Jazz\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1988\n\nFLAC\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 55 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 264kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
