The characters are computer-modelled in 3D and set against natural scenery. Each animation has a self-contained and usually humorous storyline. The audio is a combination of genuine insect and ambient recordings with artificial sound effects. The various protagonist insects often perform anthropomorphic activities, displaying ironically portrayed intelligence, enjoyment and, sometimes, pathos. The background settings are generally of rural France, and include farm houses, fences, cars, road surfaces, drains, gutters and garbage bins. In Season 1 episodes, humans appeared only peripherally (e.g., as mute drivers of intrusive vehicles) and large farm animals were the main reluctant witnesses to the variety of insect, spider and mollusc activities. Some Season 2 episodes depict more explicit interaction with humans.\n\nEpisodes tend to follow one or more insect characters through a specific situation and have involved storylines such as multi-insect races reminiscent of the pod race sequence in Star Wars:The Phantom Menace, a spider becoming trapped on a helium balloon, and a grasshopper maliciously launching other unsuspecting insects from a catapult made from a blade of grass.\n\n\nList of Episodes:\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=747189#pid747189&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=747189#pid747189&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFormat :\t\tx264\nFile size:  \t\t70 MiB avg. per episode \nDuration : \t\t5 min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t\t720 pixels\nHeight : \t\t576 pixels\nAspect ratio :   \t4:3\nFrame rate :    \t25 fps\nAudio:  \t\tAAC\nNr. of Files:\t\t78 + 1 Trailer + 1 Teaser + 1 txt = 81\n\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original file names intact.\nThis pack wouldn't have been possible without you, we worship you,\n\n+++eztv+++TvTeam+++VTV+++scenebalance+++TorrentDay+++eztv+++\n                                      and the release groups\n2HD,ASAP,FQM,LOL,IMMERSE,FEVER,SYS,ORENJI,REWARD,SPASTiKUS,MiXED,MOMENTUM, and all the others (too many to mention them all)\n\nAfter 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.\n\n###################  You like your show in one pack?  ###################\n#########################  Here you go!  #########################\nVisit the KABLAM!!! @ forum.suprbay.org\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor questions,requests,comments feel free to PM me on SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWant to be kept in the loop?
