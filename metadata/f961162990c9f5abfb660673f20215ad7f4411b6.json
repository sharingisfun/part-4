The dead are returning to life and attacking the living. The people they kill get up and kill ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s spreading like wildfire. Curiously, there are a few people left in Britain who arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t worried about any of this ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s because theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re the remaining contestants in Big Brother. Cocooned in the safety of the Big Brother house, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re blissfully unaware of the horrific events unfolding outside. Until an eviction night when all hell breaks loose. \n\nKelly, (Jaime Winstone) the production runner working on Big Brother finds herself caught in the impossible position of trying to fend off the walking dead alongside the remaining housemates, Davina herself, a host of former Big Brother housemates, her producer boss Patrick (Andy Nyman) and boyfriend Riq (Riz Ahmed).\n\nOver the ensuing days, in a cruel reflection of the game show they thought they were entering, the contestants fall victim, one by one, to the hungry masses outside. Staying alive requires teamwork ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ which is tricky when youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re a group specifically selected by TV producers to wind each other up.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f961162990c9f5abfb660673f20215ad7f4411b6","amp;dn":"Dead+Set+all+Episodes+2008+720p+HDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f961162990c9f5abfb660673f20215ad7f4411b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,97,22,41,144,201,245,171,251,102,6,115,242,2,21,173,127,68,17,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
