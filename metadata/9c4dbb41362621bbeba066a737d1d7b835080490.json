Test your wits on nearly two hundred of the best puzzles ever, from a simple one found on an ancient Egyptian scroll, to the most complex cipher standing today in the CIA courtyard. Math puzzles, word puzzles, science oddities, cannibals and missionaries, true and false, deductive reasoning, probabilities, game theory problemsâ€”they are all here. Gathered from puzzle collections going back to the Romans, Noggintwisters gives you the problem, provides a hint, and then explains how the answer is arrived at. One puzzle was written by Nobel Laureate Richard Feynman when he was in high school, another comes from Abe Lincoln, a life long puzzle addict. And another comes from Albert Einstein, who thought only 2% of people could solve it. Galileo swings weights from the local cathedral, Newton tells you when to add cream to your coffee, Eratosthenes explains how to measure the circumference of the earth, and Rousseau presents the puzzle that is at the core of every political system. Great and small, serious and funny, these are mind games to sharpen your skills, flex your imagination and help you make it in the wild. Illustrated in full color with touch screen navigation, interactive table of contents and a linked index, Noggintwisters is built for tablets and smart phones as well.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author \nhttps://s32.postimg.org/yk2nlvfd1/Christopher_Burns.jpg\r\nChristopher Burns is editor of the Seashell Anthology of Great Poetry, (Random House, 1995), and author of the novel, Island Wilderness; Imagining the Early Years of Marthaâ€™s Vineyard which won honorable mention for fiction in the annual IPPY awards of 2005.
