Our Time Now\n  2.  Come Back To Me\n  3.  Hate (I Really Don&amp;#039;t Like You)\n  4.  You And Me\n  5.  Friends Don&amp;#039;t Let Friends Dial Drunk\n  6.  Making A Memory\n  7.  So Damn Clever\n  8.  Tearin&amp;#039; Us Apart\n  9.  Write You A Song\n  10. Gimmie A Chance\n  11. Figure It Out\n  12. Let Me Take You There\n  13. Hey There Delilah (Bonus Track)\n\nOn its third full-length, and first major-label release, the Chicago band evolved from being a punky good-time outfit with high-quality songs into a teen-friendly pop group with a rock edge. Highlights here include the self-explanatory &quot;Friends Don&amp;#039;t Let Friends Dial Drunk&quot; and &quot;Hate (I Really Don&amp;#039;t Like You),&quot; which both have a refreshing lyrical innocence that could both have been extracted from any talented 21st-century suburban post-teen, which is precisely where their charm lies.\n\nI ripped it from an actual CD, so quality is of the best.  Please seed for as long humanly possible, and all comments are appreciated.  Thank You.
