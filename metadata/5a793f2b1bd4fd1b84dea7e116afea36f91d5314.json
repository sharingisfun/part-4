After General MacArthur ignores Mao's warnings and pushes his UN forces deep into North Korea, his 10,000 First Division Marines find themselves surrounded and hopelessly outnumbered by 100,000 Chinese soldiers near the Chosin Reservoir. Their only chance for survival is to fight their way south through the Toktong Pass, a narrow gorge in the Nangnim Mountains. It will need to be held open at all costs.

The authors have conducted dozens of firsthand interviews with the battle's survivors, and they narrate the story with the imm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a793f2b1bd4fd1b84dea7e116afea36f91d5314","amp;dn":"The+Last+Stand+of+pany_+Korean+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a793f2b1bd4fd1b84dea7e116afea36f91d5314","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,121,63,43,27,212,253,27,132,222,167,225,22,175,234,54,249,29,83,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
