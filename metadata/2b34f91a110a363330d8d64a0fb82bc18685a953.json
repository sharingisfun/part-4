This is especially true at very low bit rates where the superior stereo coding, pure MDCT, and better transform window sizes leave MP3 unable to compete.\n\nWhile the MP3 format has near-universal hardware and software support, primarily due to MP3 being the format of choice during the crucial first few years of widespread music file-sharing/distribution over the internet, AAC is a strong contender due to some unwavering industry support\n\nAlbums:\n\n2008 - Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends (Japanese Retail) [FLAC]\n2005 - X&amp;Y (Japanese Special Edition) [FLAC]\n2002 - A Rush of Blood to the Head [FLAC]\n2000 - Parachutes (2CD Special Edition) [FLAC]\n\nEP's:\n\n2008 - Prospekt's March [FLAC]\n2005 - Sparks EP [FLAC]\n1999 - The Blue Room EP [FLAC]\n1999 - Brothers &amp; Sisters EP [FLAC]\n\nSingles:\n\n2008 - Viva La Vida (CDS) [FLAC]\n2008 - Violet Hill (CDS) [FLAC]\n2008 - Lost!
