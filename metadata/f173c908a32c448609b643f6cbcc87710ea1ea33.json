A rogues gallery of prostitutes, pimps, poisoners, pickpockets, murderers, and thieves, The Gangs of New York is a dramatic and entertaining glimpse at a city's dark past.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Gangs-New-York-Informal-Underworld/dp/0307388980/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373725687&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+gangs+of+new+york&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Gangs-New-York-Informal-Underworld/dp/0307388980/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373725687&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+gangs+of+new+york&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f173c908a32c448609b643f6cbcc87710ea1ea33","amp;dn":"The+Gangs+of+New+York%3A+An+Informal+History+of+the+Underworld+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f173c908a32c448609b643f6cbcc87710ea1ea33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,115,201,8,163,44,68,134,9,182,67,246,203,204,135,113,14,161,234,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
