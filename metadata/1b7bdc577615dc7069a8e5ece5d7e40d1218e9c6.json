But in fact, life gets better Ã¢â‚¬â€ and at an accelerating rate. Food availability, income, and life span are up; disease, child mortality, and violence are down all across the globe. Africa follows Asia out of poverty; the Internet, the mobile phone, and container shipping enrich people's lives as never before.\n\nIn his bold and bracing exploration into how human culture evolves positively through exchange and specialization, bestselling author Matt Ridley does more than describe how things are getting better. He explains why. An astute, refreshing, and revelatory work that covers the entire sweep of human history Ã¢â‚¬â€ from the Stone Age to the Internet Ã¢â‚¬â€ The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves will change your way of thinking about the world. For the better.\n\n&quot;An ambitious and sunny paean to human ingenuity, this is an argument for why ambitious optimism is morally mandatory.&quot; --Publishers Weekly\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction, General","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b7bdc577615dc7069a8e5ece5d7e40d1218e9c6","amp;dn":"The+Rational+Optimist_+How+Prosperity+Evolves.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b7bdc577615dc7069a8e5ece5d7e40d1218e9c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,123,220,87,118,21,220,112,105,168,229,236,229,215,228,13,18,24,233,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
