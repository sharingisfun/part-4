We all talk to ourselves all of the time, usually without realising it. And most of what we tell ourselves is negative, counterproductive and damaging, preventing us from enjoying a fulfilled and successful life. Shad Helmsetter's simple but profound techniques, based on an understanding of the processes of the human brain, have enabled thousands of people to get back in control of their lives. By learning how to talk to yourself in new ways, you will notice a dramatic improvement in all areas of your life. You will feel better and accomplish more. It will help you achieve more at work and at home, lose weight, overcome fears, stop smoking and become more confident. And it works. Shad Helmsetter, Ph.D, is a bestselling author of many personal growth books, and the leading authority in the field of Self-Talk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a62ec0d9756d8b090b24f334740c6c9d10085e03","amp;dn":"What+to+Say+When+you+Talk+To+Yourself+-+Shad+Helmstetter+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a62ec0d9756d8b090b24f334740c6c9d10085e03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,46,192,217,117,109,139,9,11,36,243,52,116,12,108,157,16,8,94,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
