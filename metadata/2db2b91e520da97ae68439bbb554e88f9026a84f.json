The central figure in the film is Irish-American Paul Brennan, a 56-year-old of great wit who traipses door to door in an effort to sell the good book to Catholic housewives who really can&amp;#039;t afford to buy but don&amp;#039;t want to appear rude to a Church-sanctioned representative. The documentary, a collaboration by the Maysles brothers, also follows Brennan as he shares war stories with fellow Bible peddlers and attends management and sales meetings. The Maysles&amp;#039; next film was their classic documentary of the Rolling Stones fateful 1969 tour, Gimme Shelter (1970).\nAMG\n\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
