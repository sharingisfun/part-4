The band has released seven full-length albums. Their most recent, There Is No Enemy, was released on October 6, 2009, and the band is currently touring the United States and Canada.\n\n\nFormer Treepeople guitarist/vocalist Doug Martsch formed Built to Spill in 1992 with Brett Netson and Ralf Youtz as the band's original members. In an interview with Spin magazine, Martsch stated that he intended to change the band's lineup for every album, himself being the only permanent member. After the band's first album, Ultimate Alternative Wavers was released in 1993, Netson and Youtz were replaced by Brett Nelson (not Netson) and Andy Capps for 1994's There's Nothing Wrong with Love. A compilation album called The Normal Years followed, which included recordings by both line-ups. Built to Spill Caustic Resin, a split EP with Caustic Resin, was released in 1996. Between recording albums in 1995, the band gained exposure by playing on the Lollapalooza tour.\n\nMartsch signed Built to Spill to Warner Bros. Records in 1995. Unlike many artists signed to major labels, the deal the band brokered with Warner Bros. allowed it to retain a large degree of creative control over future albums. Built to Spill produced its first major label release in 1997 with Perfect from Now On. By this time, the band consisted of Martsch, Nelson, Netson, and Scott Plouf. Perfect from Now On met with critical success and caused Built to Spill to become one of the United States' most recognizable indie rock bands. Before releasing another album, Martsch made Nelson and Plouf permanent members of the band. In 1999, the band released Keep It Like a Secret to continued critical success, and for the first time, significant commercial success. Live was released in 2000, and the band's fifth studio album, Ancient Melodies of the Future, was released in 2001.\n\nIn 2002, Martsch released Now You Know, a solo album with both blues and folk elements. He performed numerous solo concerts in support of the album. Built to Spill was on hiatus for most of this period.\n\n\nWarner Bros. Records optioned the band for another album.[2] From 2003 to 2005, Built to Spill toured extensively, performing over 150 dates.[3] The shows included new songs as early as 2004. Their sixth studio album, You in Reverse, was recorded in Portland in 2004, but was not released until April 11, 2006. The band's official lineup for the album was Martsch, Nelson, Plouf, and Jim Roth, who was formerly only a touring guitarist. Brett Netson provided guitar work on several songs and later rejoined the band as a full-time member.\n\nAfter the release of You in Reverse, Built to Spill continued touring almost non-stop. In March 2006, Martsch suffered a detached retina which required surgery. This forced the band to miss an appearance at the South by Southwest music festival and postpone several dates of the tour.[4] More bad news came when former drummer Andy Capps was found dead on May 18, 2006.[citation needed]\n\nThe band resumed touring on June 3, 2006, a show that included four new songs. This show and many on the tour included the dedication of the song &quot;Car&quot; to Capps, who had played on the track when it was recorded.[5]\n\nWarner Bros. Records stated that Built to Spill had been recording for their follow-up to You in Reverse on and off during the 2006 tour,[6] but nothing appeared until the July 10, 2007 release of a 12&quot; single, &quot;They Got Away&quot;/&quot;Re-Arrange.&quot; &quot;They Got Away&quot; was a heavily reggae-influenced original song, while &quot;Re-Arrange&quot; is a cover of a song by the reggae band The Gladiators.\n\nThe U.S. tour was scheduled through October 2007, after which the band toured Australia. Martsch stated in a September 2007 interview that he didn't want to tour in the United States again until the band records;[7] however, the band then announced a one-month U.S. national tour for spring of 2008.[8]\n\nIn a March 2008 interview with Playback:stl,[9] Doug Martsch stated that a side project of his has been new Halo Benders material, but &quot;we started that about a year ago, we have not even got anything off the ground.&quot; Later in the interview, Martsch gave his perspective on the future of Built to Spill past the current material; &quot;I do think that Built to Spill could be something better than ever just because our lineup is better than ever ... I think there is potential for the five of us to collaborate on something that is just way better than anything that I have ever come up with by myself or that we have done in the past.&quot; Martsch also interjects that &quot;This coming record we're not doing that--it's mostly going to be songs that I have been working on.&quot;\n\nThe band extended its 2008 tour in the United States and Europe, performing the album Perfect From Now On in its entirety.\n\nThe tracklist and album art for There Is No Enemy were revealed on August 17th, 2009, and on September 8th, the first single, &quot;Hindsight,&quot; was released.\n\nBuilt to Spill played the 2009 Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago, along with Yo La Tengo, Tortoise and The Jesus Lizard, as part of the &quot;Write the Night&quot; series, which allowed fans to choose which songs the bands play.\n\nThe band began an extensive United States tour on August 20th, 2009.\n\nBuilt to Spill release its seventh LP, titled There Is No Enemy, on October 6, 2009.[1] The album is now streaming in its entirety at\n\nMartsch has cited Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis' style of heavy, catchy guitar hooks as an influence on what has come to be Built to Spill's call sign. The band has also cited Neil Young, Pavement and Camper Van Beethoven as influences. Built to Spill has been cited as an important influence for fellow rockers The Ataris, Modest Mouse, The Strokes, and Death Cab for Cutie; Isaac Brock and Ben Gibbard have both cited Built to Spill and Treepeople as major influences, and all three bands have had a lengthy association with the indie rock movement known as the Northwest sound. Additionally, Built to Spill is connected with other Northwest bands including Brett Netson's band Caustic Resin and The Halo Benders, a collaboration between Martsch, Calvin Johnson, Steve Fisk, and one-time Built to Spill drummer Ralph Youtz.\n\nMany of Built to Spill's influences can be found in their choice of cover songs. The band has performed live covers by Elliott Smith, David Bowie, Camper Van Beethoven, The Cure, Captain Beefheart, Caustic Resin, Cheap Trick, The Clash, Brian Eno, Vince Guaraldi, The Gladiators, M.I.A., Macy Gray, Elton John, George Harrison, Skip James, Daniel Johnston, John Lennon, Love as Laughter, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Marine Research, Steve Miller, Modest Mouse, Ozzy Osbourne, The Smiths, The Strokes, Talking Heads, The Velvet Underground, and Neil Young. Martsch also played several other covers on his solo tour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimate Alternative Wavers 1993\n\n\nUltimate Alternative Wavers was the first full-length album released by indie rock band Built to Spill. The line-up consisted of Doug Martsch on guitar and vocals, Brett Netson on guitar and bass, and Ralf Youtz on drums, although there was some variation in instrumentation on a few tracks. The album was recorded at Audio Lab in Boise, Idaho in the fall of 1992, and released in 1993 on the C/Z Records label. It eventually went out-of-print, but was re-released in late 2006. The song title 'Nowhere Nothin' Fuckup' is the title of a song by the main character, James Tarverner, in Philip K. Dick's Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said. The song's lyrics, also, are in large part borrowed from The Velvet Underground's &quot;Oh! Sweet Nuthin'&quot;.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;The First Song&quot; (4:02)\n2.\t&quot;Three Years Ago Today&quot; (3:56)\n3.\t&quot;Revolution&quot; (4:25)\n4.\t&quot;Shameful Dread&quot; (8:29)\n5.\t&quot;Nowhere Nothin' Fuckup&quot; (6:34)\n6.\t&quot;Get a Life&quot; (5:53)\n7.\t&quot;Built to Spill&quot; (5:52)\n8.\t&quot;Lie for a Lie&quot; (3:16)\n9.\t&quot;Hazy&quot; (6:42)\n10.\t&quot;Built Too Long Parts 1, 2 &amp; 3&quot; (9:24)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep it Like a Secret 1999\n\n\n\nKeep It Like a Secret was the fourth full-length album released by indie rock band Built to Spill, and their second for Warner Bros.

The album was recorded at Bear Creek studios in Woodinville, Washington by Phil Ek, with overdubs at Avast! Recording Co. in Seattle, Washington.
