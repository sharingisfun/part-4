The House of Windsor: Death of Queen Victoria, to present day. Speculation on the path of King Charles III or King George VII. This single extended episode completes the series. THIS EPISODE IS MISSING\n\n\nREPLACEMENT SERIES\n\nThe House of Windsor: A Royal Dynasty - George V, Edward VIII, George VI and Elizabeth II\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.suite101.com/content/the-house-of-windsor-a-royal-dynasty-a94476&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.suite101.com/content/the-house-of-windsor-a-royal-dynasty-a94476&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nBritainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Royal family are still relevant today, as they were nearly a century ago, in this new three-part series. The Windsor monarchs, with the exception of Edward VIII, put service and duty towards their country and the Commonwealth \n\nbefore their own personal interests.\n\nThe House of Windsor: A Royal Dynasty chronicles the Royal FamilyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lives from the late Victorian era to the present day. They, like their subjects, have celebrated the good times and shared sorrows against major events during the past \n\nninety years. Archival footage includes rare coloured film of George VÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Silver Jubilee, George VIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s coronation and a Royal Tour of Canada.\n\nTheir story began when George V changed the family name of three generations ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the German-sounding Saxe-Coburg-Gotha ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ to the very English Windsor during World War IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s darkest days.\n\nThe film also recalls how George V embraced the power of radio to reach out to all his subjects in Britain and abroad. Millions heard his speech on Empire Day. Edward VIII explains why he abdicated in a radio broadcast in December 1936. \n\nGeorge VI used radio broadcasts to address the nation, especially when war was declared in 1939, to boost morale, and to thank his subjects when it ended. (Newsreels show George VI and his queen Elizabeth visiting Londoners whose homes \n\nwere bombed during the Blitz.) Changes in technology meant Elizabeth IIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s coronation was the first to be televised and broadcast. The QueenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life now becomes public property. This documentary also reveals the Royal FamilyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reaction to \n\nPrincess DianaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death and how the public intruded upon their personal grief. Other highlights include a brief interview with the Duke and Duchess of Windsor from the 1960s. Edward, as Prince of Wales wanted to be regarded as an honorary \n\nCanadian! Australian cricketing captain Don Bradman gives his opinion about Prince PhilipÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s talents as an off-spin bowler!\n\nEpisode 1 - The First Windsors\n\nGeorge V and his queen Mary were a deeply conservative couple who were slow to embrace the new. EdwardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s womanising and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcalling in sickÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for really boring assignments gave George V cause for worry.\n\nEdward VIII abdicated after a ten-month reign.\n\nEpisode 2 - The King Who Saved The Crown\n\nBertie, Duke of York, was the most unlikely man to become King. He was shy, he stammered and he hated public occasions. He was compelled to step up and do his royal duty when his brother abdicated.\n\nHe steered Britain though the Abdication crisis, the devastation of World War II and he restored stability to the monarchy. His daughter, Princess Elizabeth, was perfectly prepared for her future role when he died from cancer in 1952.\n\nEpisode 3 - A Queen For All Seasons\n\nElizabeth II was only 25 when she became Queen. She was also a wife and mother, as she married Prince Philip in a lavish ceremony in November 1947.\n\nShe saw many changes, including the Swinging Sixties, four failed marriages, DianaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death in 1997, and the loss of her sister and mother. She ruled with calm authority, even in incredibly difficult situations.\n\nElizabeth II was hailed as a great survivorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½she celebrated her Golden Jubilee in 2002, and her 80th birthday in 2006.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1ba7783479e59c74841767bd2cb8caf5b8b2ce1","amp;dn":"Monarchy+-+BBC+Docu+-+David+Starkey+-+History+of+UK+Monarchs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1ba7783479e59c74841767bd2cb8caf5b8b2ce1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,186,119,131,71,158,89,199,72,65,118,123,210,203,140,175,91,139,44,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
