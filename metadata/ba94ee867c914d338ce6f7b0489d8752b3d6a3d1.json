This is the comprehensive guide to Ontario s craft-beer revival and the brewers behind it. The renaissance of craft beer that has swept North America over the past thirty years has transformed the Ontario landscape, leaving over two hundred breweries, both great and humble, dotting the province. The diversity of craft beers we now enjoy is unprecedented in history and dazzling to behold. For the growing number of people who find their interest piqued, the sheer selection of brews can be intimidating. &quot;The Ontario Craft Beer Guide&quot; gives readers, whether bright-eyed beginners or aficionados of the highest calibre, a dependable field guide to the beers of Ontario. Noted experts Jordan St. John (&quot;Lost Breweries of Toronto&quot;) and Robin LeBlanc (&quot;The Thirsty Wench&quot;) tell the stories of some of Ontario s most notable breweries and provide expert ratings for nearly a thousand beers.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba94ee867c914d338ce6f7b0489d8752b3d6a3d1","amp;dn":"The+Ontario+Craft+Beer+Guide+%282016%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba94ee867c914d338ce6f7b0489d8752b3d6a3d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,148,238,134,124,145,77,51,140,230,247,176,72,157,135,82,179,214,163,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
