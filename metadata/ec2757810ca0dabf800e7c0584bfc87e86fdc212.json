As an MC, Kweli is still as incisive as ever--his distinctive, darting flow stabs its way across every song and, as one of hip-hop&amp;#039;s better thinkers, he covers a wide range of moods and ideas. As a verbal ass-whupper, Kweli unloads on songs like &quot;Rush,&quot; &quot;Shock Body,&quot; and &quot;Guerrilla Monsoon Rap&quot; (featuring the Roots&amp;#039; Black Thought and Pharoahe Monch), but he takes things much further than just the lyricist&amp;#039;s lounge. &quot;Get By,&quot; produced beautifully by Kayne West, is the conscious hustler&amp;#039;s anthem, while &quot;Where Do We Go&quot; muses on death as thoughtfully and introspectively as &quot;Joy&quot; (with Mos Def) delves into the wonders of birth. &quot;The Proud&quot; tackles American jingoism in a time of terror, providing a much needed dose of skepticism when patriotic sentimentalism has free reign.\n\nTracklist:\n\n 1.
