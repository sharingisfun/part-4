In particular, the book discusses important drivers for change, including:\n\nUsing more natural chemicals or physical treatments to replace synthetic chemicals\nIncreasing the efficiency of older, more traditional methods in combination with newer biocontrol treatments\nLeveraging a range of biomolecular research tools or &quot;omics&quot; to efficiently gather and assess mass information at molecular, enzymic, and genetic levels\nUsing modelling systems to identify key changes and control points for better targeting of new treatments and solutions to postharvest problems\nThe postharvest handling of fresh fruits and vegetables plays a critical role in facilitating a continuous supply of high-quality fresh produce to the consumer. Many new technologies developed and refined in recent years continue to make possible an ever-expanding supply of fresh products. This volume examines a range of recently developed technologies and systems that will help the horticulture industry to become more environmentally sustainable and economically competitive, and to minimize postharvest quality loss and generate products that are appealing and acceptable to consumers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e63c8ee6ab2e2df0abc749daff188b65b0a41e9","amp;dn":"Advances+in+Postharvest+Fruit+and+Vegetable+Technology+-+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e63c8ee6ab2e2df0abc749daff188b65b0a41e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,99,200,238,106,178,226,223,10,188,116,157,175,241,136,182,91,10,65,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
