She persuades Bill Emerson (played by Ford) to take her home in his boat. Their relationship grows while she paints a portrait of Eben Folger (Walter Brennan), the old lighthouse keeper, and Kate is very much in love.\n\nHowever, her sister Pat (also played by Davis) happens to be a twin. A flamboyant, man-hungry manipulator, she fools Bill at first, pretending to be Kate. Then she pursues him on a trip out of town, and they return announcing to Kate their intention to marry.\n\nKate focuses on her work with artist Karnock (Dane Clark), but rejects his romantic overtures. Bill eventually goes to Chile, allowing Kate to spend some time with her sister and learn that the marriage is in trouble. When they go sailing, Pat is washed overboard and drowns. Kate is washed ashore, and, when she regains consciousness, she is mistaken for Patricia.\n\nBill is about to return, so Kate decides to assume her late sister's identity. Bill is angry at Pat's many affairs and in no mood to continue the marriage. Freddie (Charles Ruggles) has guessed the truth and insists that Kate must reveal to Bill her real identity. When she does, Bill realizes that Kate is the one he truly loves.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Bitrate: 1295 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime: 109 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]   \nDuration: 109 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d258a96f53175737d1c917047ca4b01fd33836d","amp;dn":"A+Stolen+Life+%281946%29+Xvid+1cd+-+Glenn+Ford%2C+Bette+Davis+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d258a96f53175737d1c917047ca4b01fd33836d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,37,138,150,245,49,117,115,125,28,145,112,71,202,75,1,253,51,131,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
