Its name comes from the voice procedure term &quot;wilco&quot; meaning &quot;will comply&quot;. The band was formed in 1994 by the remaining members of alternative country group Uncle Tupelo following singer Jay Farrar's departure. The band continued in the alternative country of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album A.M. (1995), but has since introduced more experimental aspects to their music, including elements of alternative rock, and classic pop.\n\nWilco's lineup has changed frequently, with only singer Jeff Tweedy and bassist John Stirratt remaining from the original incarnation. Since early 2004, the other current members are guitarist Nels Cline, multi-instrumentalists Pat Sansone and Mikael Jorgensen, and drummer Glenn Kotche. Wilco has released seven studio albums, a live double album, and three collaborations: two with Billy Bragg, and one with The Minus 5.\n\n(source: Wikipedia)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efd2d9ba037c8a69dc51e670d97d08044420f1ac","amp;dn":"Wilco","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efd2d9ba037c8a69dc51e670d97d08044420f1ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,210,217,186,3,124,138,105,220,81,230,112,217,125,8,4,68,32,241,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
