That's \n        why, even with her place in the world's \n        musical elite guaranteed and undisputed, the \n        only way is UP! for Shania Twain, because of the \n        creative goals she has already achieved with the \n        album even before it starts flying out of the \n        stores. &amp;quot;Mutt and I as a team put more into this \n        record than ever before,&amp;quot; she confesses. &amp;quot;We \n        really have gone totally all out, we've laboured \n        over it and I'm completely thrilled with the \n        results.&amp;quot; \n\n        Her new single &amp;quot;Party for two&amp;quot; is released in \n        two versions,a country version featuring Billy \n        Currington and a pop version featuring Mark \n        McGrath. The Greatest hits Collection also \n        features 2 new recordings. \n\n        &amp;quot;I put this music on and I'm overwhelmed with \n        emotion. It's been such a labour of love, and as \n        I'm listening back sometimes I don't know \n        whether to laugh or cry.&amp;quot; \n\n                SCREW THE INDUSTRY!!!!
