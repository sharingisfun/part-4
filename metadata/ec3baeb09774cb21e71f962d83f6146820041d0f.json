Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and raised in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the 1970s and 1980s, after forming the band Taste during the late 1960s. He was a talented guitarist known for his charismatic performances and dedication to his craft. Gallagher's albums have sold in excess of 30 million copies worldwide. A heavy drinker for most of his adult life, Gallagher received a liver transplant in 1995, but died of complications later that year in London, UK at the age of 47.\n\nIn the later years of his life Gallagher developed a phobia of flying. To overcome this he received a prescription for a powerful sedative. This medication, combined with his alcohol use resulted in severe liver damage. Despite this he continued touring. By the time of his final performance on 10 January 1995 in the Netherlands, he was visibly sick and the tour had to be cancelled. Gallagher was admitted to King's College Hospital in London in March 1995, and it was only then that the extent of his ill health became apparent: his liver was failing and the doctors determined that in spite of his young age a liver transplant was the only possible course of action. After 13 weeks in intensive care, while waiting to be transferred to a convalescent home, his health suddenly worsened when he contracted a staphylococcal (MRSA) infection, and he died on 14 June 1995, at the age of 47. He was unmarried and had no children.\n\nGallagher was buried in St Oliver's Cemetery, on the Clash Road just outside Ballincollig near Cork City, Ireland. His headstone is a replica of an award he received in 1972 for International Guitarist of the Year","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec3baeb09774cb21e71f962d83f6146820041d0f","amp;dn":"Rory+Gallagher%2FIrishman+In+New+York+%5B2CD%27s%5D%5B1979%2F2015%5D%5B320KBP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec3baeb09774cb21e71f962d83f6146820041d0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,59,174,176,151,116,203,33,231,31,150,45,131,246,20,104,32,4,29,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
