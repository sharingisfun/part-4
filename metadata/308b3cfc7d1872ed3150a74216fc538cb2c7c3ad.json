For better or for worse, 2015Ãƒâ€ s Wild Ones mostly feels like a continuation of MooreÃƒâ€ s work from that perception, with anthems and ballads alike expanding upon themes centered around partying, girls, pistols, sex, beer, and trucks. Where Moore breaks from his the traditional mold that he had enveloped himself around during the elongated Up All Night era (Moore had trashed an entire albumÃƒâ€ s worth of material and redone it to get where he is now with his sophomore effort) all lies within the composition. Largely moving away from the slow-burning, sometimes brooding arrangements of his debut, Moore grips a significantly more upbeat instrumentation by the horns in this latest release.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
