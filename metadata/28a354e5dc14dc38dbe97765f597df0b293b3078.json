Dr. Cousens is a well known holistic medical doctor, as well as an \n    authority on alternative healing and raw living food nutritional therapies. \n    Medical discussions and group support meetings were held daily and medical \n    checks conducted twice a day. The participants are encouraged to exercise, \n    practice yoga and meditation, and are taught about food selection and \n    preparation.\n\n    Reactions varied to this regime. All experienced a variety of emotions \n    about the new diet and new lifestyle that they were immersed in. Some \n    adapted to the changes more easily, others expressed feelings of deprivation \n    and frustration with the shift from their familiar diet and environment. \n    After a short time following the protocol, their blood sugar levels began \n    dropping without medication and they were delighted as their bodies felt \n    better and their minds experienced a deeper clarity. They began to believe \n    that it was possible to reverse their disease with diet and the \n    transformation from feeling powerless about their diabetes, to feeling \n    empowered and healthy, emerges as they witness dramatic changes within \n    themselves.\n\n    Simply Raw reveals, with startling clarity, that diet can reverse diabetes* \n    and change the quality of peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lives. The film captures the human drama \n    and struggle of these courageous individuals making a quantum leap of faith \n    from a traditional junk food diet to a raw vegan diet and it shows revealing \n    moments of nurturing, compassion, and human spirit. It is a film about a \n    life changing journey on a simply raw diet and how nature is the original \n    medicine.\n\nNotes:\n\n    This film has been transcoded from non-free formats to free container, \n    video, and audio codecs due to the serious nature of the inherent social \n    and ethical problems created through the use of proprietary software and \n    media formats.
