A singer, composer and occasional actress, Lisa brings a vision that is both precise and all-embracing to everything she does.\n\nBy the mid-90s, even the ambition of Dead Can Dance was no longer broad enough to encompass Lisa&amp;#039;s musical vision. 1995 saw the release of her solo debut, The Mirror Pool, for which she was accompanied by the Victoria Philharmonic Orchestra. Again, it&amp;#039;s an album that defies categorisation, causing one impressed but perplexed reviewer to describe it as &quot;ambient, orchestral, folk and new age all at the same time.&quot; Duality, a collaboration with Pieter Bourke followed in 1998 and again transcended musical eras and genres. Six years later came the stunningly beautiful Immortal Memory - another joint effort, this time with the Irish composer Patrick Cassidy.\n\n\n1.
