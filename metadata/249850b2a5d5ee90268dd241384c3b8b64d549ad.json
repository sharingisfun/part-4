Nevertheless, he received accolades and state awards and served in the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR (1947Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1962) and the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union (from 1962 until his death).\n\nAfter a period influenced by Sergei Prokofiev and Igor Stravinsky, Shostakovich developed a hybrid style, as exemplified by Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (1934). This single work juxtaposed a wide variety of trends, including the neo-classical style (showing the influence of Stravinsky) and post-Romanticism (after Gustav Mahler). Sharp contrasts and elements of the grotesque[2] characterize much of his music.\n\nShostakovich's orchestral works include 15 symphonies and six concerti. His chamber output includes 15 string quartets, a piano quintet, two piano trios, and two pieces for string octet. His piano works include two solo sonatas, an early set of preludes, and a later set of 24 preludes and fugues. Other works include three operas, several song cycles, ballets, and a substantial quantity of film music; especially well known is The Second Waltz, Op. 99, music to the film The First Echelon (1955Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1956).[\n\nAlbumList:\nDmitry Shostakovich - Preludes and Ballet Suites (SACD-R)\nDmitry Shostakovich - Symp. 3&amp;10 - Gergiev Mariinsky Orchestra Chorus iso\nDmitry Shostakovich - Symp. 4 -Gergiev   Philips SACD ISO\nDmitry Shostakovich - Symp. 5&amp;9- Gergiev  Philips SACD ISO\nDmitry Shostakovich Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Symp. 7 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ RCO Ã¢â‚¬â€œ RCO Live 06002 (2006) SACD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:249850b2a5d5ee90268dd241384c3b8b64d549ad","amp;dn":"Dmitry+Shostakovich++5+SACD-R%27s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"249850b2a5d5ee90268dd241384c3b8b64d549ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,152,80,178,165,213,238,144,38,141,210,65,56,76,59,139,100,213,73,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
