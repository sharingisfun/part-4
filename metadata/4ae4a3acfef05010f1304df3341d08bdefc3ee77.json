The potential of solar energy (being the most abundant) in fulfilling part of the energy requirements of mankind is immense and constitutes the focal point of this book. A self-powered solar tracker that points directly towards the sun by means of an integrated control mechanism with two degrees of rotational freedom was studied and developed. The electro-mechanical control system is based on a precisely-timed microcontroller circuit that first computes the altitude and azimuth of the sun in real-time and then drives a pair of stepper motors that steer the solar tracker towards it. A locally built fibre-glass parabolic dish, the surface of which is lined with a reflective vinyl mirror film, serves to concentrate solar rays on its surface","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ae4a3acfef05010f1304df3341d08bdefc3ee77","amp;dn":"Tracking+Solar+Concentrators+-+A+Low+Budget+Solution","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ae4a3acfef05010f1304df3341d08bdefc3ee77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,228,163,172,254,240,80,16,241,48,77,243,52,29,8,189,239,195,238,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
