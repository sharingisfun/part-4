The album was released early in 1997, perfectly blending traditional post-WWII Chicago blues with a few blues-rock riffs from the 1970s and '80s thrown in. Songs like &quot;Young Boy's Blues,&quot; &quot;When I'm Lonely&quot; and &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; demonstrate a refreshing approach to blues songwriting reminiscent of Louisiana bluesman Larry Garner. ~ Richard Skelly\n\nTracklist\n\n1.
