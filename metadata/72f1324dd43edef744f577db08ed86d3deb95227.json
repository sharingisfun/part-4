Many of the albums I actually bought in India, some I purchased in the USA, and a few I downloaded a while ago.\n\nIf you like Indian Classical music, please type a search for another torrent I have posted ?L. Shankar?\n\nPLEASE SEED TO A 1/1 RATIO! If everyone gives back what they take, a torrent should stay alive, right?  I intend to seed for as long as I can, with some vacations particularly in late Dec. 06, and early Jan. 07, so please have confidence even if it doesn?t come through right away.\n\nI am still new at this so any suggestions will be appreciated!  Enjoy.    \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72f1324dd43edef744f577db08ed86d3deb95227","amp;dn":"Indian+Classical%2C+Folk%2C+and+Fusion+%28Raga%2C+etc.%29+Sitar%2C+Bansuri%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72f1324dd43edef744f577db08ed86d3deb95227","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,241,50,77,212,62,222,247,68,245,119,219,8,237,134,211,222,185,82,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
