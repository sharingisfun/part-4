Players choose a vehicle, and an arenaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or a series of arenas in the story modeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to engage in battle with opposing drivers. A variety of weapons and upgrades are obtainable by pick-ups scattered throughout the stage. The last driver alive is the winner.\n\nAlthough each individual game features its own storyline, they all revolve around the same basic theme: a vehicular combat tournament called Twisted Metal is presented with the promise of granting the contest\\'s winner any single wish they so desire. In almost all of the games, the host is a man called \\&quot;Calypso\\&quot;; however, in the series\\' fourth installment, perennial contestant Sweet Tooth briefly takes over.\n\nThe hosts of these games are the persons who are, through arcane means, capable of warping reality itself to grant the wish of the contest winner; however, there is a general \\&quot;be careful what you wish for\\&quot; theme in the game series, as nearly all of the winning contestants end up with \\&quot;not-so-happy\\&quot; endings, due to the skill and proclivity of the hosts for twisting the words of their wish aroundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½often to deadly effect. The games in the series usually contain a healthy dose of black humor.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHELP ME SEED MY LOW-SEEDED TORRENTS SO I CAN UPLOAD MORE AND NOT WORRY ABOUT THE OLD ONES!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDon\\'t forget to snag a copy of my Land of the Dead torrent (you can play it online).\n\n\nI HAVE A FEW ONLINE PLAYABLE TORRENTS SO FAR:\nLand of the Dead\nPostal 1 and Postal 2 Share The Pain (All Mods)\nSniper Elite\nSerious Sam: The First and Second Encounter\nNexuiz\nDoom Collection (all the older doom games)  NOTE: This Requires a mod to play online (skulltag), it\\'s free, google it\nOTHERS CAN MOST LIKELY BE PLAYED VIA HAMACHI\n\n\nDOWNLOAD ALL MY TORRENTS HERE:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fef6889e1cbeb09584de30d21e6c7526d19afac9","amp;dn":"Twisted++Metal+1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4%2C+and+Small+Brawl+%28PSX+PS1%29+%28Full+Colle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fef6889e1cbeb09584de30d21e6c7526d19afac9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,246,136,158,28,190,176,149,132,222,48,210,30,108,117,38,209,154,250,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
