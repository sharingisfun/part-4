Rob Papen himself called it Ã¢â‚¬ËœCross-fusion synthesisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ since it covered so much musical ground so effectively.\n\nToday BLUE-II remains true to that ethos with even more sound dimensions and features to its extended name, starting with six oscillators beating at its musically creative heart. These can be connected in various ways, together with two analogue-style modelled stereo filters with 27 different filter types, an enormous range of processing and modulation options, sequencer, and an incredibly powerful arpeggiator. A new range of specially selected waveforms based on samples have been meticulously fashioned for creating new and fresh-sounding synth sounds, so donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go expecting acoustic pianos galore here. However, since choirs and strings are an excellent basis for so many synth sounds BLUE-II has them in abundance Ã¢â‚¬â€ with much more besides!\n\nMoreover, BLUE-II takes the useful XY pad features from its popular virtual instrument sibling Blade Ã¢â‚¬â€ a cutting-edge additive synthesis powerhouse with a human touch Ã¢â‚¬â€ and transplants them into its own equally extraordinary workflowÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ perfect for time-based sound movements and vector pad-type sounds. Complemented by four top-quality FX processors, each offering 35 FX types, BLUE-II is a phenomenally powerful virtual instrument to behold.\n\nBut BLUE-II is also easy to use, thanks to its user-friendly user interface and an innovative Easy Edit page for speedy sound changes, while the Bank Manager allows whistle-stop navigation through thousands of inspirational Rob Papen presets and artist sound banks covering a wide range of musical styles.\n\nBLUE-II represents an amazing journey into Ã¢â‚¬ËœCross-fusion synthesisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and, quite simply, sounds stunning!\n\n\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n\n\nSix Oscillators modules which include Analogue, Additive and Spectral type waveforms.\nOsc. A and B offer PWM modulation and symmetry control.\nOscillators can be combined in several ways using 32 different modulation routings in the Algorithm screen.\nOscillators can have FM modulation or Ring modulation and can be oscillator hard synced.\nEach oscillator can be output to the filters, the effects or output as dry.\nDedicated screens available in the LCD screen section for Algorithm selection, Phase distortion / Wave shaping settings and Oscillator Envelopes\n&gt;Two analogue modelled stereo Multimode filters, offering 6dB LowPass/HighPass, 12dB and 24dB LowPass/HighPass/BandPass/Notch, Ring, Comb and Vox (formant).\nFilters with panning, panning modulation options and pre-filtering distortion.\nEasy filter control by pre-defined modulation controllers like Envelope, Velocity, Keytrack and Modulation Wheel Nine Envelopes, AHDSFR type.\n&gt;Direct connection to the Oscillators volume, Filters frequency and main Volume amp to make sound editing fast and easy. Graphic and fader-control of Envelopes in one go.\nDynamic curves and midi tempo based features like delay and envelope retrigger.\n&gt;Four Multi-Envelopes, These free highly sophisticated envelopes can be built up using up to 16 sections. Full graphic control and additional menus with presets, load and save functions. Dynamic curves and midi tempo based functions\nTen LFOs with various waveforms and are midi-syncable. Directly connected to main targets to make sound editing easy and fast. Directly connected LFO's for PWM A/B, Filter Frequency A/B, Tremolo (amp), Vibrato (main pitch) and Three Free LFOs. LFO have adjustable, free/poly/mono modes, keytracking, symmetry, smoothing, attack, decay and humanize functions.\n&gt;Three modulation Step-sequencers with sequence loop start/end, poly/mono/free play modes, speed controls and step smooth function. Copy/paste/clear functions.\n&gt;Modulation Matrix with 2 pages of 10 slots. 12 synth sources &amp; 23 midi sources and 91 synth destinations.\n&gt;32 step mono sequencer, with sequencer length, speed adjust, slide amount, swing amount, volume smoothing. Each step has On/off, Reset, -32/+32 Semitune, - Volume, Slide on/off, Filter A, Filter B and Free modulation settings. Clear, load and save functions to exchange sequences in between presets.\n&gt;32 step arpeggiator, with sequencer, seq length, speed adjust, slide amount, swing amount and step length control. Each step has On/off, Slide on/off, Reset, -32/+32 Semitone, Step length, Velocity, and Free modulation. Clear, load and save functions to exchange arpeggiators in between presets\n&gt;Poly/Mono/Legato/Seq/Arp synthesizer play modes. Portmento featuring legato, switch-able constant time/constant rate.\nUnison 2 / Unison 4 / Unison 6 mode with detuning Chord memory with strum function.\n&gt;Adjustable Precision setting per oscillator to simulate the instability of vintage analogue synthesizers. 16-voice polyphony. Voice amount control.\n&gt;Global settings save with each individual preset like: keyboard velocity response curve, over-sampling settings and filter control smoothing. Easy Edit page for fast new sound results or for easy access tempo changes. External controller hardware (fader-box or synth) settings can be saved and restored.\n&gt;Two HQ effects-blocks with serial and parallel mode. Available effects: Mono Delay, Stereo Delay, Chorus, Flanger, Phaser, Distortion, Low Fi, Stereo Widener, Reverb, Comb Filter, Gator, Speaker Simulator, Wah/Delay, Chorus/Delay, Autopan, Waveshaper, Ensemble and Compressor.

We have no idea why they still use it only for Win32. It just make loading slower and decrease compatibility.\n\n2.From RP-AMod, which is assumed to be released for testing their new protection, they add the C&amp;R protection to the formal serial number protection. Code is obfuscated with custom section and it would crash the debuger's trace functions.\n\n3.RP hardcode the 22,000 serials to DLL file. Your serial will be checked one by one (it means it checks 22,000 times), by 14 serial check routines. The 5MB of DLL is SHA1 hash data and you can see the lots of 40byte hash with your hex editor.\n\nIs the protection a way to toture the users?\n\n[Installation]\n\n     \n\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Uninstall previous versions.\n\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  UnRar and Install Rob Papen BLUE II v1.0.0b.\n           \n             \n\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
