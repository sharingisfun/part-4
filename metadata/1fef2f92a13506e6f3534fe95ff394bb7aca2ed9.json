They then demonstrate how to create a myriad of creative effects using diverse techniques such as stamping, stencilling, palette knife painting and much more.\n\n&quot;The Contemporary Buttercream Bible is an absolute game changer in the industry of cake art. I've never seen techniques and talent presented in such a way as to be concurrently hugely aspirational yet completely approachable. I look forward to learning all the skills that I, as an artist in rolled fondant, have only the most rudimentary grasp of. Not since Cakewalk by Margaret Braun have I been this excited about a cake book. Bravo!&quot; --Chef Duff Goldman from Ace of Cakes\n\n&quot;The authors' examples are inspirational and a demonstration of what is possible if you 'put your whole heart into it.' Overall, Valeriano and Ong have created a book full of inspiration and encouragement that re-energizes the use of buttercream in modern cake design.&quot; --Sonya Hong of Americancakedecorating.com.\n\nInternationally renowned Valeri Valeriano &amp; Christina Ong have over 60k online followers. www.queenofheartscouturecakes.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fef2f92a13506e6f3534fe95ff394bb7aca2ed9","amp;dn":"The+Contemporary+Buttercream+Bible+%28Baking%29+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fef2f92a13506e6f3534fe95ff394bb7aca2ed9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,239,47,146,161,53,6,230,243,83,79,233,95,243,148,187,122,202,46,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
