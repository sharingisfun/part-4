For most of us, that would be the end of our fight. If we were capable of thought while we tried to cope with the pain, weâ€™d probably hope to be rushed to hospital, so that someone could save our lives. But a hundred years ago, in the opening battle of World War I at Mons, two young men didnâ€™t react like that. Lieutenant Maurice Dease and Private Sidney Godley, born only weeks apart into sharply contrasting worlds, shared the same defiance. They didnâ€™t think of themselves and went back for more, sustaining dreadful wounds in the process. One man died, the other livedâ€”pieced back together painstakingly by the Germans, who had taken so many casualties of their own while overrunning the British position. Together Dease and Godley became the first winners of the Victoria Cross in World War I","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e18fd91defb6e5d1c62d199bc602e941d4d9011d","amp;dn":"The+First+VCs%3A+The+Moving+True+Story+of+First+World+War+Heroes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e18fd91defb6e5d1c62d199bc602e941d4d9011d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,143,217,29,239,182,229,209,198,45,25,155,198,2,233,65,212,217,1,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
