In particular, the album includes an alternate acoustic version of Poco's first hit, Jim Messina's &quot;You Better Think Twice&quot;, and four previously-unreleased songs from the Crazy Eyes sessions, including Furay's &quot;Believe Me&quot;, which later became a hit for the Souther-Hillman-Furay Band.
