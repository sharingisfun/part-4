Words are thematically ordered in  groups and written in English, pinyin and Chinese characters. Pronunciation is included within the website.\n\nMandarin vocabulary lists:\n\n01_Food and Drink\n02_The Physical World\n03_House and Household\n04_The Human Body\n05_Family and Relationship\n06_Business and Employment\n07_Clothes and Footwear\n08_Education\n09_Time and Calendar\n10_Culture and Art\n11_Leasure and Sports\n12_Perception\n13_Shapes and Size\n14_Communication and Computers\n15_Agriculture and Industry\n16_Towns and Buildings\n17_Transportation\n\n\nSome of the lists are especially useful because they include words (e.g. words associated with the Internet and communication) that are usually not found in regular textbooks. I used them to make my own flashcards for vocabulary and character practice.\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c141ecf202f042db0df5ceb360c27021aa0d582","amp;dn":"Mandarin-Chinese-Vocabulary---1000%2BWords-with-Pronunciation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c141ecf202f042db0df5ceb360c27021aa0d582","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,20,30,207,32,47,4,45,176,223,92,235,54,12,39,2,26,160,213,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
