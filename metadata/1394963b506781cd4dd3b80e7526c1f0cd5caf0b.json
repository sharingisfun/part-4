Verne (1828-1905) was a French writer who, along with English author H.G. Wells, is regarded as the &quot;Father of Science Fiction.&quot; He is best known for his novels A JOURNEY TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH (1864), FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON (1865), 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA (1869Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1870), A JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH (1871) AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS (1873) and THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND (1875). Verne wrote about space, air, and underwater travel before navigable aircraft and practical submarines were invented, and before any means of space travel had been devised. A number of his works have been made into feature films and his books remain popular and in print more than a century after his death.\n\nContents:\n\n1. 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea\n2.
