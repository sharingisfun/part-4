The story of the missing years and the journey that shaped the man who would be king. An epic Russian tragedy in comic form, this is unlike any Doom story you've ever seen.\n\nFive-time Eisner-nominated Best Writer Ed Brubaker turns his shadowy vision to Marvel's greatest villain, Victor Von Doom. With the phenomenal art of Pablo Raimondi, you will witness Doom's life from his earliest moments to the day he took the throne of Latveria. A dark and revealing examination of how an innocent boy grows up to be a tyrant - a new twist on an old legend - Books of Doom is a sweeping epic of tragedy, madness and destiny!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b11dfc83dd22ab8796cfee760372f89dd269a919","amp;dn":"BOOKS+OF+DOOM+01-06+%282006%29+%28Marvel%29+Complete+%28REQUESTED%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b11dfc83dd22ab8796cfee760372f89dd269a919","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,29,252,131,221,34,171,135,150,207,238,118,3,114,248,157,210,105,169,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
