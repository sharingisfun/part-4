You really would need very expensive speakers to hear the difference from FLAC.  Fuck the MP3; it's outdated and should never be used again.\n\nSource:  FLAC from TPB\nEncoding: MPEG-4 HE AAC v2\n\nEncoder Settings:  \nExtension: m4a\nQuality: Maximum\nBit rate: 48\nVBR:  On\nEncoder: Max 0.9.1\n\nAbout HE AAC v2:\n\nHigh Efficiency AAC v2 Profile ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ defined in 2006, uses AAC-LC, SBR, PS\n\nAdvanced Audio Coding is designed to be the successor of the MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3, known as MP3 format.  \n\nHE-AAC v2, a.k.a. aacPlus v2 or eAAC+, the combination of Parametric Stereo (PS) and HE-AAC; used for even lower bitrates; defined in 2004 and 2006\n\nAAC and HE-AAC are better than MP3 at low bit rates (typically less than 128 kilobits per second). This is especially true at very low bit rates where the superior stereo coding, pure MDCT, and better transform window sizes leave MP3 unable to compete.\n\nWhile the MP3 format has near-universal hardware and software support, primarily due to MP3 being the format of choice during the crucial first few years of widespread music file-sharing/distribution over the internet, AAC is a strong contender due to some unwavering industry support\n\nAbout the Album:\n\nMichael Jackson\nGreatest Hits (2009)\n\nMichael Jackson was unquestionably the biggest pop star of the '80s, and certainly one of the most popular recording artists of all time. In his prime, Jackson was an unstoppable juggernaut, possessed of all the tools to dominate the charts seemingly at will: an instantly identifiable voice, eye-popping dance moves, stunning musical versatility, and loads of sheer star power. His 1982 blockbuster Thriller became the biggest-selling album of all time (probably his best-known accomplishment), and he was the first black artist to find stardom on MTV, breaking down innumerable boundaries both for his race and for music video as an art form. Yet as Jackson's career began, very gradually, to descend from the dizzying heights of his peak years, most of the media's attention focused on his increasingly bizarre eccentricities; he was often depicted as a man-child in a state of arrested development, completely sheltered from adult reality by a life spent in show business. The snickering turned to scandal in 1993, when Jackson was accused of molesting a 13-year-old boy; although he categorically denied the charges, his out-of-court settlement failed to restore his tarnished image. He never quite escaped the stigma of those allegations, and while he continued to sell records at superstar-like levels, he didn't release them with enough frequency (or, many critics thought, inspiration) to once again become better known for his music than his private life. Whether as a pop icon or a tabloid caricature, Jackson always remained bigger than life.\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01. Scream\n02. Bad\n03. Black Or White\n04. Billie Jean\n05.
