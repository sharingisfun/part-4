These so far formally unpublished pieces were written by Oded Goldreich, some in collaboration with other scientists.\nThe articles included in this book essentially reflect the topical scope of the scientific career of Oded Goldreich now spanning three decades. In particular the topics dealt with include average-case complexity, complexity of approximation, derandomization, expander graphs, hashing functions, locally testable codes, machines that take advice, NP-completeness, one-way functions, probabilistically checkable proofs, proofs of knowledge, property testing, pseudorandomness, randomness extractors, sampling, trapdoor permutations, zero-knowledge, and non-iterative zero-knowledge.\nAll in all, this potpourri of studies in complexity and cryptography constitutes a most valuable contribution to the field of theoretical computer science centered around the personal achievements and views of one of its outstanding representatives","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80625727a68ce0f2cd8ed21bbf9cccb318cf6ef2","amp;dn":"Studies+in+Complexity+and+Cryptography+-+Oded+Goldreich","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80625727a68ce0f2cd8ed21bbf9cccb318cf6ef2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,98,87,39,166,140,224,242,205,142,210,27,191,156,204,179,24,207,110,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
