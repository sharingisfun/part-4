The wider implications of policy and design are examined through a series of case studies of new housing projects in the UK and the Netherlands.\n\nDutch interdisciplinary design and modern methods of construction are widely considered to be of the highest quality from which much can be learned and understood. This new guide offers architects the best practice for the design, policy and construction of new homes. The author considers proposals for the Thames Gateway and government incentives to create better quality housing, including the Ã‚Â£60,000 house and design reviews. The wider implications of skills and training of architects, planners, design professionals and those parties involved in housing are also addressed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e4145b29e9fe21df3a23b7326203bb23770ff06","amp;dn":"Design+Quality+in+New+Housing+-+Learning+from+The+Netherlands+%28A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e4145b29e9fe21df3a23b7326203bb23770ff06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,65,69,178,158,159,226,29,243,162,59,115,38,32,59,178,55,112,255,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
