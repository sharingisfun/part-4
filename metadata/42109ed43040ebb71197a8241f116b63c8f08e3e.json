We are all economists - when we work, save for the future, invest, pay taxes, and buy our groceries. Yet many of us feel lost when the subject arises. Award-winning professor Timothy Taylor tackles all the key questions and hot topics of both microeconomics and macroeconomics, including:\n\nWhy do budget deficits matter?\nWhat exactly does the Federal Reserve do?\nDoes globalization take jobs away from American workers?\nWhy is health insurance so costly?\n\n&quot;The Instant Economist&quot; offers the knowledge and sophistication to understand the issues - so you can understand and discuss economics on a personal, national, and global level.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42109ed43040ebb71197a8241f116b63c8f08e3e","amp;dn":"The+Instant+Economist+%28Timothy+Taylor%29+Retail+epub+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42109ed43040ebb71197a8241f116b63c8f08e3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,16,158,212,48,64,235,183,17,151,168,36,31,17,107,99,200,240,142,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
