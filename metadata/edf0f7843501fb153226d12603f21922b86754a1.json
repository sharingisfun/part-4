His onstage stories and shaggy dog tales have long entertained his fans, but his songs and his guitar provide the most direct line to their hearts. Considering his prominence on the rock 'n' roll landscape, Springsteen has spent remarkably little of his 40-year recording career speaking to the press. But when he does decide to sit down and talk, the conversations tend to be momentous. Q&amp;As with Bruce Springsteen reveal an artist with great insight and self-awareness, a student of music, an avid searcher, an astute observer of humanity from the boardwalk to America at large. Much has been written about the Boss, but few can be said to know the man as well as he knows himself, and the best of Springsteen's own words are collected here in Talk About a Dream. Gathering more than 30 different interviews spanning from 1973 to 2013, this volume captures his remarkable personalityÃ¢â‚¬â€one that takes interviews as seriously as making music. These eye-opening conversations chart SpringsteenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s development as an artist, a thinker, and a public figure, shedding light on everything from the meaning of lyrics to his evolution from rebel rocker to global icon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edf0f7843501fb153226d12603f21922b86754a1","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen-+Talk+About+a+Dream+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edf0f7843501fb153226d12603f21922b86754a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,240,247,132,53,1,251,21,50,38,209,38,3,242,25,34,184,103,84,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
