The US violist and the Norwegian saxophonist have each made important contributions to KaraindrouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music in the past, Garbarek with his playing on the film-score for The Beekeeper (see Ã¢â‚¬Å“Music for FilmsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and Kashkashian as the key musical protagonist of Ã¢â‚¬Å“UlyssesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ GazeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Themes of both those films are revisited here, amongst much that is new. A primary emphasis is music written for theatre: the wide-reaching emotional scope of pieces for plays by Arthur Miller, Tennesee Williams and Edward Albee provides a wonderful context for bringing the guest musicians into contact with EleniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soloists, above all the brilliant oboist Vangelis Christopoulos. Recorded November 2010, with Manfred Eicher as producer, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Concert in AthensÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ gives us perhaps the fullest picture of Eleni KaraindrouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s compositional creativity to date.\n\n\nProject:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Each of my compositions seems to be part of a mosaic which takes on its ultimate form very slowly through the yearsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Eleni Karaindrou once said, and the larger picture becomes both clearer and more finely-detailed with each new album. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Concert in AthensÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is her tenth release on ECM. It is an exceptional documentation of a performance from 2010, marking a triumphant return to the Athens Concert Hall, the setting for the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Elegy of the UprootingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ shows five years earlier.\n\nA new programme offers new insights, particularly when participating friends include guest soloists Jan Garbarek and Kim Kashkashian, both of whom have made major contributions to the realization of KaraindrouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work in the past Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Garbarek with his evocative playing of the themes for The Beekeeper (reprised on the album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Music for FilmsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and Karaindrou as the key musical protagonist of UlyssesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Gaze. Over the years both artists have periodically returned to join Eleni for special events.\n\nUlyssesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Gaze and Beekeeper themes are reprised here, along with music from other films of the late Theo Angelopoulos Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dust of Time, Eternity and a Day, Landscape in the Mist and Journey to Cythera, all of them revealing new facets as Kashkashian and Garbarek are featured alongside EleniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s team of soloists (with oboist Vangelis Christopoloulos especially striking). There is also much here that is new or heard on CD for the first time including compositions originally written for theatre productions directed by Antonis Antypas including WhoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s afraid of Virginia Woolf? by Edward Albee, The Glass Menagerie by Tennessee Williams as well as Jules DassinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s production of Arthur MillerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Death of a Salesman. The differing demands of the theatre music open up a new emotional range for the soloists to explore.\n\nEleni: Ã¢â‚¬Å“I sought to share with them memories from past and more recent voyages in the worlds of theatre and poetry. With Jan I plunged deep into the fascination and torment of Arthur Miller, of Edward Albee and Tennessee Williams...Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The album opens and closes with GarbarekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intensely brooding saxophone, accompanied by KaraindrouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s piano and the string orchestra, playing the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Requiem for Willie LomanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from Death of a Salesman. Meanwhile, Ã¢â‚¬Å“KimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sturdy and sensitive bow swept us on a journey to LauraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fragile world in The Glass Menagerie, having first traversed the Closed Roads [one of several newly-arranged pieces of Karaindrou concert music] with all the passion and unmatched internal nobility which distinguish her work.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The scope of the music is further expanded with three charming miniatures inspired by M. KaragatsisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ novel Ã¢â‚¬Å“Number TenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and written for the Greek television series of the same name.\n\n\nBio:\n\nEleni Karaindrou was born in the Greek mountain village of Teichio.

In 2002 she received the Golden Cross of the Order of Honor from the Greek president, for her lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work. In 2004 she was nominated for the European Film Award for her music for Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Weeping MeadowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which was also Oscar-nominated.\n\nEleni Karaindrou has been an ECM recording artist since 1991, working closely with producer Manfred Eicher in the adapting of compositions originally written for stage and screen for album release.
