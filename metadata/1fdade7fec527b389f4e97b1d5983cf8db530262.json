Ginell (AMG)\nNow listeners enter the heart of the Paul Desmond/Jim Hall sessions, a great quartet date with Gene Cherico manning the bass (Gene Wright deputizes on the title track) and MJQ drummer Connie Kay displaying other sides of his personality. Everyone wanted Desmond to come up with a sequel to the monster hit &quot;Take Five&quot;; and so he did, reworking the tune and playfully designating the meter as 10/8. Hence &quot;Take Ten,&quot; a worthy sequel with a solo that has a Middle-Eastern feeling akin to Desmond&amp;#039;s famous extemporaneous excursion with Brubeck in &quot;Le Souk&quot; back in 1954. It was here that Desmond also unveiled a spin-off of the then-red-hot bossa nova groove that he called &quot;bossa antigua&quot; (a sardonic play-on-words meaning &quot;old thing&quot;), which laid the ground for Desmond&amp;#039;s next album and a few more later in the decade. Two of the best examples are his own tunes, the samba-like &quot;El Prince&quot; (named after arranger Bob Prince), an infectious number with on-the-wing solo flights that you can&amp;#039;t get out of your head, and the haunting &quot;Embarcadero.&quot; Hall now gets plenty of room to stretch out, supported by Kay&amp;#039;s gently dropped bombs, and he is the perfect understated swinging foil for the wistful altoist. There is not a single track here that isn&amp;#039;t loaded with ingeniously worked out, always melodic ideas. \n \n  01. Take Ten \n  02. Prince \n  03. Alone Together \n  04. Embarcadero \n  05.
