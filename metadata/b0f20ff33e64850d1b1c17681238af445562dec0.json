Along with some fascinating glimpses into universes that could have been, and new insight into a few key events of the past, Age of Ultron also treated readers to gorgeous artwork from artists such as Carlos Pacheco, Andre Araujo, Butch Guice, Adam Kubert, Bryan Hitch, Alex Maleev, and even Joe Quesada, as well as some excellent character-focused work from luminaries such as Kathryn Immonen, Matt Fraction, Rick Remender, Christos Gage, Al Ewing, Matt Kindt, Mark Waid and of course Brian Michael Bendis.
