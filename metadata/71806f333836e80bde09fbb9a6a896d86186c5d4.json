Cochard, PhD, Lori A Goodhartz, MD Carla B, Harmath, MD, Nancy M. Major MD, and Srinivasan Mukundan, JR, MD, makes interpreting normal and abnormal X-ray, CT, and MR images easy by correlating them with crystal-clear Netter illustrations. You'll learn to recognize anatomical relationships in images and apply them to a variety of examples of pathology throughout the body, including the imaging of masses, air, or blood in organs and spaces...fractures, thickening, constriction, and compression...and more. You can also access the book from any computer at studentconsult.com. It's an ideal introduction to diagnostic imaging!\n\nVisualize anatomical structures and relationships with perfect clarity with the aid of vivid, colorful Netter artwork. The coloring, texture, and idealized emphasis help you interpret relationships between structures and compartments as seen in cross section and in X-rays, CT, and MRI.\n\nDevelop your ability to better identify pathologies by viewing normal healthy anatomical images and abnormal images. Comparative images reinforce your basic understanding of what normal tissues and anatomy look like and serve as a guide in recognizing disease patterns and processes: atypically large or small organs and compartments, masses, air, or blood in organs and spaces, fractures, thickening, constriction, compression, and more.\n\nUnderstand the principles that underlie X-ray, CT, MR, ultrasound, and nuclear medicine imaging, the use of contrast and angiography.\n\nUnderstand how radiologists apply systematic search strategies in imaging studies of each region of the body.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71806f333836e80bde09fbb9a6a896d86186c5d4","amp;dn":"Netter%27s+Introduction+to+Imaging+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71806f333836e80bde09fbb9a6a896d86186c5d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,128,111,51,56,54,232,11,222,9,251,185,166,168,150,216,97,134,197,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
