In this beautifully photographed cookbook, Segan details the hottest, newest, and most unusual pasta dishes from ItalyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s food bloggers, home cooks, artisan pasta makers, and vanguard chefs. The 100 distinctive pasta recipes, including many vegan and vegetarian specialties, range from simple and elegant (Gemelli with Caramelized Oranges and Crispy Pancetta) to more complex (Neapolitan Carnevale Lasagna) to cutting-edge (Cappuccino Caper Pasta). Tips and anecdotes culled from SeganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Italian travels enhance the easy-to-follow directions, and a glossary of more than 50 extraordinary dried pastas showcases shapes to revive any pasta loverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s repertoire. For contemporary, authentic Italian pasta, Pasta Modern is the go-to guide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d545039a27ed216fffbac54c49e26bf0dd266df4","amp;dn":"Pasta+Modern+-+New+%26amp%3B+Inspired+Recipes+from+Italy+-+EPUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d545039a27ed216fffbac54c49e26bf0dd266df4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,69,3,154,39,237,33,111,255,186,197,76,73,226,107,240,221,38,109,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
