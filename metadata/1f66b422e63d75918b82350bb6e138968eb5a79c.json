In numerous and diverse operations the player is responsible for enforcing law and order on EuropeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fastest roads.\n\nIn addition to the 40 missions revolving around the daily duties of the Autobahn Police, one can enjoy the extensive Ã¢â‚¬Å“Free PlayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ mode. This mode generates random radio calls for operations which the player is free to accept. All in all, this mode includes 100 additional operations at various locations and times of day. Accidents can be more or less severe and can also include trucks. The fully equipped patrol car houses all material needed to secure and inspect the accident site. Emergency vehicles, fire trucks and rescue services complete the scene at the accident.\n\nAnother option available to the player is to use the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bitte folgenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Follow Me) sign of the patrol car to flag down suspicious cars. Drivers trying to escape have to be chased down and stopped.\nIn the course of an inspection, the driver has to be examined for alcohol abuse, possession of drugs and for the roadworthiness of his car.\n\nThe simulation covers a total Autobahn stretch of 40 kilometres (approx. 25 miles). Some sections have a speed limit where the player can perform speed checks out of an unmarked police car.\n\nRealistic radio communications create a real life and exciting atmosphere, further enhanced by the day and night mode with its emergency light operations.\n\nThe game offers a view from within the car as well as from an exterior camera view with a free movement. Using a steering wheel will make the simulation even more enjoyable.\nFeatures\n\nApproximately 40 km (25 mi.) of Autobahn\nTwo police vehicles Ã¢â‚¬â€œ patrol car and unmarked car\nMale and female game characters\nFlagging down suspicious vehicles\nChasing down fleeing suspects\nChecking for alcohol or drugs\nVerifying TÃƒÅ“V (MOT) inspection stickers\nInspecting truck loads and checking truck driver rest periods\nUsing the unmarked car for speed patrols, then following-up with stops and issuing tickets\nSmall and serious accidents including trucks\nSecuring accident sites\nResponding to accidents\nOn-site fire and rescue vehicles\nDay and night shifts\nRealistic radio communications\nSupport for gamepad and steering wheel \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s9.postimg.org/ncsk7ui5r/ss_3a456fd36b7a6ea164d4f13ed0e6f020f8f1cd07_1920.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s9.postimg.org/ncsk7ui5r/ss_3a456fd36b7a6ea164d4f13ed0e6f020f8f1cd07_1920.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s9.postimg.org/ree8r8zu7/ss_7d12218ca6e2511ba98fa332c7d11d4b9e5dee5f_1920.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s9.postimg.org/ree8r8zu7/ss_7d12218ca6e2511ba98fa332c7d11d4b9e5dee5f_1920.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s9.postimg.org/63gomzhpr/ss_28023a9e1e42550730a790d2786c71f6d72c6e46_1920.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s9.postimg.org/63gomzhpr/ss_28023a9e1e42550730a790d2786c71f6d72c6e46_1920.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s9.postimg.org/ift8bc19r/ss_b843a18dca19505ac24cc1b2794a5796a87a5919_1920.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s9.postimg.org/ift8bc19r/ss_b843a18dca19505ac24cc1b2794a5796a87a5919_1920.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s9.postimg.org/t7h5fkl0v/ss_e4dd8293ca6d20d62a0a487a419d09c22e1d2016_1920.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s9.postimg.org/t7h5fkl0v/ss_e4dd8293ca6d20d62a0a487a419d09c22e1d2016_1920.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f66b422e63d75918b82350bb6e138968eb5a79c","amp;dn":"Autobahn+Police+Simulator+GET%26amp%3BPLAY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f66b422e63d75918b82350bb6e138968eb5a79c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,102,180,34,230,61,117,145,139,130,53,11,182,225,56,150,142,181,167,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
