Within weeks it became the most hotly debated topic, with Dawkins himself branded as either saint or sinner for presenting his hard-hitting, impassioned rebuttal of religion of all types. His argument could hardly be more topical. While Europe is becoming increasingly secularized, the rise of religious fundamentalism, whether in the Middle East or Middle America, is dramatically and dangerously dividing opinion around the world. In America, and elsewhere, a vigorous dispute between 'intelligent design' and Darwinism is seriously undermining and restricting the teaching of science. In many countries religious dogma from medieval times still serves to abuse basic human rights such as women's and gay rights. And all from a belief in a God whose existence lacks evidence of any kind. Dawkins attacks God in all his forms. He eviscerates the major arguments for religion and demonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war, foments bigotry and abuses children. &quot;The God Delusion&quot; is a brilliantly argued, fascinating polemic that will be required reading for anyone interested in this most emotional and important subject.\n\nAbout the author\nRichard Dawkins is the Charles Simonyi Professor for the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University and a fellow of New College. The Selfish Gene catapulted Richard Dawkins to fame, and remains his most famous and widely read work. It was followed by a string of bestselling books: The Extended Phenotype, The Blind Watchmaker, River Out of Eden, Climbing Mount Improbable, Unweaving the Rainbow, The Ancestor's Tale and a collection of his shorter writings A Devil's Chaplain. Dawkins is a Fellow of both the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Literature. He is the recipient of numerous honours and awards, including the 1987 Royal Society of Literature Award, the 1990 Michael Faraday Award of the Royal Society, the 1997 International Cosmos Prize for Achievement in Human Science, the Kistler Prize in 2001, and the Shakespeare Prize in 2005.\n\n\n\n\n\nGod is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything\nby Christopher Hitchens\nread by Christopher Hitchens\n \n\n'Here is the point about myself and my co-thinkers. Our belief is not a belief. Our principles are not a faith. We do not hold our convictions dogmatically. We believe with certainty that an ethical life can be lived without religion. And we know for a fact that the corollary holds true - that religion has caused innumerable people not just to conduct themselves no beter than others, but to award themselves permission to behave in ways that would make a brothel-keeper or an ethnic cleanser raise an eyebrow.' From the introduction to God Is Not Great.\n\nIn the tradition of Bertrand Russell's Why I Am Not a Christian, Christopher Hitchens makes the ultimate case against religion. In a series of acute readings of the major religious texts, he demonstrates the ways in which religion is man-made, dangerously sexually repressive and distorts the very origins of the cosmos. With robust clarity, Hitchens frames the argument for a more secular life based on science and reason, in which hell is replaced by the Hubble Telescope's awesome view of the universe and Moses and the burning bush give way to the beauty and symmetry of the double helix.\n\nGod is Not Great marvels at the possibility of society without religion, arguing that the concept of an omniscient God has profoundly damaged humanity. Hitchens proposes instead that the world might be a great deal better off without `him'.\n\nAbout the author\nChristopher Hitchens is a contributing editor to Vanity Fair and Visiting Professor in Liberal Studies at the New School in New York. He was named as one of the world's 'Top 100 Public Intellecutals' by Foreign Policy and Prospect. His books include Love, Poverty &amp; War and Blood, Class &amp; Empire. His biography of Thomas Paine's Rights of Man was published by Atlantic Books in 2006.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:350d2dc334089623f4ffc89d1933cbb082ab1645","amp;dn":"The+God+Delusion+%2F+God+is+Not+Great+-+Richard+Dawkins+%2F+Hitchins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"350d2dc334089623f4ffc89d1933cbb082ab1645","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,13,45,195,52,8,150,35,244,255,200,157,25,51,203,176,130,171,22,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
