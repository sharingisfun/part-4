Featuring compact volumes of 50 to 125 pages, the series covers a range of content from professional to academic.\r\n\r\nTypical publications can be:\r\n\r\nA timely report of state-of-the art methods\r\nAn introduction to or a manual for the application of mathematical or computer techniques\r\nA bridge between new research results, as published in journal articles\r\nA snapshot of a hot or emerging topic\r\nAn in-depth case study\r\nA presentation of core concepts that students must understand in order to make independent contributions\r\nSpringerBriefs are characterized by fast, global electronic dissemination, standard publishing contracts, standardized manuscript preparation and formatting guidelines, and expedited production schedules.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, SpringerBriefs in Applied Sciences and Technology are devoted to the publication of fundamentals and applications within the different classical engineering disciplines as well as in interdisciplinary fields that recently emerged between these areas. On the other hand, as the boundary separating fundamental research and applied technology is more and more dissolving, this series is particularly open to trans-disciplinary topics between fundamental science and engineering.\r\n\r\nIndexed by EI-Compendex and Springerlink","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e94c44a1e2c57feed7be418f1ae5ae78aa6a494a","amp;dn":"SpringerBriefs+in+Applied+Sciences+and+Technology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e94c44a1e2c57feed7be418f1ae5ae78aa6a494a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,76,68,161,226,197,127,238,215,190,65,143,26,229,174,120,170,106,73,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
