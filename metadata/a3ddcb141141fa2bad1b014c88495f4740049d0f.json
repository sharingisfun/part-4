The king of the story seemed to be tailor-made for Mr. Brynner, who made it his signature role and returned with it to the musical theatre, again and again. \n\nAs captured in film, directed by Walter Lang, &quot;The King and I&quot; is quite a splendid showcase for Mr. Brynner. Since Ms. Lawrence was not chosen to repeat the role of Anna that she created on the stage, her substitute was Deborah Kerr, an immensely talented actress who was a delight in any of the films she graced with her talent and charm. As a spectacle, this movie is full of exotic colors of what Hollywood thought Siam would look like in the years where the story takes place. The film works as well because of the charismatic performance of Yul Brynner and the terrific chemistry he and Ms. Kerr projected in the film.\n\n\n\n..............FOR ALL OF U WHO TRIED D EARLIER TORRENT WITH D SAME NAME N DIDNT GET IT GOIN, HERES ANOTHER TORRENT UPLOADED WITH D RITE TRACKER INFO...........\n\nNJY.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3ddcb141141fa2bad1b014c88495f4740049d0f","amp;dn":"The+King+And+I+%5B1956+Classic+DVD+Rip%5D+Divx+%5BEng%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3ddcb141141fa2bad1b014c88495f4740049d0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,221,203,20,17,65,250,43,173,27,1,76,136,73,95,71,64,4,157,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
