Nola is attracted to the best in each of them, but refuses to commit to any of them, cherishing her personal freedom instead, while each man wants her for himself.\n\n\nEnjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:792c61e4967c6f0e9abeb4c20f6b2cd67d1bf4ce","amp;dn":"She%27s+Gotta+Have+It+%281986%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"792c61e4967c6f0e9abeb4c20f6b2cd67d1bf4ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,44,97,228,150,124,111,14,154,190,180,194,15,107,44,214,125,27,244,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
