My students read through the entire book and worked through all the exercises in several chapters. They found it very helpful and practical for getting the main idea of how to teach ESL writing, how to present and practice skills, how to organize instruction. Like most ESL textbooks, there are topics included in this one which aren't my first choice (why do we often give ESL students cheery topics like capital punishment, euthanasia, etc?), but overall I think the authors have done an excellent job of demystifying the writing process, both for teachers and students. The text deals with the writing process, rhetorical modes, and grammar. Very balanced.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70ee2813bed264673986d69a8d0c172088329e7d","amp;dn":"Ann+Hogue+-+Introduction+to+Academic+Writing.+Level+3+%5B2006%5D+%5BA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70ee2813bed264673986d69a8d0c172088329e7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,238,40,19,190,210,100,103,57,134,214,154,141,12,23,32,136,50,158,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
