Suffering \nfrom OCD, he has a habit of counting things, like the number of times \nhe brushes each tooth, and the number of steps it takes to get to the \nbus stop for his daily commute. Because of these issues, he is highly \ndependent upon his watch, to which he refers often but which he \notherwise does not consciously consider. Despite his nature, he hates \nhis job. One day while he is brushing his teeth, he hears the bodiless \nvoice of a British woman eloquently narrating what seems to be his story \nas he is acting it out. The story not only includes his actions, but what \nhis innermost thoughts and feelings are at the time. The voice comes and \ngoes over time, Harold not knowing the full story based on the missing \nparts. Not knowing what to do, he brushes the voice aside until the voice \nsays, little did he know... would result in his imminent death. Knowing \nthat he is not schizophrenic which is the medical diagnosis, Harold turns \nto literature professor, Jules Hilbert, who becomes Harold's sole conf\nidante in the matter. Hilbert agrees to help him through the literary \nside of the matter, solely because the voice used the literary convention \nof little did he know. Trying to go against the normal in his life partly \nbased on Hilbert's advice, Harold begins to court Ana Pascal, a baker who \nhe is auditing, who detests the very thought of him, but about who he \nnonetheless cannot stop thinking. In reality, the voice in question \nbelongs to famed novelist, chain smoking and nervous Karen Eiffel, who \nis under great pressure from her publisher as she has not written \nanything in ten years due to writer's block. Her books always end with \nthe lead character dying. Harold's story is slowly coming together, but \nshe has not yet worked out how he will die. Harold's fate seems to be \nin Karen's typing hands, as his story plays out exactly when she types \nit out. The primary questions then become if Hilbert and Harold can find \nout that it is Karen writing the story, if so if Harold can locate her, \nif so if Karen will believe his story, and if so if she will change her \nartistic vision to save Harold's life... or conversely if the fate \nbetween Karen's typewriter and Harold's life can somehow otherwise \nbe broken.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Will Ferrell.\n=&gt;-Emma Thompson.\n=&gt;-Dustin Hoffman.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Marc Forster.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Comedy : Drama : Fantasy.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2006.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.39 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 768 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 52mn.\n=&gt;-Stranger Than Fiction......: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/stranger_than_fiction/\n=&gt;-Stranger Than Fiction......: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/stranger-than-fiction/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 1.85:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1 280 x 688.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1650 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 185 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df664c65ff13f5337fe08112d921f801e37e27ec","amp;dn":"Stranger+Than+Fiction+-+Will+Ferrell+Comedy+2006+Eng+Sub+720p+%5BH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df664c65ff13f5337fe08112d921f801e37e27ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,102,76,101,255,19,245,51,127,224,129,18,217,33,248,1,227,126,39,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
