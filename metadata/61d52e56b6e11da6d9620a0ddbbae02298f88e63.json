All of the group's finest moments are in place and sequenced totally out of order. However, kicking things off nicely is the anthem that got the Irish boys rolling in the first place, &quot;Jump Around.&quot; It still sounds as timeless and energetic nearly a decade along, as does its follow-up, &quot;Shamrocks and Shenanigans.&quot; Everlast's solo career is also well documented with his two chart successes, &quot;What It's Like&quot; and &quot;Black Jesus,&quot; both making appearances early on in the release. But the most welcome surprise is the inclusion of the rap-metal prototype &quot;Just Another Victim,&quot; a collaboration between House of Pain and Helmet that was originally released on the Judgment Night soundtrack. While the compilation does lull at some points (due mainly to having the biggest hits first), it's a solid collection that is appealing and accessible to the most seasoned die-hard fan as well as the casual listener. ~ Rob Theakston, Rovi \n\n\n1.
