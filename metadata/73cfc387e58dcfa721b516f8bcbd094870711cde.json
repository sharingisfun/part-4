Traveling throughout America, protagonists Sam and Dean Winchester use their father's journal to help them carry on the family businessÃ¢â‚¬â€saving people and hunting supernatural creatures. The season begins with the brothers tracking down the demons released from Hell in the previous season finale. They become allies with a demon named Ruby, who claims to know a way to release Dean from his demonic pactÃ¢â‚¬â€he had sold his soul to a demon and was given a year to live in exchange for Sam's resurrectionÃ¢â‚¬â€and wants to protect them from the new demonic leader Lilith. As Dean's deadline approaches, their efforts are further hindered by Bela Talbot, a professional thief of occult items who is often at odds with the Winchesters.\n\nIn the United States the season aired on Thursdays at 9:00 pm ET on the CW television network. The CW ordered 22 episodes for the season, but interference from the 2007Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2008 Writers Guild of America strike ultimately limited the season to 16 episodes. Some storylines were thus postponed, which Kripke felt ultimately benefited the season by forcing the writers to focus on saving Dean. Despite its low ratingsÃ¢â‚¬â€it averaged only about 2.74 million American viewersÃ¢â‚¬â€the series received an early renewal for a fourth season. The third season received mixed reviews from critics and fans, while the introduction of Ruby and Bela garnered generally negative responses","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73cfc387e58dcfa721b516f8bcbd094870711cde","amp;dn":"Supernatural%3A+Season+3+%282007-2008%29+720p+BlurayRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73cfc387e58dcfa721b516f8bcbd094870711cde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,207,195,135,229,141,207,167,33,181,22,248,188,189,9,72,112,113,28,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
