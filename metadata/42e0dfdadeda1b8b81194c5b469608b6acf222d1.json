The band is currently composed of Jim Creeggan, Kevin Hearn, Ed Robertson, and Tyler Stewart. Barenaked Ladies formed in 1988 in Scarborough, Ontario, then a suburban city outside Toronto.[1] They are best known for their hit singles, &quot;One Week&quot;, &quot;The Old Apartment&quot;, &quot;Pinch Me&quot;, &quot;If I Had $1000000&quot;, and &quot;Brian Wilson&quot;;[1] they have won multiple Juno Awards and been nominated for Grammy Awards. They are also known for their light-hearted, comedic performance style. The band's trademarks at live shows are humorous banter between songs and improvised raps/songs, both of which are staples at virtually every concert.[2] Original keyboardist Andy Creeggan left the band in 1995, and founding member Steven Page departed in 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\nGordon 1992\n\n\nGordon is the debut album by Canadian band Barenaked Ladies. It was released through Sire Records on July 28, 1992. After The Yellow Tape was certified platinum in Canada, the group won a contest hosted by a local radio station. With the winnings, Barenaked Ladies was able to hire producer Michael Phillip Wojewoda and record the album at Le Studio, north of Montreal. Though most of the album was recorded without incident, difficulty with &quot;The King of Bedside Manor&quot; caused the band to record the track nakedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a tradition they would continue on other albums. Horn parts, guest vocalists, and nods to other bands including Rush allowed Barenaked Ladies to expand on the sound they had developed while touring. &quot;They had a real clarity about what they wanted [the album] to be... I just captured what it is they do,&quot; said Wojewoda.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Hello City&quot; (Steven Page, Ed Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22\n2.\t&quot;Enid&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:07\n3.\t&quot;Grade 9&quot; (Jim Creeggan, Andy Creeggan, Page, Robertson, Tyler Stewart) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:53\n4.\t&quot;Brian Wilson&quot; (Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:47\n5.\t&quot;Be My Yoko Ono&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:45\n6.\t&quot;Wrap Your Arms Around Me&quot; (Creeggan, Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35\n7.\t&quot;What a Good Boy&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52\n8.\t&quot;The King of Bedside Manor&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:24\n9.\t&quot;Box Set&quot; (Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:48\n10.\t&quot;I Love You&quot; (Creeggan, Creeggan, Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n11.\t&quot;New Kid (On the Block)&quot; (Scott Dibble, Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:12\n12.\t&quot;Blame It on Me&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n13.\t&quot;The Flag&quot; (Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53\n14.\t&quot;If I Had $1000000&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27\n15.\t&quot;Crazy&quot; (Robertson, Wilson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe You Should Drive 1994\n\n\nMaybe You Should Drive (commonly abbreviated MYSD) was the second full-length album by Barenaked Ladies. It was released in August 1994 and has gone double platinum in Canada, reaching #3 upon its release. It was also their first album to chart in the US, peaking at #175 on the Billboard 200. Unlike on their previous album, Gordon, Steven Page and Ed Robertson did not write together very much for MYSD.[1]\n\nThe well-known tracks from this album include &quot;Jane&quot;, &quot;Alternative Girlfriend&quot;, &quot;These Apples&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, and &quot;Life, in a Nutshell.&quot; As with each of their early albums, the band recorded one song, &quot;Intermittently&quot;, completely naked. Fourteen tracks were brought to the recording session.[1] Tracks cut from the album include &quot;Break Your Heart&quot; and &quot;Trust Me&quot;, both of which were later re-recorded for Born on a Pirate Ship; the former was re-worked and appeared on that album, while the later was cut again, and appeared as a B-side on the Shoe Box EP.\n\nOf the recording session, Steven Page said &quot;We did most of [recording Maybe You Should Drive] in Burnaby, a cold and industrial wasteland, with a huge budget we really didn't need [...] All a huge budget does is put you further in debt. Imagine if they raised your VISA limit to $5,000 and then you had to give your card to a professional shopper-let's call him a producer in the case-and he said, 'OK, let's spend the whole thing.'&quot;[1] Also according to Page, keyboardist/percussionist Andy Creeggan considered leaving the band during the rehearsals for this album, but was convinced to stay for its completion, and touring.[1] He then left the band and entered McGill University's music program. He has since recorded four albums with his brother Jim (who is also bassist for Barenaked Ladies) under the name The Brothers Creeggan.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Jane&quot; (Duffy, Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04\n2.\t&quot;Intermittently&quot; (Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:05\n3.\t&quot;These Apples&quot; (Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10\n4.\t&quot;You Will Be Waiting&quot; (Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n5.\t&quot;A&quot; (Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20\n6.\t&quot;Everything Old Is New Again&quot; (Duffy, Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:13\n7.\t&quot;Alternative Girlfriend&quot; (Duffy, Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:23\n8.\t&quot;Am I the Only One?&quot; (Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:49\n9.\t&quot;Little Tiny Song&quot; (Creeggan) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:02\n10.\t&quot;Life, in a Nutshell&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:14\n11.\t&quot;The Wrong Man Was Convicted&quot; (Duffy, Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:06\n12.\t&quot;Great Provider&quot; (Creeggan, Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBorn on a Pirate Ship 1996\n\n\nBorn on a Pirate Ship (sometimes abbreviated BOAPS[1]) is the third full-length album by Barenaked Ladies. Its well-known tracks are &quot;Shoe Box&quot;, &quot;The Old Apartment&quot;, &quot;When I Fall&quot; and &quot;Break Your Heart.&quot; &quot;The Old Apartment&quot; would become BNL's first US hit in 1997 and began the process of winning many new American fans.\n\nThis was the first album recorded following the departure of keyboardist Andy Creeggan, who had considered leaving before the recording of their previous album, Maybe You Should Drive.[2] BOAPS was recorded as a four-piece. Kevin Hearn is not credited on the album, but joined the group for the 1995 tour that preceded the album's release in time to be thanked in the liner notes for &quot;injecting new spirit.&quot;\n\nSteven Page and Ed Robertson returned to writing together, as they did upon the band's formation, but had abandoned following the release of Gordon, [2] Tracks recorded for this album but left off the finished record are: &quot;Trust Me&quot; (earlier recorded for Maybe You Should Drive but left off the album -- included on the Shoe Box EP) and &quot;Back&quot; (included on the &quot;Brian Wilson 2000&quot; single). As with each of their early albums, the band recorded one song completely naked. On this album, &quot;Back&quot; was the &quot;naked track&quot;.\n\nThe front cover features a boy in a newspaper hat pulling at his cheeks, in reference to the childhood prank alluded to by the album's title. Contrary to popular belief, this is not a childhood picture of BNL bassist Jim Creeggan, but simply an actor hired for the photos.\n\nThe album is also an enhanced CD. The data track contains audio samples from the band's previous two CDs, a short montage of press photos, several of the band's music videos, a short trivia quiz, and a pair of &quot;behind the scenes&quot; videos from the band. Similar content was included and expanded upon on the Shoe Box E.P., however, the format of the enhanced CD used in the creation of that CD renders the data track inaccessible on modern operating systems.\n\nAlthough a moderate #18 hit in Canada, the album only managed #111 in the US. Born On A Pirate Ship was awarded gold status in the U.S. in 2000, after the band became more popular there.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Stomach vs. Heart&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:29\n2.\t&quot;Straw Hat and Old Dirty Hank&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23\n3.\t&quot;I Know&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:02 \no\tincludes a sample of televangelist Robert Tilton saying &quot;and you have faith! You just need to use it, saith the Lord.&quot;\n4.\t&quot;This Is Where It Ends&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:53\n5.\t&quot;When I Fall&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04\n6.\t&quot;I Live with It Every Day&quot; (Duffy, Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30\n7.\t&quot;The Old Apartment&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:29\n8.\t&quot;Call Me Calmly&quot; (Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:52\n9.\t&quot;Break Your Heart&quot; (Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:57\n10.\t&quot;Spider in My Room&quot; (Creeggan) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03\n11.\t&quot;Same Thing&quot; (Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01\n12.\t&quot;Just a Toy&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42\n13.\t&quot;In the Drink&quot; (Creeggan) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:12\n14.\t&quot;Shoe Box&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRock Spectacle 1996\n\n\nRock Spectacle (1996) is the fourth full-length album by Barenaked Ladies and their first live release. This was the album that finally broke the American market for BNL, with the live version of &quot;Brian Wilson&quot; and a release of &quot;The Old Apartment&quot; from Born on a Pirate Ship featuring this live version becoming hits, and Rock Spectacle selling over a million copies there alone. The record was recorded at two concerts at the Riviera Theatre in Chicago and at The Olympia in Montreal during the Born on a Pirate Ship tour.\n\nA live version of &quot;Shoe Box&quot; was on promotional and advance copies of this record, but was left off at the last second. This particular recording of &quot;Shoe Box&quot; appears on the &quot;One Week&quot; CD single. At the very end of the &quot;$1000000&quot; track, there are two bonus tracks. One is a banter about an elderly woman Ed ran into in Chicago. Part of this story is referenced in the &quot;$1000000&quot; song, which must have originally occurred after this banter at the Chicago concert. The second is an improvised song/rap about Ed Robertson's (the band's vocalist/guitarist) Uncle Elwyn. There is some question as to whether this &quot;Uncle Elwyn&quot; is a real person.\n\nThis disc is an enhanced CD, which means it will display special multimedia features when played on a computer. It includes a program called &quot;BNLTV&quot;, a faux collection of various-themed TV programming.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Brian Wilson&quot; (Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:46\n2.\t&quot;Straw Hat and Old Dirty Hank&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n3.\t&quot;Break Your Heart&quot; (Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:06\n4.\t&quot;Jane&quot; (Duffy, Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58\n5.\t&quot;When I Fall&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:23\n6.\t&quot;Hello City&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:13\n7.\t&quot;What a Good Boy&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:47\n8.\t&quot;The Old Apartment&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21\n9.\t&quot;Life, in a Nutshell&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:40\n10.\t&quot;These Apples&quot; (Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59\n11.\t&quot;Grade 9/If I Had $1000000&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 11:48\n\n*  Contains a hidden track with some anecdotes and a song &quot;Uncle Elwyn&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStunt 1998\n\n\n\nStunt is the fourth full-length studio album by Barenaked Ladies. By far their most successful album, it entered the US charts at #3 and sold over 4 million units by the end of its chart run. Its first single, &quot;One Week&quot;, became (and remains) the band's biggest hit, hitting #1 in the US (selling over 5 million copies) and #5 in the UK. The twin successes of Stunt and &quot;One Week&quot; also helped revitalize their career in their home country of Canada, where their fame had diminished since the days of their debut album Gordon. In addition, follow-up singles &quot;It's All Been Done&quot;, &quot;Alcohol&quot; and &quot;Call and Answer&quot; were each successful to some degree.\n\nStunt is the first studio album to feature keyboardist/guitarist Kevin Hearn, who originally joined the band for the Born on a Pirate Ship tour in 1995. Shortly after the release of this album, Kevin Hearn was diagnosed with leukemia. He spent the Stunt tour in the hospital. He was temporarily replaced by Chris Brown and Greg Kurstin.\n\nTracks recorded for Stunt but left off the finished record are &quot;Long Way Back Home&quot; and &quot;She's On Time.&quot; These tracks appear as hidden tracks on the &quot;limited edition&quot; version of the album. As with each of their early albums, the band recorded one song, &quot;Alcohol&quot;, completely naked.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;One Week&quot; (Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:52\n2.\t&quot;It's All Been Done&quot; (Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26\n3.\t&quot;Light up My Room&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36\n4.\t&quot;I'll Be That Girl&quot; (Duffy, Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34\n5.\t&quot;Leave&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24\n6.\t&quot;Alcohol&quot; (Duffy, Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43\n7.\t&quot;Call and Answer&quot; (Duffy, Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:49\n8.\t&quot;In the Car&quot; (Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53\n9.\t&quot;Never Is Enough&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23\n10.\t&quot;Who Needs Sleep?&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44\n11.\t&quot;Told You So&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:21\n12.\t&quot;Some Fantastic (Ivory &amp; Ivory)&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n13.\t&quot;When You Dream&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaroon 2000\n\n\nMaroon (2000) is the fifth full-length studio album by Barenaked Ladies. The follow-up to 1998's Stunt, Maroon reached #1 Canada [1](their second to do so after 1992's Gordon) and #5 in the United States, selling a million units in America alone. With keyboardist Kevin Hearn's leukemia battle won, and with an instinct to downplay the jokey reputation they were so known for, BNL deliberately created a more serious and sophisticated album. The album spawned three successful singles which still receive moderate airplay: &quot;Pinch Me&quot;, &quot;Too Little Too Late&quot; and &quot;Falling for the First Time.&quot;\n\nUnlike past albums, the songs came almost entirely from the pairing of Page/Robertson. One track, &quot;Baby Seat&quot;, was written by Page with his longtime song-writing partner, Stephen Duffy. This was the last Page/Duffy track that Barenaked Ladies would release, starting a policy of keeping the writing within the band on their next album. &quot;Hidden Sun&quot;, written while Hearn was in the hospital, appears as a hidden track on most copies of the album[citation needed]. As with each of their early albums, the band recorded one song, &quot;Humour of the Situation&quot;, completely naked.\n\nThe band recorded 17 tracks for the album;[2] Tracks recorded for this album but omitted from the finished record include: &quot;Powder Blue&quot; (appears on the US &quot;Pinch Me&quot; single), &quot;Inline Bowline&quot; (appears as an extra track on some international versions, and is on the Australian &quot;Pinch Me&quot; single), &quot;Born Human&quot; (appears on the Australian &quot;Pinch Me&quot; single, re-recorded for Hearn's album Night Light) and &quot;Half a Heart&quot; (re-recorded for the Barenaked Ladies Are Me sessions). &quot;That's All, That's All&quot; was also written for the album, and was later recorded for Page's The Vanity Project.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Too Little Too Late&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24\n2.\t&quot;Never Do Anything&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51\n3.\t&quot;Pinch Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:45\n4.\t&quot;Go Home&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:43\n5.\t&quot;Falling for the First Time&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40\n6.\t&quot;Conventioneers&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43\n7.\t&quot;Sell Sell Sell&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01\n8.\t&quot;The Humour of the Situation&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n9.\t&quot;Baby Seat&quot; (Stephen Duffy, Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:13\n10.\t&quot;Off the Hook&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34\n11.\t&quot;Helicopters&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:33\n12.\t&quot;Tonight Is the Night I Fell Asleep at the Wheel&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:51 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisc One: All Their Greatest Hits 2001\n\n\nDisc One: All Their Greatest Hits (1991ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2001) is a greatest hits compilation spanning Barenaked Ladies' first decade as a band; It contains a version of almost every single they had released to that point, along with two newly recorded tracks: &quot;It's Only Me (The Wizard of Magicland)&quot; and &quot;Thanks That Was Fun&quot;, the latter of which was released as a single. Disc One was released in November 2001 to a warm commercial reaction (being certified gold in the United States). The title itself is a tongue-in-cheek reference to a line from the band's song &quot;Box Set&quot; off the album Gordon, which is about a box set release from a has-been band: &quot;Disc One - it's where we've begun/It's all my greatest hits/And if you are a fan then you know that you've already got 'em.&quot; The album was released two months after the September 11 terror attacks, and is dedicated to the victims.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;The Old Apartment&quot; (Steven Page, Ed Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22 (new edit of radio mix)\n2.\t&quot;Falling For The First Time&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:39\n3.\t&quot;Brian Wilson&quot; (Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:44 (Rock Spectacle live version)\n4.\t&quot;One Week&quot; (Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:48\n5.\t&quot;Be My Yoko Ono&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:44\n6.\t&quot;Alternative Girlfriend&quot; (Stephen Duffy, Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20\n7.\t&quot;It's Only Me (The Wizard of Magicland)&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:34\n8.\t&quot;If I Had $1000000&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25\n9.\t&quot;Call and Answer&quot; (Duffy, Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:48\n10.\t&quot;Get in Line&quot; (Jim Creeggan, Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:39\n11.\t&quot;It's All Been Done&quot; (Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26\n12.\t&quot;Jane&quot; (Duffy, Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04\n13.\t&quot;Lovers in a Dangerous Time&quot; (Bruce Cockburn) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05\n14.\t&quot;Pinch Me&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37 (radio edit without fadeout ending)\n15.\t&quot;Shoe Box&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:09 (radio remix)\n16.\t&quot;What a Good Boy&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:50 (Rock Spectacle live version)\n17.\t&quot;Too Little Too Late&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23\n18.\t&quot;Enid&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:07\n19.\t&quot;Thanks That Was Fun&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEverything to Everyone 2003\n\n\nEverything to Everyone (commonly abbreviated E2E) is the sixth full-length original-material studio album by Barenaked Ladies. It was released in 2003 and was produced by Ron Aniello. Singles from the album include &quot;Another Postcard&quot;, &quot;Testing 1, 2, 3&quot;, &quot;For You&quot;, &quot;Celebrity&quot; and &quot;Maybe Katie&quot;. The content of the album is noted for its increased political commentary over previous albums.\n\n\nThe album was the first under the band's new policy of keeping the writing exclusively within the band. This resulted in increased contribution from Jim Creeggan and Kevin Hearn, and the band ended up recording more songs than usual (which in turn resulted in a 14 song album plus a bonus track). The album was recorded in Los Angeles, and was the first album the band recorded following the inception of their online blog. This allowed the band to communicate with their fans on a continual basis during the recording, and gave additional insight into the creative process.\n\nThe band took to the facility's B-studio near the end of the recording to record versions of the album's songs on acoustic instruments. This was quickly setup, and drummer Tyler Stewart ended up using a drum kit assembled from various unusual objects. The band performed eleven songs which comprised the entire released album except for &quot;Shopping&quot;, &quot;Unfinished&quot;, &quot;War on Drugs&quot; and the bonus track &quot;Yes!, Yes!!, Yes!!!&quot;. This acoustic session proved successful, and a similar performance would be undertaken for their next album, Barenaked Ladies Are Me (BLAM).\n\nThe album's cover was painted by Canadian Chris Woods, and depicts the band in profile displaying a white flag of surrender. The title text was displayed over the flag, though to preserve the meaning of the white flag, the album title was not printed on the cover itself. It was instead placed as a sticker on the transparent wrapping, and was &quot;flat&quot;, not wavy to match the flag's contours. For the special edition, the title was on the clear plastic sleeve, and matched the flag's waves. The original painting, a 60&quot;x60&quot; oil on canvas, reportedly hangs at Page's farmhouse studio, Fresh Baked Woods.\n\nTracks recorded but not included on the album:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\t&quot;Statue of Los Angeles&quot; (unreleased) - a Hearn song; released on his album The Miracle Mile\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\t&quot;Sign Me Up&quot; (unreleased) - described as &quot;basically us swearing our heads off for six minutes&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\t&quot;Adrift&quot; (re-recorded for BLAM)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\t&quot;What a Let Down&quot; (re-recorded for BLAM)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\t&quot;I Can, I Will, I Do&quot; (previously recorded on Disc One, and re-recorded for BLAM; appears on iTunes Originals - Barenaked Ladies).\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\t&quot;Yes! Yes!! Yes!!!&quot; (bonus track on the special edition's DVD, and b-side on the UK single for &quot;Celebrity&quot;)\n\nAs with each of their early albums, the band recorded one song, &quot;Sign Me Up&quot;, completely naked.\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Celebrity&quot; (Hearn, Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27\n2.\t&quot;Maybe Katie&quot; (Creeggan, Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:58\n3.\t&quot;Another Postcard&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n4.\t&quot;Next Time&quot; (Creeggan, Hearn, Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51\n5.\t&quot;For You&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27\n6.\t&quot;Shopping&quot; (Hearn, Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34\n7.\t&quot;Testing 1,2,3&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32\n8.\t&quot;Upside Down&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:15\n9.\t&quot;War on Drugs&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:32\n10.\t&quot;Aluminum&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34\n11.\t&quot;Unfinished&quot; (Hearn, Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00\n12.\t&quot;Second Best&quot; (Hearn, Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21\n13.\t&quot;Take It Outside&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n14.\t&quot;Have You Seen My Love?&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:55\n15.\t&quot;Another Postcard&quot; [acoustic] ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35 (bonus track on Limited Edition release)\n16.\t&quot;Maybe Katie&quot; [acoustic] ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:09 (bonus track on Limited Edition release)\n17.\t&quot;Second Best&quot; [acoustic] ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:31 (bonus track on Limited Edition release)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarenaked for the Holidays 2004\n\n\nBarenaked for the Holidays is a full-length holiday-themed album released by Canadian band Barenaked Ladies on October 5, 2004. The album includes Christmas and Hanukkah songs as well as &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;, which is traditionally sung on New Year's Eve. There are also several songs that are simply about the winter season. The album was the first album recorded at Steven Page's studio, Fresh Baked Woods and was the first released independently by BNL's Desperation Records label (and distributed by the Warner Music Group). It was the band's first studio album for which a &quot;naked track&quot; was not recorded. Page later admitted that the album was not his idea it was not what he wanted to do.[1]\n\nWhile the album contains some faithful interpretations of traditional songs, much of the album plays true to Ladies' off-kilter spirit. &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; begins as a slow, faithful rendition before breaking into an up-tempo version, including the &quot;Batman smells...&quot; lyric variation, and Page breaking down laughing. Several existing songs are included in the form of keyboard interludes; &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot; is included as a hidden track in the form &quot;Happy Birthday Jesus&quot;. The song &quot;Deck The Stills&quot; is an adaptation or parody of the song &quot;Deck The Halls&quot; with the lyrics Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young repeated in place of the real lyrics (it was an in-joke with the band at the time to use these lyrics in other songs). The album also includes the Band Aid charity song, &quot;Do They Know It's Christmas?&quot;, all the royalties from which the band donates to the Stephen Lewis Foundation. Finally, the album includes seven songs written by the band, including some they'd performed for years, and others written for this album.\n\nThe album was a popular release during the Christmas season of 2004, and reached #64 in the regular Billboard album charts.\n\nThere were two &quot;sub-releases&quot; of this album. The first was an E.P. available as a digital download, released November 15, 2005. It contained a live version of &quot;Hanukkah, O Hanukkah&quot; from their Toronto concert on November 20, 2004, as well as the album versions of &quot;Hanukkah Blessings&quot; and &quot;I Have a Little Dreidel&quot;.\n\nThe second release was called Barenaked on a Stick, and was 128MB USB flash drive that contained the Holidays CD, live songs and ad libs, a demo recording, videos of the album recording, promo photos and buddy icons for instant messaging programs. It was sold initially at the 2005 holiday concert tour, and then through Nettwerk's online store, and though Amazon.com.\n\nThe song &quot;Hanukkah Blessings&quot; was released on the Rock Band music store on December 23, 2008.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Jingle Bells&quot; (Traditional) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:57\n2.\t&quot;Green Christmas&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:34 - Re-recorded; originally from the 2000 soundtrack for How the Grinch Stole Christmas\n3.\t&quot;I Saw Three Ships&quot; (Traditional) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:07\n4.\t&quot;Hanukkah Blessings&quot; (Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27\n5.\t&quot;O Holy Night&quot; (Traditional) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:09\n6.\t&quot;Elf's Lament&quot; (Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:38 - featuring Michael BublÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©\n7.\t&quot;Snowman&quot; (Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:59\n8.\t&quot;Do They Know It's Christmas?&quot; (Bob Geldof, Midge Ure) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32 - Previously released in a live version\n9.\t&quot;Hanukkah, Oh Hanukkah&quot; (Traditional) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:11\n10.\t&quot;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen/We Three Kings&quot; (Traditional) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26 - featuring Sarah McLachlan, recorded in 1997\n11.\t&quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; (Johnny Marks) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:59\n12.\t&quot;Carol of the Bells&quot; (Leontovych, Wilhousky) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00\n13.\t&quot;Footprints&quot; (Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:14\n14.\t&quot;Deck the Stills&quot; (Traditional) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:32\n15.\t&quot;Christmastime (Oh Yeah)&quot; (Hearn) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:16 - Re-recorded; originally with Page on vocals for a compilation album.\n16.\t&quot;Sleigh Ride&quot; (Anderson, Parish) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:46\n17.\t&quot;Christmas Pics&quot; (Creeggan) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:13\n18.\t&quot;I Have a Little Dreidel&quot; (Goldfarb, Grossman) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:52\n19.\t&quot;Wonderful Christmas Time&quot; (Paul McCartney) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:18 \no\t&quot;Happy Birthday To You&quot; (hidden track)\n20.\t&quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; (Traditional) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre Me 2006\n\n\nBarenaked Ladies Are Me (usually abbreviated BLAM, and occasionally Are Me or BLAMe) is the seventh full-length original-material studio album by Barenaked Ladies. It was their first original-material album since 2003's Everything to Everyone. It was released in September 2006 internationally. The album was also the first full-length original-material album from the band following their decision not to re-sign with Reprise and become independent. The cover art was created by a group of artists called Team Macho. The name has been cited by the band[citation needed] as a double entendre for &quot;Barenaked Ladies Army&quot;.\n\nDue to the diversity and wealth of content recorded for the album, the release of the material from the Are Me sessions became more complicated than for prior albums. The band recorded 29 songs during the sessions: The primary physical release of Barenaked Ladies Are Me is a 13-track CD. Five months after the release of Are Me, a second primary physical album, Barenaked Ladies Are Men, was released, and included the remaining 16 songs from the same sessions. However, the line between these two releases was blurred by a series of additional releases which included songs from both releases in a variety of groupings. Thus, the entire 29-song collection could be considered the band's seventh full-length original-material studio album in its own right, or as both its seventh and eighth, taking Are Me and Are Men separately.\n\n\nTracks: \n\nAdrift\nBank Job\nSound of Your Voice\nEasy\nHome\nBull in a China Shop\nEverything Had Changed\nPeterborough and the Kawarthas\nMaybe YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re Right\nTake it Back\nVanishing\nRule The World With Love\nWind It Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre Men 2007\n\n\nBarenaked Ladies Are Men (sometimes abbreviated BLAMen or Are Men) is the eighth full-length original-material studio album by Barenaked Ladies, and the second release of material from the 29-song session that bore the companion album Barenaked Ladies Are Me. The two albums (or at least their material) were released together under the Are Me title in several &quot;deluxe&quot; release methods before Are Men received its own proper official release in February 2007. In this way, Are Me and Are Men together may be considered the band's seventh full-length original-material studio album. The album's artwork was created by Team Macho who also did similar artwork for the Are Me releases. The title is an extension of the Are Me title. During touring for the two albums, a pre-show video showed an unidentified hand adding various other extensions to the Barenaked Ladies Are Me title.\n\nThe formal release of the album is an Enhanced CD, and contains software and individual tracks that allow the owner to remix three of the band's songs. An advanced release of the album, exclusive to Canadian Starbucks, was released on October 3, 2006. This version lacked the Enhanced CD feature, as well as final four tracks, which at the time were deemed &quot;bonus tracks&quot; for the Are Me release, both in it's single-album form, and its 25-track deluxe form. The Starbucks version, however, included the two singles at the time from Are Me.\n\nUpon its release, Barenaked Ladies Are Men reached #102 in the US and #39 in the band's native Canada.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Serendipity&quot; (Hearn) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:11\n2.\t&quot;Something You'll Never Find&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:57\n3.\t&quot;One and Only&quot; (Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n4.\t&quot;Angry People&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01\n5.\t&quot;Down To Earth&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:46\n6.\t&quot;Beautiful&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:35\n7.\t&quot;Running Out Of Ink&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58\n8.\t&quot;Half a Heart&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27\n9.\t&quot;Maybe Not&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00\n10.\t&quot;I Can I Will I Do&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:08\n11.\t&quot;Fun &amp; Games&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n12.\t&quot;The New Sad&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:34\n13.\t&quot;Quality&quot; (Page, Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15\n14.\t&quot;Another Spin&quot; (Hearn) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05\n15.\t&quot;What A Letdown&quot; (Robertson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n16.\t&quot;Why Say Anything Nice?&quot; (Page, Robertson, Stewart) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnacktime 2008\n\n\nSnacktime! is a children's album release from Canadian band Barenaked Ladies released on May 6, 2008.[1] A companion book was written with artwork by multi-instrumentalist Kevin Hearn, who also contributed artwork for the album. It is the final Barenaked Ladies album to include Steven Page, who departed the band on February 25, 2009. He was subsequently quoted, saying of the album, &quot;[i]t was a lot of fun to do, but it wasn't my idea. I was along for the ride.&quot;[2]\n\nSnacktime! reached #10 on Canadian charts and peaked at #61 on the Billboard 200. It also won a Juno Award in 2008 in the Best Children's Album category.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;7 8 9&quot;\n2.\t&quot;The Ninjas&quot;\n3.\t&quot;Pollywog In A Bog&quot;\n4.\t&quot;Raisins&quot;\n5.\t&quot;Eraser&quot;\n6.\t&quot;I Can Sing&quot;\n7.\t&quot;Louis Loon&quot;\n8.\t&quot;Food Party&quot;\n9.\t&quot;Canadian Snacktime Trilogy: Snacktime&quot;\n10.\t&quot;Canadian Snacktime Trilogy: Popcorn&quot;\n11.\t&quot;Canadian Snacktime Trilogy: Vegetable Town&quot;\n12.\t&quot;Drawing&quot;\n13.\t&quot;Humungous Tree&quot;\n14.\t&quot;My Big Sister&quot;\n15.\t&quot;Allergies&quot;\n16.\t&quot;I Don't Like&quot;\n17.\t&quot;What a Wild Tune&quot;\n18.\t&quot;Bad Day&quot;\n19.\t&quot;Things&quot;\n20.\t&quot;Curious&quot;\n21.\t&quot;A Word for That&quot;\n22.\t&quot;Wishing&quot;\n23.\t&quot;Crazy ABC's&quot;\n24.\t&quot;Here Come The Geese&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll In Good Time 2010\n\n\nAll In Good Time is the ninth full-length original-material studio album by Barenaked Ladies (the eighth, if Barenaked Ladies Are Me and Are Men are considered as one double-album). All In Good Time was released on March 23, 2010 in Canada,[2] and March 30, 2010 in the United States.[1][3][4]. It is the first album recorded following the departure of founding member Steven Page in February 2009, and the band's second album recorded as a four-piece (their 1996 album Born on a Pirate Ship was recorded between the departure of original keyboardist Andy Creeggan and his replacement by Kevin Hearn). &quot;You Run Away&quot; was the first single released from the album.[3] &quot;Every Subway Car&quot; was released on US and Canadian iTunes on February 23 both as a preview track if the album is pre-ordered, and as a stand-alone purchase. It is also the upcoming second single from the album, however the single version has been recut as a duet with Erin McCarley.[5][6][7]\n\nThe band came to the table with 27 written songs, with 18 making the cut to be recorded. With Page's departure, Hearn and bassist Jim Creeggan have filled the void by contributing a comparatively greater share of lead vocals than on previous albums.[8] Ed Robertson, who had contributed lead vocals approximately equally with Page, sings lead on 10 of the 18 recorded songs, while Hearn and Creeggan sing on five and three respectively.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;You Run Away&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Summertime&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Another Heartbreak&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Four Seconds&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;On The Lookout&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Ordinary&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;I Have Learned&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Every Subway Car&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Jerome&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;How Long&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Golden Boy&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;I Saw It&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;The Love We're In&quot;  \n14.\t&quot;Watching The Northern Lights&quot;  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStephen Page ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Vanity Project 2005\n\n\nThe Vanity Project is an album released as a side-project by Steven Page, then of the band Barenaked Ladies. It is also the artist name under which the album was released. Its first two singles, &quot;That's All, That's All&quot; (in the U.S.) and &quot;Wilted Rose&quot; (in Canada), were released in early May 2005; only the latter song had a music video, which was animated.\n\nThe album features songs written mostly with longtime collaborator Stephen Duffy (one track - &quot;So. Cal&quot; - was written solo). Some of the songs are older holdovers (&quot;That's All, That's All&quot; was a song cut from Maroon). Other songs were written later specifically for the project. The album was released on June 21, 2005.\n\nThe lead vocals on the album were all provided by Page. Page also provided much of the album's instrumentation both through playing of instruments, and through programming computer-generated instruments. Duffy also played instruments on the record, as did several other guest performers.\n\nSteven Page began collaborating with songwriter Stephen Duffy in the early 1990s, and their first co-written tracks appeared on the Barenaked Ladies' second release, Maybe You Should Drive. The two co-wrote a number of songs over the years, including several on each of the band's next two albums. On their fifth album Maroon, only one Duffy co-write was included (at least two others were cut). Starting with the following album, the band decided that it would be best to keep the writing duties amongst the band members. Page started The Vanity Project to allow himself to write with other writers outside of Barenaked Ladies, as well as to express some writing ideas that did not work within the band.\n\nPage continued writing with Duffy and directed those songs, as well as song unused prior songs to his solo effort. The project's name resulted from a tape made for the project which was jokingly labeled &quot;Vanity Project&quot;. The title was subsequently adopted seriously for the project. Page indicated, at the time of its release, a potential for subsequent albums in collaboration with other writers and artists, but as of his 2009 departure from Barenaked Ladies, there had been no indication of any work on a follow-up.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Hit &amp; Run&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:10\n2.\t&quot;Wilted Rose&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:40\n3.\t&quot;These Wasted Words&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:11\n4.\t&quot;So.
