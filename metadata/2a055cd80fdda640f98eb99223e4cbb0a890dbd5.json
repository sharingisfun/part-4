But this CD was crisp and clean no caffeine so what the heck.\n\n- Big Papi[/i]\n\n[quote=&quot;By Lynn D. Larrow&quot;]\nIf you are looking for a good introduction or if you really can't decide on which Dexter Gordon album to buy, (it really is a difficult decision), you might just pick this guy up. It has some of Dexter's best recordings.\n\nDonald Byrd's (trumpet) Tanya has got to be one of the best Jazz songs ever recorded. Period. This recording sends shivers done my spine. Dexter reaches the &quot;other side&quot; on this one. You might recall it from episode 10 of Ken Burns' Jazz.\nI really like the happy Latin sound of Soy Califa. It is a great tune with Sonny Clark shinning brightly on piano while Billy Higgins is phenomenal on drums and Butch Warren plays a tight bass making for one splendid recording.\n\nOther standouts on this CD are Cheese Cake (same personnel as Soy Califa) from Dexter's acclaimed Go! album and Society Red, which was made famous in the movie Round Midnight. There really are no bad cuts on this CD. Great background music for every occasion.[/quote]\n\n\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/08/15/Folder09759.md.jpg[/img]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Dexter Gordon - The Best of Dexter Gordon: The Blue Note Years\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Dexter Gordon\nAlbum................: The Best of Dexter Gordon: The Blue Note Years\nGenre................: Jazz\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1988 11 02\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 65 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
