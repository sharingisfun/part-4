An excellent data source on cooling performance, such as building loads or solar thermal chiller efficiencies, it is essential reading for building services and renewable energy engineers and researchers covering sustainable design.\n\nThe book is unique in including a large set of experimental results from years of monitoring actual building and energy plants, as well as detailed laboratory and simulation analysis. These demonstrate which systems really work in buildings, what the real costs are and how operation can be optimized ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ crucial information for planners, builders and architects to gain confidence in applying new technologies in the building sector.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c06353a100326e0616daad041c8dc9aff2d4358c","amp;dn":"Low+Energy+Cooling+for+Sustainable+Buildings+2009+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c06353a100326e0616daad041c8dc9aff2d4358c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,99,83,161,0,50,110,6,22,218,173,4,28,141,201,175,242,212,53,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
