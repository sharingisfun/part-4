They were guitar rock traditionalists in the time when Radiohead and their happy followers Coldplay ruled British rock, marching just outside of the Zeitgeist but appealing to thousands anyway, probably because they never tried to compete with Radiohead's spacy explorations. Instead, Stereophonics adapted the anthemic roar of their Welsh forefathers Manic Street Preachers, substituting the Manics' Guns N' Roses fascination with a love of Nirvana, and then made big arena rock, tempered slightly with rambling acoustic singalongs straight out of Oasis and vague electronica-flavored pop. All this is chronicled on Decade in the Sun: The Best of Stereophonics, the group's first hits compilation and one that traces its evolution effectively, if not quite entertainingly. Decade in the Sun is too comprehensive to be entertaining, as it drags its heels over 20 tracks that all sound huge and hookless to those listeners not subjected to these tunes as part of the general cultural fabric. For British listeners, this is a good sampling of what they heard in the background for a decade, but Decade in the Sun winds up convincing anybody outside of the U.K. that there are some perfectly good reasons why Stereophonics never translated across the Atlantic.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:607c050e625cb24dee0644c6d060182e0a917172","amp;dn":"Stereophonics+-+Decade+In+The+Sun%282008%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"607c050e625cb24dee0644c6d060182e0a917172","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,124,5,14,98,92,178,77,238,6,68,198,208,96,24,46,10,145,113,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
