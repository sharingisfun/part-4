The Strokes were the first band to break into the mainstream as part of the turn-of-the-millennium garage rock trend. Hyped by the music press for their melodic pop-influenced garage rock sound on both sides of the Atlantic, The Strokes' auspicious debut garnered them critical and popular attention, as well as a backlash from listeners turned off by the hype. Nonetheless, Is This It's more famous songs &quot;The Modern Age&quot;, &quot;Last Nite&quot;, &quot;Hard to Explain&quot; and &quot;Someday&quot; won the band much respect and helped the album reach number two in the UK and number thirty-three in the US. This album is featured in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n\nTrack Listing\n1 - Is This It\n2 - The Modern Age\n3 - Soma\n4 - Barely Legal\n5 - Someday\n6 - Alone, Together\n7 - Last Nite\n8 - Hard To Explain\n9 - New York City Cops\n10 - Trying Your Luck\n11 - Take It Or Leave It\n\nAll tracks are DRM-free and encoded losslessly in FLAC format (16 bit, stereo, 44.1 kHz).
