It is a book of many hundreds of pages, despite the fact that lack of space has forced the exclusion of many photographers with a clear title to presentation of their work. In the last twenty-five years, the body of distinguished photographic art has grown to vast  proportions. Nevertheless, the art of photography is only a small part of the  enormous photographic enterprise, which is one of the momentous developments in the history of human expression and communication.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39ad0e8b165f3b0f3f77d39c551bd3c4ce1c8fee","amp;dn":"The+Picture+History+of+Photography+-+From+the+earliest+beginning","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39ad0e8b165f3b0f3f77d39c551bd3c4ce1c8fee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,173,14,139,22,95,59,15,63,119,211,156,85,27,211,196,206,28,143,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
