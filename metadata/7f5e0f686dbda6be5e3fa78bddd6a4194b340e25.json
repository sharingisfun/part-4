The musical emphasis is more on expansive arrangements and a generally gentler, acoustic or soft electric vibe; still an apocalyptic glam suite, from heavy guitar riffing to eastern European-sounding pastorals. Kosmische Musik, a groove record.  Yeti and Phallus Dei are fiercer, but don't really cover the ground Lemminge does. It is an absolute milestone in progressive psychedelic music. \n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Krautrock is a German avant-garde / experimental rock movement that emerged at the end of the 1960's. The term krautrock was originally a humorous one coined by the UK music press (such as New Musical Express and Melody Maker), where &quot;krautrock&quot; found an early and enthusiastic underground following. \nJulian Cope, in his book Krautrocksampler, says &quot;Krautrock is a subjective British phenomenon,&quot; based on the way the music was received in the UK rather than on the actual West German music scene out of which it grew.  The term is also a problematic category due to the considerable differences between the artists so labelled.\nKey artists associated with the tag include Can, Amon DÃƒÂ¼ÃƒÂ¼l II, Ash Ra Tempel, Faust, Popol Vuh, Cluster, Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, Neu!, and Kraftwerk.\n\n\n\n\n\nStraight, no chaser.\n:)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f5e0f686dbda6be5e3fa78bddd6a4194b340e25","amp;dn":"Amon+Duul+II+-+Tanz+der+Lemminge+1971+%2F+2002+Reissue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f5e0f686dbda6be5e3fa78bddd6a4194b340e25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,94,15,104,109,189,166,190,94,63,167,139,221,214,164,25,75,52,14,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
