Trained in tactics and psychology, they deal with extreme situations, where split-second decisions could save a life... or cost one. This year, after battles fought against many thematic backdrops - the human cost of heroism, the true meaning of a team, the powerful bonds of family, the many faces of sacrifice - Flashpoint comes full circle with the theme of Keeping the Peace. Season V finds Team One facing its toughest challenges yet, ones that make its members wrestle with the very reasons they chose their paths as police officers. For Team One, the duty to keep the peace is one it performs proudly... until its faith is shaken by events beyond its control. What is this 'peace' that we protect? What happens when it doesn't feel the same as justice? In this fifth and final season, Team One questions what it's always taken for granted, and as it continues it's fight to save lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddc61083f3cbf28b68893238e7446fab480bf6d7","amp;dn":"Flashpoint+Season+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddc61083f3cbf28b68893238e7446fab480bf6d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,198,16,131,243,203,242,139,104,137,50,56,231,68,111,171,72,11,246,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
