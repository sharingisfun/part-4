Iron Claw definitely applies to the terminology of the time, with hard, negative blues riffing, awesome guitar work and some cool use of the mellotron . These Scots were compatriots, some say rip-offs of Sabbath and Budgie, but it&amp;#039;s damn good anyway. &quot;Ugly music for ugly droogs&quot;. \n\n=================================================================================\nIf you have any of the following, please share!\n\nEL RITUAL (MEX) s/t 1974\nEUCLID Heavy Equipment 1970\nFRACTION Moon Blood\nHACKENSACK Live The Hardway\nHACKENSACK Give it Some\nHAIRY CHAPTER Eyes\nHAIRY CHAPTER Can&amp;#039;t get through\nHARD STUFF Bolex Dementia\nHARD STUFF Bulletproof\nICECROSS s/t 1973\nJERUSALEM s/t 1972\nJOSEFUS Dead Man/Get Off My Case\nORANG-UTAN s/t\nRED DIRT Plus\nSILBERBART Four Times Sound Razing\nSUDDEN DEATH Suddenly\nTEAR GAS s/t\nTIGER B.
