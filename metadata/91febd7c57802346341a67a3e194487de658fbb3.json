Other important members during the next two decades included Djong Yun, Conny Veit, Daniel Fichelscher, Klaus Wiese and Robert Eliscu. The band took its name from the Popol Vuh, a manuscript containing the mythology of the Post-Classic QuichÃƒÂ© Maya people of highland Guatemala and south east Mexico; the name translates roughly as &quot;meeting place&quot;. In the QuichÃƒÂ© language Popol Vuh translates as: &quot;Book of the Community&quot;, &quot;Book of Counsel&quot;, or more literally as &quot;Book of the People&quot;.\nThe first album, Affenstunde, released in 1970, can be regarded as one of the earliest space music works, featuring the then new sounds of the Moog synthesizer together with ethnic percussion. This continued for only one more album, In den GÃƒÂ¤rten Pharaos, and material later to be released on the soundtrack to &quot;Aguirre&quot;, before Fricke largely abandoned electronic instruments in favor of piano-led compositions from 1972's Hosianna Mantra forward. This album also marked the start of exploring overtly religious themes rather than a more generally spiritual feeling within the music. The group evolved to include all kinds of instruments: wind and strings, electric and acoustic alike, combined to convey a mystical aura that made their music spiritual and introspective.\nPopol Vuh influenced many other bands from Europe with their uniquely soft but elaborate instrumentation, that took inspiration from Tibet, Africa, and pre-Columbian America. They created dream-like soundscapes along with psychedelic walls of sound, and are regarded as precursors of contemporary world music, as well of new age music and ambient music.\nThe band contributed soundtracks to the films of Werner Herzog, including Aguirre, the Wrath of God, Nosferatu, Fitzcarraldo, Cobra Verde, Heart of Glass and The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser, in which Fricke appeared.\nFlorian Fricke died in Munich on December 29, 2001, and the group disbanded.\nIn October 2003 Klaus Schulze wrote:\n&quot;Florian was and remains an important forerunner of contemporary ethnic and religious music. He chose electronic music and his big Moog to free himself from the restraints of traditional music, but soon discovered that he didn't get a lot out of it and opted for the acoustic path instead. Here, he went on to create a new world, which Werner Herzog loves so much, transforming the thought patterns of electronic music into the language of acoustic ethno music.&quot;\n\n\nCountry: German\nGenre: Krautrock / Ambient / New Age\nQuality: 320 kbps / FLAC\n\nAlbum List:\n(1970) Popol Vuh - Affenstunde [2004 Remaster]\n(1971) Popol Vuh - In den Garten Pharaos\n(1972) Popol Vuh - Hosianna Mantra\n(1973) Popol Vuh - Seligpreisung\n(1974) Popol Vuh - EinsjÃƒÂ¤ger &amp; SiebenjÃƒÂ¤ger\n(1975) Popol Vuh - Das Hohelied Salomos\n(1976) Popol Vuh - Letzte Tage-Letzte Nachte\n(1976) Popol Vuh - Yoga [1993 reissue]\n(1978) Popol Vuh - BrÃƒÂ¼der des Schattens - SÃƒÂ¶hne des Lichts\n(1979) Popol Vuh - Die Nacht der Seele\n(1981) Popol Vuh - Sei still, wisse ICH BIN\n(1983) Popol Vuh - Agape-Agape Love-Love [2004 remaster]\n(1985) Popol Vuh - Spirit of Peace\n(1991) Popol Vuh - For You And Me [2006 reissue]\n(1993) Popol Vuh - Sing, For Song Drives Away The Wolves\n(1995) Popol Vuh - City Raga\n(1997) Popol Vuh - Shepherd's Symphony - Hirtensymphonie [2004 reissue]\n(1999) Popol Vuh - Messa Di Orfeo [192 kbps]\n\nOriginal Soundtrack [FLAC]\n(1975) Popol Vuh - Aguirre\n(1975) Popol Vuh - Herz aus Glas - Coeur de Verre\n(1978) Popol Vuh - Nosferatu\n(1982) Popol Vuh - Fitzcarraldo\n(1987) Popol Vuh - Cobra Verde\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91febd7c57802346341a67a3e194487de658fbb3","amp;dn":"Popol+Vuh+Discography+%5B18+albums+%40320%2C+1+album+%40192%2C+5+albums+FL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91febd7c57802346341a67a3e194487de658fbb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,254,189,124,87,128,35,70,52,26,103,163,225,148,72,125,230,88,251,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
