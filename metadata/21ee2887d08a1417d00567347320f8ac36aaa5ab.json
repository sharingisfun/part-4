The concept that John Jeavons and the team at Ecology Action launched more than 40 years ago has been embraced by the mainstream and continues to gather momentum.\n\n Today, How to Grow More Vegetables, now in its fully revised and updated 8th edition, is the go-to reference for food growers at every level: from home gardeners dedicated to nurturing their backyard edibles in maximum harmony with natureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cycles, to small-scale commercial producers interested in optimizing soil fertility and increasing plant productivity. Whether you hope to harvest your first tomatoes next summer or are planning to grow enough to feed your whole family in years to come, How to Grow More Vegetables is your indispensable sustainable garden guide.\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n\n\n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/6734/b54bfa2c.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21ee2887d08a1417d00567347320f8ac36aaa5ab","amp;dn":"How+to+Grow+More+Vegetables%2C+Eighth+Edition%3A+Fruits%2C+Nuts%2C+Berri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21ee2887d08a1417d00567347320f8ac36aaa5ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,238,40,135,208,138,20,23,208,5,103,52,115,32,248,172,54,170,165,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
