The only question is: Can Mitch Rapp find him first?\n\nJoe Rickman, head of CIA clandestine operations in Afghanistan, has been kidnapped and his four bodyguards executed in cold blood. But Mitch RappÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s experience and nose for the truth make him wonder if something even more sinister isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t afoot. Irene Kennedy, director of the CIA, has dispatched him to Afghanistan to find Rickman at all costs.\n\nRapp, however, isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the only one looking for Rickman. The FBI is too, and it quickly becomes apparent that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re less concerned with finding Rickman than placing the blame on Rapp.\n\nWith CIA operations in crisis, Rapp must be as ruthless and deceitful as his enemies if he has any hope of finding Rickman and completing his mission. But with elements within his own government working against both him and American interests, will Rapp be stopped dead before he can succeed?\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Mobi. I recommend you download his bibliography that I uploaded since the ebook style goes along with this release. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7696613/Vince_Flynn_Bibliography_(ePub__Mobi__AZW3_Retail)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7696613/Vince_Flynn_Bibliography_(ePub__Mobi__AZW3_Retail)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60ae6f4545572112e5a4febcad7e3608829e1798","amp;dn":"The+Last+Man+by+Vince+Flynn+%28ePub%2C+Mobi+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60ae6f4545572112e5a4febcad7e3608829e1798","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,174,111,69,69,87,33,18,229,164,254,188,173,126,54,8,130,158,23,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
