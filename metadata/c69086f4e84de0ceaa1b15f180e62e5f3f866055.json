And it's easy to see why Snake has been so popular--it's easily the most engaging of Jackie Chan's early films. Everyone abuses and humiliates a downtrodden orphan (Chan) until he befriends an old man, who turns out to be the last master of the &quot;snake fist&quot; fighting style. Jackie becomes the old man's student and finds himself in battle with the master of the &quot;eagle's claw&quot; style, who has vowed to destroy the snake fist clan. Though these plot elements are familiar stuff, they're all executed with outstanding verve; the performances, the fight choreography, and even the obligatory training sequence are unusually complex and well filmed. Jackie is in top form and coming into his own as a star.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVIDEO:\n------\n\nCodec4cc:\t\tDX50 (DivX)\nImage Size:\t\t720 x 576\nAspect Ratio:\t\t16:9 (64:45)\nFrame Rate:\t\t25fps\nFrame Count:\t\t138917\nTotal Duration:\t\t1:32:36.680\n\n------\nAUDIO:\n------\n\nCodec:\t\t\tMp3\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nBitrate:\t\t16000Bps/128kbps\nVariable Bitrate:\tYes\nSample Rate:\t\t48000Hz\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is one of may favourite 'early' Jackie Chan films. I have ripped straight from a DVD that i own, however it has not been re-mastered so don't expect the same quality as the other releases that I have been putting up lately. I decided to put in the cantonese audio with english subs coz the english dub was a bit wack. Anyway.. As always enjoy some quality kung fu\tand remember.... Violence is very entertaining :)\n\nPeace\n\n-&lt;SyMbIoTe&gt;-\t\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c69086f4e84de0ceaa1b15f180e62e5f3f866055","amp;dn":"Snake+In+The+Eagles+Shadow+%5B1978%5D+DvDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c69086f4e84de0ceaa1b15f180e62e5f3f866055","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,144,134,244,232,77,224,206,170,27,21,241,128,230,46,95,63,134,96,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
