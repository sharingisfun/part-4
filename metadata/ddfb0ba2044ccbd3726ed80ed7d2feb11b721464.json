But before she ends it all, Nao plans to document the life of her great-grandmother, a Buddhist nun whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lived more than a century. A diary is NaoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only solaceÃ¢â‚¬â€and will touch lives in a ways she can scarcely imagine.\n\nAcross the Pacific, we meet Ruth, a novelist living on a remote island who discovers a collection of artifacts washed ashore in a Hello Kitty lunchboxÃ¢â‚¬â€possibly debris from the devastating 2011 tsunami. As the mystery of its contents unfolds, Ruth is pulled into the past, into NaoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drama and her unknown fate, and forward into her own future.\n \n\nFull of OzekiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s signature humour and deeply engaged with the relationship between writer and reader, past and present, fact and fiction, quantum physics, history, and myth, A Tale for the Time Being is a brilliantly inventive, beguiling story of our shared humanity and the search for home.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddfb0ba2044ccbd3726ed80ed7d2feb11b721464","amp;dn":"A+Tale+for+the+Time+Being+-+Ruth+Ozeki","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddfb0ba2044ccbd3726ed80ed7d2feb11b721464","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,251,11,162,4,76,203,211,114,110,216,14,215,210,254,177,27,114,20,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
