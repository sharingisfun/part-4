Reinventing the House\nBattles break out over the future of the House. Speaker John Bercow runs into trouble with his own plans for reforming it. Wealthy Tory backbencher Zac Goldsmith tries to give voters the power to sack their MPs - and the establishment tries to stop him. Plus the ongoing struggle to conserve the Victorian mock-gothic palace and anticipate the challenges of carrying out a multi-billion pound programme of restoration work whilst the House is sitting. David Purdue of the events and banqueting team is part of a new initiative to raise money for the upkeep of the House by hosting fashion shows and film premieres inside the House. At the end of a remarkable year, conflict continues between those who celebrate the Commons' historic traditions and those who believe it needs to be dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century, as MPs gear up for the general election. Many face the prospect of losing their jobs. The ever-changing House of Commons will soon have a new intake of MPs, and new challenges to face.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;da92b3bdb29a96e9f4eb&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 22.5 (~1300Kbps)\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nVideo Resolution: 1024x576\nFrame Rate: 25 FPS\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 38 mins\nNumber of Parts: 4\nPart Size: 609 MB\nSource: HDTV\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a793f7c72563c84940cf2adb2decc2493cf55ad","amp;dn":"BBC.Inside.the.Commons.4of4.576p.HDTV.x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a793f7c72563c84940cf2adb2decc2493cf55ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,121,63,124,114,86,60,132,148,12,242,173,178,222,204,36,147,207,85,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
