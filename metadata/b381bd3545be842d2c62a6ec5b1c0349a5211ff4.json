From the author of The Doors of Perception, Island, and countless other works of fiction, non-fiction, philosophy, and poetry, comes this powerful work of speculative fiction that has enthralled and terrified readers for generations. Brave New World remains absolutely relevant to this day as both a cautionary dystopian tale in the vein of the George Orwell classic 1984, and as thought-provoking, thoroughly satisfying entertainment.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b381bd3545be842d2c62a6ec5b1c0349a5211ff4","amp;dn":"BRAVE+NEW+WORLD+by+Aldous+Huxley+%28Unabridged+mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b381bd3545be842d2c62a6ec5b1c0349a5211ff4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,129,189,53,69,190,132,45,44,98,166,236,91,28,3,73,165,33,31,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
