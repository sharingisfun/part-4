Since his death in 1966, there have been dozens of hit compilations. Luckily, this collection contains most of Solis's biggest hits: &quot;Payaso,&quot; &quot;Cenizas,&quot; &quot;Sombras,&quot; &quot;Media Vuelta,&quot; &quot;Lloraras, Lloraras,&quot; and &quot;Si Dios Me Quita la Vida.&quot; And while Solis got most of the credit, it's important to remember he worked with topflight producers, studio musicians, and, most critical of all, excellent song material from Rafael Ramirez (&quot;Lloraras, Lloraras&quot;), Luis Demetrio (&quot;Si Dios Me Quita la Vida&quot;), and Jose Alfredo Jimenez (&quot;Media Vuelta&quot;). But the combined power of vivid tearjerker songs enveloped in gorgeous mariachi arrangements is nothing without Solis's exquisite vocals and tough but compassionate stance.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a688f12dc5b00cd220ac5e334fb40b6f8be59fb","amp;dn":"Javier+Solis-+La+Historia+De+Javier+Solis+%28m4a+320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a688f12dc5b00cd220ac5e334fb40b6f8be59fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,104,143,18,220,91,0,205,34,10,197,227,52,251,64,182,248,190,89,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
