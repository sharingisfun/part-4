Presented across two CDs (one subtitled Blues, Jazz &amp; Gospel and the other subtitled Blues &amp; Jazz), Barber's precious Memories are highlighted by admirers such as Muddy Waters, Keith Emerson, Eric Clapton, Van Morrison and others from outside the traditional jazz realm.\nFolk-blues legends Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee climb onboard the blues classic &quot;When Things Go Wrong&quot; with British vocalist Ottile Patterson and give it a long slow ride back through music history to that point where blues and jazz merge on the horizon. &quot;Kansas City&quot; captures a rolling and tumbling snapshot of roughly-hewn blues from one of Muddy Waters' greatest bands (featuring pianist Pinetop Perkins), with Barber's trombone solo growling below Bob Margolin's electric blues guitar. Barber's trombone also helps moan and cry the blues shuffle &quot;Weeping Willow,&quot; which Eric Clapton impeccably renders on vocals and slide guitar. Disc one also features guitarists Alexis Corner, who blows through James Cotton's howling, cavernous &quot;Love Me or Leave Me,&quot; and a rare live Rory Gallagher's recording of &quot;Can't Be Satisfied&quot; released by permission of Gallagher's estate.\nThis first CD closes with a Van Morrison trilogy that features him thoroughly at home, on vocals and harmonica, in the medium he haunts bestÃ¢â‚¬â€the bluesÃ¢â‚¬â€concluding with the glorious and rollicking &quot;Oh, Didn't He Ramble&quot; from sessions that Barber and Morrison recorded with New Orleans pianist Dr. John for Morrison's landmark A Period of Transition (Warner Bros., 1977).\nOn the second disc, progressive rock greybeard Keith Emerson lets his funky small combo roots show through Jack McDuff's compact, crunchy instrumental &quot;Rock Candy.&quot; Jools Holland rips off &quot;Winin' Boy Blues&quot; like a weathered bluesman surrounded by the joyous Dixieland sound of jazz-blues syncopation, with which he strolls more casually &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street.&quot; &quot;Jack Teagarden Blues&quot; captures a small club date where Barber exchanges trombone blues with Count Basie guitarist, arranger and trombonist Eddie Durham.\nThree tunes with guitarist Mark Knopfler help Barber bring the curtain down. Thanks to Vic Pitts' loping bass line and Barber's harmony vocal, &quot;Blues Stay Away From Me&quot; introduces another jazz flavorÃ¢â‚¬â€country-swing jazzÃ¢â‚¬â€into Barber's hearty roots stew. After ripping up the &quot;Dallas Rag&quot; (first recorded by Dallas String Band band in the 1920s), Barber and Knopfler and friends bid ya'all a good night &quot; 'Till the Next Time I'm in Town,&quot; a perfectly relaxed yet swinging way to closeÃ¢â‚¬â€until next timeÃ¢â‚¬â€Barber's Memories of My Trip.
