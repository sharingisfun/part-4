Building on the successes of the first two games, DIII introduces a host of new features as well as the compelling gameplay that made the previous titles such hits. \nAs a Lord of one of the fantastical races of Nevendaar you must fight to restore your deity's rule over your world. There are three playable races to choose from; the Empire, the Elven Alliance and the notorious Legion of the Damned.\nFor the first time in the series the gloriously ominous and notoriously gloomy world of Disciples is rendered in full 3D, allowing the player to experience this realm as it should be. Disciples uses its own Virtual Dream engine to render the stunning 3D environments.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:689ca60414698a52d51a9b3cbae82b75a8a108da","amp;dn":"Disciples+3%3A+Renaissance+%282009%29+RUS+%5BL%5D+RePack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"689ca60414698a52d51a9b3cbae82b75a8a108da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,156,166,4,20,105,138,82,213,26,155,60,186,232,43,117,168,161,8,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
