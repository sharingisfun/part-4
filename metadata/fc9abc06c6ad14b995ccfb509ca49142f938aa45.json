OpenCV is an open-source library with over 2500 algorithms that you can use to do all of these, as well as track moving objects, extract 3D models, and overlay augmented reality. It's used by major companies like Google (in its autonomous car), Intel, and Sony; and it is the backbone of the Robot Operating SystemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s computer vision capability. In short, if you're working with computer vision at all, you need to know OpenCV.\n\nWith Practical OpenCV, you'll be able to:\n\n    -Get OpenCV up and running on Windows or Linux.\n    -Use OpenCV to control the camera board and run vision algorithms on Raspberry Pi.\n    -Understand what goes on behind the scenes in computer vision applications like object detection, image stitching, filtering, stereo vision, and more.\n    -Code complex computer vision projects for your class/hobby/robot/job, many of which can execute in real time on off-the-shelf processors.\n    -Combine different modules that you develop to create your own interactive computer vision app.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc9abc06c6ad14b995ccfb509ca49142f938aa45","amp;dn":"Practical+OpenCV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc9abc06c6ad14b995ccfb509ca49142f938aa45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,154,188,6,198,173,20,185,149,204,251,80,156,164,145,66,249,56,170,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
