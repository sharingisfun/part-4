Share everything!\nDon't believe the lies brought to us by the same governments and media that \ntold us there were 'Weapons Of Mass Destruction' in Iraq. It is the western\nbacked terror groups that are using chemical weapons and that are behind \nthe violence in Syria. The government and people of Syria have the right to\ndefend themselves against this aggression being orchestrated from grand \nhalls of over abroad. The only people that will benefit from a war on\nSyria are the Global 1% Ruling Class. They will end up spending billions,\nmaybe even trillions, of dollars on war and then saying the people must \nhave cutbacks and austerity. While the men, women and children of Syria \nwill be getting robbed, raped, terrorized, tortured and murdered by the \nmost high tech, advanced weapons in the world. Hands off Syria, no war!!\n\nStop The War Coalition, UK:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.stopwar.org.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.stopwar.org.uk/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nUnited National Antiwar Coalition, US:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.unacpeace.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.unacpeace.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInternational Action Center &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iacenter.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iacenter.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNoWarOnSyria RG Home:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.SUMOTorrent.sx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.SUMOTorrent.sx&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSCREENS: (if problem viewing, copy and paste URL in browser)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img6/5321/jbsu.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img6/5321/jbsu.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img94/927/xh05.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img94/927/xh05.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img194/9459/rmhf.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img194/9459/rmhf.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img94/3179/b8cf.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img94/3179/b8cf.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img827/3074/etvj.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img827/3074/etvj.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img844/8587/ivez.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img844/8587/ivez.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee720ed8c90b2685fb2122c8ae63d0dcd9b5d724","amp;dn":"The+Worlds+End+2013+R6+HDRip+XviD-NoWarOnSyria","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee720ed8c90b2685fb2122c8ae63d0dcd9b5d724","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,114,14,216,201,11,38,133,251,33,34,200,174,99,208,220,217,181,215,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
