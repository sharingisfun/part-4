It's a 24/7 job with a lousy benefits package.\n\nMaddy's position may come with magical powers and an impressive wingspan, but it doesn't pay the bills. And then there are her infuriating boss, tenant woes, and a cranky, popcorn-loving gargoyle to contend with.\n\nThings start looking up, though, when tall, dark, and handsome Gabriel Angeloscuro agrees to rent the empty apartment in Maddy's building. It's probably just a coincidence that as soon as he moves in demons appear on the front lawn. But when an unholy monster is unleashed upon the streets of Chicago, Maddy discovers powers she never knew she possessed. Powers linked to a family legacy of tarnished halos.\n\nPowers that place her directly between the light of Heaven and the fires of Hell...\n\n- - -\n\n#2 - Black Night\n\nIf obstinate dead people were all that Maddy had to worry about, life would be much easier. But the best-laid plans of Agents and fallen angels often go awry. Deaths are occurring contrary to the natural order, Maddy's being stalked by foes inside and outside of her family, and her two loves-her bodyguard, Gabriel, and her doughnut-loving gargoyle, Beezle-have disappeared. But because Maddy is Lucifer's granddaughter, things are expected of her, things like delicate diplomatic missions to other realms.\n\n- - -\n\n#3 - Black Howl\n\nSomething is wrong with the souls of Chicago's dead. Ghosts are walking the streets, and Maddy's boss wants her to figure out why. At the same time, the pact that Maddy unwittingly made with the local werewolves comes back to bite her when their alpha is kidnapped. As Lucifer's heir, she should be able to discover whoÃ¢â‚¬â€or whatÃ¢â‚¬â€is responsible for both occurrences, but the fallen haven't been too happy with her since she agreed to harbor Gabriel's half brother, Samiel.\n\nAnd while work is bad enough, Maddy has a plethora of personal problems, too. Now that Gabriel has been assigned as her thrall, their relationship has hit an impasse. At least her sleazy ex-fiancÃƒÂ©, Nathaniel, is out of the pictureÃ¢â‚¬â€or so she thinks...\n\n- - -\n\n#4 - Black Lament\n\nDevastated and grieving, Maddy unexpectedly finds hope with the discovery that she is pregnant. But Maddy's joy is short lived when Lucifer informs her that he wants the baby, hoping to draw on the combined power of two of his bloodlines. Maddy is determined that her grandfather will never have her child, but sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not sure what she can do to stop him.\n\nBeing pregnant is stressful enough, but Maddy suddenly finds herself at odds with the AgencyÃ¢â‚¬â€forbidden from meddling in the affairs of the supernatural courts. When a few of her soul collections go awry, Maddy begins to suspect that the Agency wants to terminate her employment. They should know by now that she isn't the sort to give up without a fight.\n\n- - -\n\n#5 - Black City\n\nWhen Maddy finally killed her father, Azazel, she thought his depraved experiment died with him. But now Chicago has been infested with vampires immune to the effects of the sun, and the bloodbath is worse than she could have ever imagined. While the Agency refuses to interfere with other supernatural courts, Maddy is determined to do everything within her power to save her cityÃ¢â‚¬â€wings or no wings. \n\nBut when the leader of the vampires requests that she turn herself in or risk more deaths, Maddy becomes a target for the very people sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trying to save. Left with no other choice, she turns to Lucifer, the one creature who has the power to help her. But her grandfatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s aid has always come at a priceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n- - -\n\n#6 - Black Heart\n\nAs a former Agent of Death, Madeline Black is no stranger to witnessing violent ends. But being the one to cause them is an entirely different storyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nDespite her having saved Chicago from a vampire invasion, the Agency wants to get Maddy off their payrollÃ¢â‚¬â€permanently. With the deadly Retrievers hot on her trail, she has no choice but to trust Nathaniel to port her to safety. But even the exotic and dangerous world that she winds up in is not as peaceful as she would have hoped. Caught in a turf war between a group of fae and a disturbingly familiar foe, Maddy soon discovers that the twisted plots of her grandfather, Lucifer, and his brothers extend even into this unknown realm.\n\nNow, with enemies gathering on all sides, MaddyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fate is looking darker than ever. And to protect her unborn son from her adversaries, she may have to tap into a power she hoped never to accessÃ¢â‚¬Â¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7715793b0e7e4e189e526be73b32c46e223abad","amp;dn":"Black+Wings+Series+%28Books+1-6%29+-+Christina+Henry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7715793b0e7e4e189e526be73b32c46e223abad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,113,87,147,176,231,228,225,137,229,38,190,115,179,44,70,226,35,171,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
