From top needlework designers Rita Weiss and Jean Leinhauser come 100 of the very best, in a variety of sizes, styles, and colors. They range from a tiny amulet bag to wear as a necklace to a giant felted tote, and include backpacks, beach bags, and elegant evening clutches. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a jeweled iPod case, a special carry-all for a yoga mat, and a traditional string bag for a bottle of wine. And for that special child: a purse shaped like a toy elephant or one thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a teddy bear! Each one features detailed instructions and a magnificent photo of the finished project.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11ea6de2d334e81a6fbc96e133b2976779862b16","amp;dn":"100+Purses+to+Knit+and+Crochet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11ea6de2d334e81a6fbc96e133b2976779862b16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,234,109,226,211,52,232,26,111,188,150,225,51,178,151,103,121,134,43,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
