Although the rigorous training takes its toll on both teacher and students, there is plenty of time for relationships to develop between the three. Based on their teacher's reputation, Sophie and Jean are invited to participate in a singing contest staged by Prince Scotti. Scotti's protege is set up to get revenge for Scotti's defeat at the hands of Dallayrac in a similar competition many years ago. The young students overcome Scotti's trickery to win the competition. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDVD Rip (not mine)\nVÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­deo Codec: Div3\nVÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­deo Bitrate: 1705 Kbps\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½udio Codec: AC3\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½udio Bitrate: 448 Kbps\nResolution: 640x352\nFrame Rate: 23.976 FPS\nSize: 1,36 Gb (2 Cds)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Freakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
