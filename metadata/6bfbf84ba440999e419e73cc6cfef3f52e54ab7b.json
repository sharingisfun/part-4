Eventually, after \nyears of tyranny and chaos, the good armies of the nearby lands, headed by \nthe infamous Circle of Eight descended into the temple and razed it, \nimprisoning the villains inside. For years thereafter relative peace \nensued, as daring adventurers slew the remaining monsters that ravaged the \nland above and the temple itself faded into but a distant memory...until \nnow\n\nBandits have begun to patrol the roads outside Hommlet and Nulb again. \nWicked forces are rumored to be afoot, converging on the ruined temple for \nmalevolent purposes. Who and what these men are, no one can be sure. All \nclaim to be bent on slaying monsters and bringing peace and security to \nHommlet; but deeds speak more loudly than words, and lies cloak the true \npurposes of the malevolent. \n\nSo begins the classic Gygax D&amp;D module, The Temple of Elemental EvilÃ£Æ’Â» \nbrought to the PC for the first time with 3.5 Edition rules by Troika \nGames.
