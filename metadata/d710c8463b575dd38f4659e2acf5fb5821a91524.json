Revised, enlarged and translated by Norman Thomas di Giovanni in collaboration with the author.\n\n172 pages | PDF\n\n\nThe Book of Imaginary Beings was originally published in 1957 as Manual de zoologÃƒÂ­a fantÃƒÂ¡stica (&quot;Handbook of Fantastic Zoology&quot;), and expanded in 1967 and 1969 to the final El libro de los seres imaginarios.  The English edition, created in collaboration with translator Norman Thomas di Giovanni, contains descriptions of 120 mythical beasts from folklore and literature.\n\nIn the preface, Borges writes that &quot;there is a kind of lazy pleasure in useless and out-of-the-way erudition. The compilation and translation of this volume have given us a great deal of such pleasure; we hope the reader will share something of the fun we felt when ransacking the bookshelves of our friends and the mazelike vaults of the Biblioteca Nacional in search of old authors and abstruse references.&quot;\n\nThe book, he says, is to be read &quot;as with all miscellanies ... not straight through... Rather we would like the reader to dip into the pages at random, just as one plays with the shifting patterns of a kaleidoscope.&quot;\n\nIt is sure to delight readers of classic fantasy as well as Borges's many admirers.\n\nFor a list of the creatures mentioned in the book, see the Wikipedia article at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Imaginary_Beings\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d710c8463b575dd38f4659e2acf5fb5821a91524","amp;dn":"Jorge+Luis+Borges+-+The+Book+of+Imaginary+Beings+%281974%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d710c8463b575dd38f4659e2acf5fb5821a91524","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,16,200,70,59,87,93,211,143,70,89,226,172,245,251,88,33,169,21,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
