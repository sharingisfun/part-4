The follow-up to 2010's &quot;The Epigenesis&quot;\n\n\nAlmost all of the music and lyrics was again written and produced by MELECHESH mainman Ashmedi.\n\n\nMELECHESH spent one month in its rehearsal room in Hinzweiler, Germany preparing the material before entering the recording studio in Athens, Greece. The band wanted a Mediterranean place to capture the essence of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s origins.\n\n\n&quot;Enki&quot; features 12-string electric guitars aside from the 6-string played on the entire album, for a heavier and subtly richer harmonic sound. The band also tuned their instruments to the pitch-perfect 432 Hz frequency rather than the standardized 440 Hz one for a deeper sonic experience within the human psyche and in accordance to vibrations of the universe. &quot;Enki&quot; also features esteemed friends of the MELECHESH society guest vocalists Max Cavalera (SOULFLY, SEPULTURA) and Sakis Tolis (ROTTING CHRIST) as well as guest lead by Rob Caggiano (VOLBEAT, ANTHRAX).\n\n\nWith so many nationalities in the band, MELECHESH have become more comfortable at being labelled as an act from planet earth or just Jerusalem without adhering to any man-made virtual borders. To the band, this is metaphorical rebellion.\n\nLine-Up:\nAshmedi - vocals / guitar\nScorpios- bass/backing vocals\nMoloch- guitar\nLord Curse - drums Live :\nNomadic souls - drums and second guitar\n\n\nGuest Musicians:\nMax Cavalera (Soulfly, Sepultura)\nSakis Tolis (Rotting Christ)\nRob Caggiano (Volbeat, Anthrax)\n\n\n\n\nDiscography:\nAs Jerusalem Burns...
