Aubin creates standardized content such as furniture, doors, and many other architectural components using The Family Editor in Revit. The course starts with the basic concepts: family hierarchy, libraries, resources, reference planes, and constraints. The course also takes a deeper look at the smart data beyond the geometry, such as material and visibility parameters, as well as creating nested families and arrays, controlling rotation in work planes, and working with advanced formulas.\nTopics include:\n\n    Understanding family concepts\n    Creating an annotation vs. a model family\n    Adding geometry\n    Working with reference planes and constraints\n    Creating extrusions, blends, and sweeps\n    Creating parametric relationships\n    Editing element visibility\n    Building complex families\n    Adding conditional formulas\n    Creating towers and arches","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82669b6efc1819dae8354ea10e47cf1ebeeb6758","amp;dn":"Lynda-+Revit+Architecture%3A+The+Family+Editor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82669b6efc1819dae8354ea10e47cf1ebeeb6758","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,102,155,110,252,24,25,218,232,53,78,161,14,71,207,30,190,235,103,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
