The Postal Dude also wears a Happy Smiley pin on his right lapel and a cross pin on his left one. The Postal Dude lives in a trailer park with his nagging wife (only identified in the credits as 'Postal Dude's Bitch') in the town of Paradise, Arizona.\n\nThe game levels are split into days of the week starting Monday and finishing Friday. At the beginning of each day, Dude is given several tasks to accomplish, such as 'Get milk', 'Confess sins', and other seemingly mundane tasks. The purpose of the game is to finish all of the tasks throughout the week, and the player can accomplish these tasks in any way he wishes, be it as civilly or as chaotically as possible (it is possible, if occasionally difficult, to complete most tasks without engaging in battle, or, at least, killing other people). The daily tasks can be accomplished in any order, and the game includes one task that is only activated on a certain day if Dude performs a certain action.\n\nDude must put up with being flipped the bird, mugged, attacked by protesters, put upon by an obnoxious convenience store owner/terrorist and his patrons who cut before Dude in the &quot;money-line&quot;, plus a marching band, a murderous toy mascot named Krotchy, the police and SWAT team, the ATF and the National Guard, a religious cult, savage butchers, psycho Al-Qaeda terrorists, and Gary Coleman, among many other things.\n-------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n***Gameplay***\nOne of the major concepts of Postal 2 is that it is meant to be a &quot;living world&quot;, a simulation of a tongue-in-cheek off-kilter town. Game characters live out their lives completely separate from the actions of Dude; walking around town, buying and selling merchandise, and even engaging in random shootouts with each other and the police.\n[edit] Comparison with Grand Theft Auto\n\nLike the Grand Theft Auto series, the game aims to be non-linear by allowing Postal Dude to explore the town of Paradise. At first, the Postal Dude can only enter the neighborhood areas directly adjacent to his own neighborhood, but new areas are unlocked as each day of the week passes. However, the local inhabitants also become progressively more violent and heavily armed as the week goes on, and on the final two days of the week, SWAT teams and National Guard squads patrolling Paradise wear heavy body armor and are well-armed. According to the storyline, they are there for a convention and in response to a request for assistance hunting down a spree killer. (It is implied that the killer is Postal Dude, regardless of whether or not he has been killing people during the course of the game.)\n\nUnlike Grand Theft Auto, the game world is not one single large continuous map, but rather several different neighborhood maps broken up by loading zones (which are marked by road signs saying 'Load Zone'). One of the main gameplay complaints about the game upon its initial release was that the loading time for each new map was extremely long, seriously interrupting the flow of gameplay and reducing the motivation for exploring new areas. The vendor-released 1337 patch managed to significantly reduce load times.\n\nMissions work differently than in Grand Theft Auto. Instead of choosing a mission and then carrying it out from the beginning to its end, players are given a series of tasks at the start of each day. They can then complete the tasks in any order they like, as they go along without having to specifically select them or initiate any missions.\n---------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n***Gary Coleman cameos***\nThe game also features a cameo by Gary Coleman, acting as himself, who appears early on as the objective of one of the game's tasks (travel to the local shopping mall to get Gary's autograph). The player can choose to fight and kill Coleman as one of the game's two boss characters or simply have the book signed peacefully (after enduring a long line-up). If the book does get signed, the Dude remarks to Coleman that he really loved him in Facts of Life (a spinoff sitcom which Coleman was never in). Regardless of the Dude's actions, the police storm the building in an attempt to arrest Gary Coleman and a gunfight ensues which invariably results in Coleman's apparent demise, with or without the player's help. Later on in the game he can also be seen in the Police Station, when the player escapes from his cell he also frees everyone elseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including Coleman, who can be seen running alongside Krotchy. Coleman apparently survives as he can be seen in the Apocalypse Weekend expansion, bandaged up in the hospital (various evil Gary Coleman clones also serve as recurring enemies during Postal Dude's constant hallucinations).\n----------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n***Props***\nThe town features many cars but they are all &quot;useless exploding props&quot;, according to Dude, and cannot be driven, although they can be blown up and sent flying into the air. In addition to cats and dogs, other animals present are elephants; these animals can be shot or set on fireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or simply annoyed by the player walking into themÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½causing them to trumpet with rage and attack anyone within stomping distance. A bizarre feature is the ability to pick up cats as an inventory item. When used, the Postal Dude shoves the barrel of the currently equipped firearm into the cat's anus (cats can only be used while equipped with a shotgun or assault rifle) as a 'silencer'. Every time a shot is fired, the cat meows in apparent agony, and the gunshot is muffled. After several shots the cat will be killed and will fly from the end of the weapon. Most dogs have the ability to befriend the Dude if he feeds them a continual supply of dog biscuits or feeds them any other food (pizza, donuts, fast food). Once a canine's loyalty has been earned, the dog will attack anyone who attacks the Dude, or alternatively, anyone whom the Dude attacks. Dogs will also chase and kill cats, and play fetch with the Dude's inventory items and also severed heads. There were also going to be cows included in the game, but they were left unprogrammed. They did appear in Apocalypse Weekend and the A Week in Paradise modification.\n---------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n********************GAME ADDONS*********************\n\nShare the Pain:\nThe updated edition of the game, entitled Postal 2: Share the Pain included a multiplayer mode . The Macintosh and Linux versions of Postal 2 shipped only as Postal 2: Share the Pain. Share the Pain has since far eclipsed the original production version of Postal 2 in all markets. From 2008 RWS released the multiplayer part of the game as freeware minus the unrealed based level editor PostEd so it's still played and attracting new players.\n\nApocalypse Weekend:\nPostal 2: Apocalypse Weekend (named such because the end of Postal 2 marks the beginning of the apocalypse in Paradise) was released by Running with Scissors, Inc. on May 12, 2005 for Windows, and September 28, 2005 for the Mac and Linux versions. Apocalypse Weekend expands the reaches of Paradise with new maps and missions, set on Saturday and Sunday, adds new weapons and foes, and raises Postal 2's gore and violence to an even greater level. All normal cats are also replaced with &quot;dervish cats&quot;, which spin in a manner similar to that of Looney Tunes Tasmanian Devil, attacking any nearby character when agitated. Dervish cats can also be collected and, in addition to muffling guns, can be thrown at NPCs to attack them. While gameplay is similar to its parent Postal 2, Apocalypse Weekend is not as open-ended. The gameplay is more linear in design, with the player mostly forced to follow a certain path to complete the gameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½typical of most first-person shooter games. In addition, the player cannot play as a pacifist and is forced to kill animals and zombies in order to progress in the game. Both Postal 2: Share The Pain and Postal 2: Apocalypse Weekend were ported to Linux and Macintosh by developer Ryan C. Gordon.[1]\nThe add-on begins Saturday morning, with the Dude waking up in the hospital, his head bandaged from a near-fatal gunshot wound (while the Postal 2 ending leaves it ambiguous as to whether or not the Dude shot his wife or if his wife shot him; after he wakes up in the hospital he finds a card from his wife saying that she is leaving him, it was recently revealed on the official website [2] that the Dude shot himself due to his wife nagging him). The Dude proceeds through several missions including assignments from his former employers (RWS), encounters with zombies, and encounters with terrorists and the military. (With the exception of the zombies, it would appear the madness depicted at the end of Friday on the previous game has petered out). Periodically Dude's head wound causes him to enter a nether realm where he is attacked by Gary Coleman clones. Dude's ultimate goal is to recover his trailer and his dog. Throughout his weekend the Dude fights off hordes of zombies, rebels and the national guard until he finally faces a zombified Mike Jaret, or, in his own words, &quot;KOSHER MAD COW ZOMBIE GOD OF HELLFIRE!!!&quot;. Once the Dude destroys it he leaves Paradise in his car with his dog and his trailer while Paradise explodes due to a massive nuclear warhead he &quot;borrowed&quot; to destroy a rival video game development and publishing company whose name is obscured by black bars (When you remove the black bars in the UnrealEd, the name of the company is revealed to be &quot;Bullfish Interactive&quot;). The Dude's last words of the game are &quot;I regret nothing&quot;.\nThe expansion adds several new weapons, including a machete which can be thrown like a boomerang, serving as both a close- and long-range weapon, as well as sledgehammers and scythes which can also be thrown. Unlike the main game, Apocalypse Weekend also includes several &quot;boss monster&quot; encounters.\n\nA Week in Paradise:\nCreated for the Fudge Pack compilation, A Week in Paradise is a slightly modified version of the main game, with several new maps added (including a college), additional weaponry (including nuclear weapons), and different outfits, hats and props for non-player characters. The zombies from Apocalypse Weekend also debut earlier in this version during an optional mission. The mod also gives the option for players to play the main Postal 2 and Apocalypse Weekend as a single continuous game, hence the title.\n\nEternal Damnation:\nA fan-produced mod that RWS included in its Fudge Pack compilation. Using the basic Postal 2 engine and elements, the game features completely new maps and a horror-based storyline that puts the player into the role of an escapee from a mental asylum similar to Manhunt 2. The zombies from Apocalypse Weekend play a major role in this modification, including a brand-new zombie (exclusive to Eternal Damnation) that resembles the plastinates of Body Worlds.\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL\nLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL\nLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL\n(I'm Loling at all of the below)\n\nControversy\nUrinating on dismembered bodies in a terrorist training camp\n\nThe developers of the game countered criticism of the violence by claiming that the amount of violence is up to the playersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½they may go about their tasks without causing trouble, or they can create mayhem. Critics state that the game clearly urges people playing the game to indulge in homicidal behavior, given that Dude is often attacked by ludicrous hate groups who despise everything from books to video games. Additionally, there are long queues when Dude visits the bank, the library, Church, and elsewhere. The people of Paradise are exceptionally rude and spit insults at Dude if he bumps into them, and furthermore weapons ranging from machine guns to rocket launchers are left lying around for him to collect.\n\nGoing on the rampage (or going postal, the phrase which the game is named after) is clearly encouraged, but never necessary. While difficult, it is possible for the player to complete the game without resorting to violence or having to kill anyone; although in this case, the player will have to resort to using cunning tactics to surviveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including a greater temptation to steal and take drugs. Some missions put Dude into extremely hostile environments where he will be tempted to kill the people attacking him in order to survive, and at these moments the player will have to make a choice whether to fight or to flee. The attackers include book protesters who set the local library on fire and then attempt to murder everyone trapped inside, a band of armed robbers, and violent video game protesters who ironically begin brandishing weapons and opening fire on the Dude and the Running With Scissors (the company which makes the Postal series) staff without provocation.\n\nIn many of the scenarios presented, however, experienced players can make use of the game's version of monster infighting to actually cause police or other non-player characters to attack individuals who may be attacking the player, and thus escape from harm without inflicting any. Unlike other games that utilize the &quot;monster infighting&quot; feature (such as Doom), non-player characters do not have to be in the enemy's line-of-fire to enter &quot;infighting&quot; mode; some NPCs (particularly law enforcement and military characters) are programmed to attack anyone brandishing a weapon or firing same (an NPC fleeing in panic can also trigger an attack). In most (but not all) cases, once an enemy NPC is engaged by another NPC, he/she temporarily forgets about attacking the Postal Dude.\n\nSeveral ambient features like advertisement signs, shop names, and interiors are loaded with some dark humor, thus exposing the decadent nature of Paradise. The game also involves some obvious inside jokes. Dude actually works for Running with Scissors, the game's developers, with its offices being the scene of a protest by a group opposed to violent computer games. Some of the company employees show up in other areas too, such as Mike Jaret, who appears as the cross-dresser in the gay bar, and executive producer Vince Desiderio, who appears as himself in the game. RWS personnel are considered allies to Postal Dude and will often attack NPCs that attack the player (although they may also attack Postal Dude if he accidentally or purposely shoots at them several times in a row).\n\nSome game critics regarded Postal 2 as being a single-joke affair which clearly sets out to shock and has limited play value, but it also has quite a cult following. Postal 2 did not achieve moral panic in the sense that the Grand Theft Auto series did. While violence and sexuality were part of both games, it is used with discretion in the GTA series, while it was excessive enough in Postal 2 that it was considered tasteless and senseless. Violence aside, reviewers gave low ratings to Postal 2 for its poor production values and occasional technical flaws. Unlike the GTA games, Postal 2's content was sufficiently over the edge to preclude widespread distribution, and many North American retailers would not stock it.\n\nThe game received additional negative publicity following the September 13, 2006, Dawson College shooting incident in Montreal. Media coverage regarding the shooter, Kimveer Gill, indicated that he played violent video games. Postal 2 was cited as one of these games, although some coverage by CTV erroneously stated that the game was only available for sale in the United Kingdom.\n\nRegarding his views on the subject, Linux and Macintosh developer Ryan C. Gordon, who ported the game to those platforms, stated that he feels that the game holds a mirror to the worst aspects of modern society, saying in an interview that the game is a &quot;brilliant caricature of our mangled, disconnected, fast-food society, disguised as a collection of dirty jokes and ultraviolence.&quot;[3]\n\nMichael Simms, founder of Linux Game Publishing, also at one point commented on the matter, stating that &quot;although I wasn't a fan of the gameplay in Postal 2, I loved the message that the company was trying to put out. Because you can play Postal 2 in the most violent and graphic way, but you can also play it without hurting a single person. I don't know anyone who's played it like that, but I like that the people who made Postal are saying you can get through this game without any violence.&quot;[4]\n\nRegardless of the critical commentary received by Postal 2, the game has earned a cult following and a movie has been produced.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nControversial aspects:\n\n+++Violence and police brutality+++\n    * The option of attacking and/or killing police officers and soldiers, as well as bystanders.\n    * Decapitating people with shovels or similar weapons (katana, machete etc.) and kicking the heads about.\n    * Setting people on fire with a variety of methods, from gasoline and matches, to molotov cocktails and napalm launchers or even the kicking about of burning heads. If a kill by burning is achieved in multiplayer, the game will refer to it as a &quot;Tibetan monk experience&quot;.\n    * Stun gunning people until they cower on the ground and urinate on themselves.\n    * When Postal Dude wears the police outfit and brutalizes innocent people, the other police officers openly admit that they are corrupt. At several points in the game, police NPCs are seen attacking and killing civilians for no apparent reason. Furthermore, while they will attempt to arrest Postal Dude if he commits a crime, they will always attempt to kill any NPCs they participate in monster infighting with, usually by beating the NPC to death with their batons even if the targeted NPC has surrendered and is begging for mercy. In multiplayer, if the player beats another player to death with a Police Baton, it is noted as the killed player's &quot;Rodney King Impression&quot;\n    * Playing &quot;fetch&quot; with dogs using the severed heads of slain NPCs (it should be noted that dogs &quot;friendly&quot; to the player will also fetch any non-food items dropped or kicked around by the player).\n    * The add-ons (see above) add the ability to dismember NPCs with weapons such as chainsaws, katanas, etc., and watch them attempt to crawl away. This ability is enhanced in the A Week in Paradise mod.\n\n+++References of current and past events+++\n    * Al-Qaeda terrorists who carry out a suicide bombing of a church and a marching band (these characters all resemble Osama bin Laden and many characters in the game of Middle Eastern descent are shown to be connected in some way with the terrorists).\n    * The hunt for weapon of mass destruction in Iraq is parodied in the weapon called the &quot;Weapon of Mass Destruction&quot;, found in the Tora Bora area. It is a variation of the rocket launcher that fires chemical missiles.\n    * Anthrax-filled cow's heads used as weapons which make the victims vomit blood.\n    * A scene that bears resemblance to the Waco Siege of 1993, with a cult group being surrounded by ATF agents at &quot;the compound&quot;.\n    * Jihad, the company that makes the goat milk in Monday's chores (Which is to buy this milk with or without paying. The later will provoke the shop owner into an attempt to murder the Postal Dude).\n    * References to Columbine High School massacre and other school slaughters are present as well. The trenchcoat-shirt-glasses outfit often sported by Postal Dude references that of the &quot;Trenchcoat Mafia&quot;, a gamer clique with which the perpetrators at Columbine were erroneously affiliated. In the AWP expansion, when the player enters the arcade there is a game similar to Silent Scope called Teen Sniper. The cabinet artwork shows a child sitting on top of his school and firing at students. When the player commits suicide, relieved pedestrians say &quot;I blame Doom&quot;. This is another reference to the Columbine disaster, as the two gunmen shared an admiration for the PC game Doom.\n\n+++Stereotypes+++\n    * Homophobia in the shape of an arcade game prop called Fag Hunter. The AWP mod (included in the Fudge Pack release) expands Fag Hunter into a mini-level where the player has to kill 20 stereotyped gay NPCs (depicted as bald, unshaven men wearing pink dresses).\n    * Racial stereotypes, such as Habib, the owner of the Lucky Ganesh convenience store, who speaks with a stereotypical Indian accent similar of that of Apu from the FOX sitcom The Simpsons. Habib appears to be a Muslim, yet at the same time his store has obvious Hindu elements.\n\n+++Miscellaneous+++\n    * The use of cats as silencers for shotguns and machine guns by pushing the barrel of the gun into its rectum. This was commented on in an episode of Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit.[5]\n    * A kid's TV show mascot named Krotchy, who is essentially a giant cartoon scrotum. A talking toy with his likeness even says phrases such as &quot;Daddy said only he can touch me there!&quot; or &quot;Don't touch me! I callin' my lawyer!&quot; when used. Krotchy has a partner character named Larry the Crab, whose toy seems much less popular (indicated by the toy store being literally filled with Larry dolls and no Krotchy because Krotchy toys were sold out).\n    * Numerous jabs and insults aimed at Joe Lieberman, including a banner that reads &quot;Leiberman [sic], God sees your lies&quot;, the easiest difficulty setting is &quot;Liebermode&quot;, and in the final newspaper announcing the apocalypse on Friday, a byline that reads &quot;Lieberman blames Doom&quot;. (After a player's death or suicide, if the game is left running without restarting or reloading a saved game, NPCs standing around the body will invariably make statements such as &quot;Somebody call Lieberman&quot; and &quot;I blame Doom&quot;). Similarly, several jokes are aimed at Dave Grossman such as a video arcade named &quot;Grossman's Arcade&quot;.\n    * The game allows the player to urinate on people making them vomit in disgust.\n\nLegal status:\n    * Postal 2 became the second computer game to be banned by the Office of Film and Literature Classification of New Zealand after Manhunt.\n    * It was also banned in Australia by the OFLC due to the absence of an 18+ rating for software.\n    * In Sweden, the attorney general took the Swedish distributor of the game to court. He was prosecuted with &quot;illegal depiction of violence&quot;, a crime falling under the Swedish freedom of speech-act. The court dismissed the case on December 12, 2006.\n\nLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL\nLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL (SOUNDS LIKE FUN, RIGHT?)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHELP ME SEED MY LOW-SEEDED TORRENTS SO I CAN UPLOAD MORE AND NOT WORRY ABOUT THE OLD ONES!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDon't forget to snag a copy of my Land of the Dead torrent (you can play it online).\n\n\nI HAVE A FEW ONLINE PLAYABLE TORRENTS SO FAR:\nLand of the Dead\nSerious Sam: The First and Second Encounter\nNexuiz\nDoom Collection (all the older doom games)  NOTE: This Requires a mod to play online (skulltag), it's free, google it\nSniper Elite\nOTHERS CAN MOST LIKELY BE PLAYED VIA HAMACHI\n\n\nDOWNLOAD ALL MY TORRENTS HERE:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47443e8a072189eb4af040e65b75c1d2172cc6c1","amp;dn":"Postal+1+And+Postal+2+Share+The+Pain+%28Online+Playable%29+%28All+Mods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47443e8a072189eb4af040e65b75c1d2172cc6c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,68,62,138,7,33,137,235,74,240,64,230,91,117,193,210,23,44,198,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
