Separated from his wife, whom he loves passionately, he is torn between an unrelenting approach to solving serial killings and his attempts to rekindle his marriage. Luther is a highly charged emotional man who is not above stretching the law to solve a case or save a life. In episode one, Alice Morgan (Ruth Wilson) proves she is equally brilliant by committing the perfect murder of her parents, which challenges Luther as never before. Alice develops a strange fascination for Luther and their continued exchanges and interplay serve as a backdrop for the rest of the season. Luther's edgy police tactics make him a serious concern to his superiors, who feel that he is a threat to their reputations and that of the Police force. From the opening credits to the end of season one, &quot;Luther&quot; is a fast paced mystery presented with many plot twists and insights into the human psyche.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e851302e1201339cdcf0227b82c0e56d90d7cd21","amp;dn":"Luther+S02+%28Xvid%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e851302e1201339cdcf0227b82c0e56d90d7cd21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,81,48,46,18,1,51,156,220,240,34,123,130,192,229,109,144,215,205,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
