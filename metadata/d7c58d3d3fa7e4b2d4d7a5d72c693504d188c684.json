Disconnect from the Internet \r\n2. Run Setup (64 bit only) \r\n3. Install CONNECTION client app then the WaterCAD Software (I recommend C:Program Files (x86)Bentley as a directory for the patch to work) \r\n4. Run AS AN ADMIN (USE ADMIN RIGHTS!) Bentley.exe (Antivirus might spot it as Trojan but it's false positive). Check connect version and find WaterCAD on the list then Activate. \r\n5. Make sure WaterCAD.exe is blocked at the Firewall from connecting to the Internet \r\n\r\nThe How-to-crack above works. If the error &quot;...Access to the path ...Bentley.liclib.10.dll is denied&quot; RUN Bentley.exe AS AN ADMIN \r\nLicense is lifetime valid (or something like it). \r\nIf you like the upload and it works fine for you, don't hit and run the torrent but keep it seeded for a while. Seedboxes are most welcome.
