Reynolds brings that same deceptively effortless mastery to the shorter fictional forms, a fact that Troika, his elegant, compulsively listenable new novella, amply demonstrates.\r\n\r\nTroika tells the story of men and women confronting an enigma known as the Matryoshka, a vast alien construct whose periodic appearances have generated terror, wonder, and endless debate. During its third &quot;apparition&quot; in a remote corner of the galaxy, a trio of Russian cosmonauts approach this enigma and attempt to penetrate its mysteries. What they discover - and what they endure in the process - forms the centerpiece of an enthralling, constantly surprising narrative.\r\n\r\nTroika is at once a wholly original account of First Contact and a meditation on time, history, and the essentially fluid nature of identity itself. Suspenseful, erudite, and gracefully written, it is a significant accomplishment in its own right and a welcome addition to a remarkable body of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Wayne June\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nL: 2 hrs and 54 mins\r\nUnabridged Audiobook\r\nRelease Date:04-08-16\r\nPublisher: Subterranean Press","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bdb4ffbd6cde71b7f772f8c71ead39ccaddf55c","amp;dn":"Alastair+Reynolds+-+Troika","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bdb4ffbd6cde71b7f772f8c71ead39ccaddf55c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,219,79,251,214,205,231,27,127,119,47,140,113,234,211,156,202,221,245,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
