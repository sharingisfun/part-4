The band signed to Run For Cover Records in early 2012, releasing their EP Young States that year as well as a split with labelmates Turnover. In February of 2013, Citizen entered Studio 4 with producer Will Yip (Title Fight, Circa Survive, Daylight) to record Youth, their debut full-length. From the first note of album opener &quot;Roam The Room&quot;, the fuzzy, guitar-driven rock songs bleed emotion straight through to closer &quot;Drawn Out&quot;. Citizen have called on the ghosts of Brand New and early Nirvana, creating a sound that is familiar but immediately all its own.
