Youthful energy and the sweaty resilience of desperate and smitten lovers emanates as the KnifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pass this onÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ uninhibitedly croons Ã¢â‚¬ËœIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m in love with your brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to thick reverberations. A nod to best-selling French new wave band Indochine deepens the pulsating trend of electronic dance music and the erotic routine of scouting potential loves.\n\nAlthough Bach and WagnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pieces seem to comprise a romantic and uplifting sense, I would argue it is the looming despair and sadness that brings a sense of reality about unrequited love to the movie. And perhaps an idea of a lasting love but one that is left to yearn and pine for, not revel and enjoy. It is this sense of emotion that brings depth to DolanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s films; he is able to write comically and add light to very human emotions, but he is still seemingly aware of their ultimate and devastating impact.\n\n-The inclusion of DalidaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cover of Ã¢â‚¬ËœBang BangÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬â€ever present in the trailerÃ¢â‚¬â€seems to encompass a few themes within the film. There is a cheesiness quality to the song (maybe from incessant covers and use), sassiness and an element of regret and finality. This French addition is good separately and in the film, it complements the cheekiness that Dolan seems to play with.\n\n Undoubtedly, the soundtrack is a side note to waves of positive reviews surfacing about this film, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ingenuity and brilliance. This soundtrack is merely the icing of another story of lust and heartbreak atop the plentiful bounds of copious emotions.\n\nTrack Listing\nDalida- Bang Bang\nHouse of Pain- Jump Around\nThe Knife- Pass this on\nSting- Every Breath You Take\nFever Ray- Keep the Streets Empty for Me\nIndochine- 3ÃƒÂ¨me Sexe\nComet Gain- Love Without Lies\nBach- Suite No.1\nBach- Suite No.3\nWagner- Parsifal: Prelude to act 1\nIndochine -3ÃƒÂ¨me sexe \nFrance Gall -Cet Air-LÃƒÂ¡\nThe police- Every Breath you Take\nRenÃƒÂ©e Martel- Viens changer ma vie\nVive la Fete- Exactement\nComet Grain- Love without lies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83fa54d1b7d90a35449e3f04ee3d8130f7ba05fe","amp;dn":"Original+soundtrack+Les+Amours+Imaginaires-+Xavier+Dolan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83fa54d1b7d90a35449e3f04ee3d8130f7ba05fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,250,84,209,183,217,10,53,68,158,63,4,238,61,129,48,247,186,5,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
