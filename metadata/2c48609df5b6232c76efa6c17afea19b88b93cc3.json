Most longtime BublÃƒÂ© fans will have a sense of what to expect here and, in that sense, should be quite pleased with the album. As with previous BublÃƒÂ© releases, To Be Loved finds the vocalist tackling a handful of American Popular Song standards and some more contemporary pop covers. This time around, BublÃƒÂ© even peppers the album with a few very vintage '60s soul-sounding numbers. To these ends, BublÃƒÂ© kicks things off with a brightly swinging take on &quot;You Make Me Feel So Young,&quot; turns in a neo-soul version of the Bee Gees &quot;To Love Somebody,&quot; and digs deep into Smokey Robinson's &quot;Who's Lovin' You.&quot; Also adding flavor here are a few guest appearances including duets with actress Reese Witherspoon, Bryan Adams, and the Puppini Sisters. As with BublÃƒÂ©'s last few albums, he gets some co-writing credits, with songs like the sunshine pop-sounding, 'It's a Beautiful Day,&quot; and the atmospheric orchestral ballad, &quot;I Got It Easy,&quot; registering as two of his best originals. Ultimately, To Be Loved isn't just a perfect showcase for BublÃƒÂ©'s voice, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also one of his most diverse and enjoyable albums. \n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.93% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tReprise\nCatalog:\t\t9362494497\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.You Make Me Feel So Young\n02.It's A Beautiful Day\n03.To Love Somebody\n04.Who's Lovin' You\n05.Something Stupid (Feat.
