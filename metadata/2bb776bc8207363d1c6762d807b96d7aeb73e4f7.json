They combine confrontational ideologies with deliberate misinformation to produce a brutal analysis on thought provocative punk. &quot;Ironically, their fast and sloppy early 80&amp;#039;s hardcore is a million times more musical and ferocious than 99% of professional myspace-era mosh bands, and their fans&amp;#039; post-show cuts and bruises remind us that this shit might have the potential to still be dangerous&quot; - Vice. For fans of The Wipers, Ramones, The Who, Negative Approach, Pink Floyd.\n\n\n\n192kbps mp3s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bb776bc8207363d1c6762d807b96d7aeb73e4f7","amp;dn":"Fucked+Up+-+Hidden+World+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bb776bc8207363d1c6762d807b96d7aeb73e4f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,183,118,188,130,7,54,61,28,103,98,216,7,185,109,122,235,115,228,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
