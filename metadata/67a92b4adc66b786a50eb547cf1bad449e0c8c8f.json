To understand how a noise reduction program works, it is important to understand noise. Digital cameras generate noise as do scanners because of the CCD. There are two types of noise: luminance (contrast noise) and chroma (color noise). Luminance noise looks similar to film grain. When reduced it can lead to blurry details. Chroma noise shows up as blotchy discolored areas or speckles of unwanted colors. What causes this noise? In digital cameras high ISO speeds or very low light levels will produce noise so will severely underexposed images.\n\nNik plug-ins share a basic uniformity of interface and type of controls. This lessens the learning curve a lot although it doesn't eliminate it when using the different programs. I will be treating each of my reviews on Nik Software plug-ins individually so there probably will be some repetition of features. One of the basic feature is U PointÃ‚Â® Technology which relies on Control Points. Control Points affect an area that you establish. In Dfine 2.0 you can set up areas that will be affected by the noise settings you choose. These settings are not global but similar to creating a selective area with a lasso tool. This will be discussed in detail later in the review. If desired, these plug-ins have the ability to be used as Smart Filters.\n\nWorking with CS6.\n\nInfo:\n\n- Disconnect net.\n- Install.\n- Open PS, select image, go to plugin and activate.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/25117570748222789708.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/25117570748222789708.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67a92b4adc66b786a50eb547cf1bad449e0c8c8f","amp;dn":"Nik+Software+-+Dfine+2.107+%5BENG%5D%5BSerial%5D%5BPhotoshop+Plugin%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67a92b4adc66b786a50eb547cf1bad449e0c8c8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,169,43,74,220,102,183,134,165,14,181,71,207,27,173,68,158,12,140,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
