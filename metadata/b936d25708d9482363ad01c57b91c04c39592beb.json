To drill down to a folder, just click on a segment. To bubble up, click in the center. Move the mouse over the diagram and see the name and path of each file, and enclosed files (if any). Hit Space to quickly preview file content, without launching another application. In this way, walk around your disk and drag-and-drop all unneeded files into the â€œcollectorâ€. Expand the collector to check its contents. When done, clean it up with a single click.\r\n\r\nWhat's new in version 2.0:\r\n- Fixed feedback form error on OS X El Capitan.\r\n- Fixed navigation gestures on OS X El Capitan.\r\n\r\nMADE IN UKRAINE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b936d25708d9482363ad01c57b91c04c39592beb","amp;dn":"DaisyDisk+4.0.2+%5BMAC+OS+X%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b936d25708d9482363ad01c57b91c04c39592beb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,54,210,87,8,217,72,35,99,173,1,197,123,145,192,76,57,89,43,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
