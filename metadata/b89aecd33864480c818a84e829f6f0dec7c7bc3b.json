ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the USAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fifth-busiest airport, largest by land area and the 10th-busiest in the world.\n\nThe airport features custom made runways, terminal buildings rendered to 10cm per pixel scale, an interactive docking system to park you right on your mark, taxiways with highly realistic concrete textures, full airport taxiway and runway signage, 3D approach lighting and full ILS navigation. There are hundreds of airport vehicles, aircraft can be found parked at custom textured parking positions, all hangers, cargo and airport auxiliary buildings are modelled, there is even a complete and secure perimeter fence with security checkpoints and emergency vehicle access points - all under the steady gaze of intermittently placed security cameras!\n\nIn addition to all of this, KDEN looks stunning after dark with beautifully lit buildings and parking areas.
