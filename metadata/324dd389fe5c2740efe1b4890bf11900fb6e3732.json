If so, let me know rather than just whining and maybe gimme a few pointers, but they seem to sound okay.\n\nFiles have been split on intra track silences by hand, so again they could be a bit hit and miss but only in the sense of the length of the leading/trailing blank I don't think I cut any actual sound.\n\nThose files were then subsequently renamed and tagged with MusicBrainz-picard-freeworld.\n\nDisk 1 is widely available through a TPB search but I could only find requests for this though it's possible I didn't look hard enough. I also don't do this much so expect it to go wrong and account for the fact that my ISP caps me on-peak, so it may be sporadic if it works at all.\n\n\nI'll shut up now","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:324dd389fe5c2740efe1b4890bf11900fb6e3732","amp;dn":"REM-The+Best+Of%3AIn+Time+1988-2003-Bonus+Disc+ONLY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"324dd389fe5c2740efe1b4890bf11900fb6e3732","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,77,211,137,254,92,39,64,239,225,180,137,11,241,25,0,251,110,55,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
