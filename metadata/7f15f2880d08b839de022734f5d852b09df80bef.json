Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy led the field but many more major Spaghetti Westerns were made by important directors, including Sergio Corbucci's Navajo Joe, Carlo Lizzanis The Hills Run Red, Duccio Tessaris A Pistol for Ringo. Combining analysis, information and lively anecdotes, this popular guide explores all of these films through the biographies and filmographies of key personnel, stories of the films' making, their locations and sets, sources, musical scores, detailed cast information and many illustrations, including original posters and stills.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f15f2880d08b839de022734f5d852b09df80bef","amp;dn":"Once+Upon+a+Time+in+the+Italian+West+-+A+Filmgoers+Guide+to+Spag","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f15f2880d08b839de022734f5d852b09df80bef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,21,242,136,13,8,184,57,222,2,39,52,245,216,82,176,157,248,11,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
