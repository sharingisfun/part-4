Their meteoric rise began in 2005, when the teenagers fielded offers from major labels and drew a sold-out crowd to the London Astoria, using little more than a self-released EP as bait. Several months later, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not became the fastest-selling debut album in British history, entrenching Arctic Monkeys in the same circle as multi-platinum acts like Oasis and Blur.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7f340c89a6f138c158ef07949b917f35cf2b038","amp;dn":"Arctic+Monkeys+-+AM+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D+BriBerY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7f340c89a6f138c158ef07949b917f35cf2b038","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,243,64,200,154,111,19,140,21,142,240,121,73,185,23,243,92,242,176,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
