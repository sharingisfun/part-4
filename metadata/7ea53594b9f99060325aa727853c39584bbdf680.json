Zorn was described by Down Beat as &quot;one of our most important composers&quot;.\n\nZorn established himself within the New York City downtown music movement in the mid-1970s performing with musicians across the sonic spectrum and developing experimental methods of composing new music. After releasing albums on several independent US and European labels, Zorn signed with Elektra Nonesuch and received wide acclaim with the release of The Big Gundown, an album reworking the compositions of Ennio Morricone. \nHe attracted further attention worldwide with the release of Spillane in 1987, and Naked City in 1989. \nAfter spending almost a decade travelling between Japan and the US he made New York his permanent base and established his own record label, Tzadik, in the mid-1990s.\n\n John Zorn\n\nAlbum - The True Discoveries Of Witches And Demons\n\nYear - 2015\nGenre - Avant-Garde / Jazz / Rock / Experimental\n\nWeb -\nCountry - USA\nQuality - VBR V0\n\nTRACKLIST\n01.
