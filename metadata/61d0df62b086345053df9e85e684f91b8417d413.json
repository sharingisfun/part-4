Salvatore &quot;Sonny&quot; Bono (born February 16, 1935) started out at Los Angeles-based Specialty Records as a songwriter in the late '50s, responsible for &quot;Koko Joe&quot; by Don &amp; Dewey and &quot;She Said Yeah&quot; for Larry Williams, which was later covered by the Rolling Stones and the Righteous Brothers. Bono became a protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ© of Phil Spector, managing to write a handful of successful songs, most notably &quot;Needles and Pins&quot; in collaboration with his protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ© Jack Nitzsche, which became a success for Jackie DeShannon and a huge international hit for the Searchers. In 1964, while working sessions with Phil Spector, he met an 18-year-old would-be singer named Cherilyn Lapierre (born May 20, 1946), and the two were later married. They formed a professional duet, initially as Caesar &amp; Cleo for Vault Records and later Reprise, but it was only after they were signed to Atlantic Records as Sonny &amp; Cher that success came their way. The couple embarked on parallel careers, with Cher later signed to Liberty/Imperial Records as a solo act. \n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.86% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tAtlantic/ATCO\nCatalogue #\t\t7567-91796-2\t\t\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Baby Don't Go\n02.Just You\n03.Sing C'est La Vie\n04.I Got You Babe\n05.Why Don't They Let Us Fall In Love\n06.Laugh At Me\n07.But You're Mine\n08.The Revolution Kind\n09.What Now My Love\n10.Have I Stayed Too Long\n11.Leave Me Be\n12.Little Man\n13.Living For You\n14.Love Don't Come\n15.The Beat Goes On\n16.Beautiful Story\n17.It's The Little Things\n18.My Best Friend's Girl Is Out Of Sight\n19.Good Combination\n20.I Got You Babe\n21.Hello\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61d0df62b086345053df9e85e684f91b8417d413","amp;dn":"Sonny+And+Cher+-+Best+Of+The+Beat+Goes+On++%281991%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61d0df62b086345053df9e85e684f91b8417d413","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,208,223,98,176,134,52,80,83,223,158,133,230,132,249,27,132,23,212,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
