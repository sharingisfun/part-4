Humphrey Bogart, Irene Manning, Richard Travis\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034513/\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Big Shot is a noir crime drama starring Humphrey Bogart as a crime boss and Irene Manning as the woman he falls in love with. This was the last film in which Bogart, who had finally reached stardom with High Sierra and The Maltese Falcon, would portray a gangster. With its dark atmosphere, low camera angles, nightmarish voice montages, anti-hero protagonists and ultra-violent shootouts and car chases, the story is almost a straight-up noir thriller. One of Bogart's lesser-known works, it was released on DVD for the first time by Warner in 2015.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 640x480, 23.976 fps, 1844 Kbps, 01h22m06s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 384 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, optional subtitles Portuguese, Russian, Spanish\r\n \nhttps://extraimago.com/images/2016/10/08/8d3ee74df98860bc65da829ef8cc9748.jpg \nhttps://extraimago.com/images/2016/10/08/988d82bb27381f27e088d0724612b0d9.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:025ef6607b0dbb3c1cf72b065f50c7cb82cb5d73","amp;dn":"The+Big+Shot+%5B1942+-+USA%5D+Humphrey+Bogart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"025ef6607b0dbb3c1cf72b065f50c7cb82cb5d73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,94,246,96,123,13,187,60,28,247,43,6,95,80,199,203,130,203,93,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
