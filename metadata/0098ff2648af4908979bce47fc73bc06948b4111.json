You need to speak the language from day one.\n\nNo years of studying grammar, no expensive and complicated software, no ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmagic pillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to master a language while you sleep, you just need to speak it. Speak it regularly, speak it confidently, and speak it immediately. The more you speak, the quicker you will improve.\n\nEven though this may be obvious, how you actually speak a language that you have just started to learn seems almost impossible to many people. So theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll wait until they are ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œreadyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. That wait may be years, or they may simply never even try.\n\nBut itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not actually that hard! ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what the Language Hacking Guide is about.\n\nThe social/confidence context of a language ignored in academic courses\nIt sounds so obvious, but most courses skip the most crucial aspects of communication and focus on nothing more than the content, as if knowing the grammar and a list of random words will magically have you speaking fluently.\n\nHiding away in your room with an audio course is never going to get you to speak the language. Only practice can do that. I have met thousands of people who have been disappointed by such courses that completely ignore these crucial questions, all of which are the focus of the Language Hacking Guide and are discussed and explained in detail:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢How to practise a language every day for free with natives even if you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t travel to their country. (p. 164)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢How to easily express all youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve learned even if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re a shy introverted person like so many other beginning language learners. (p. 127)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢How to make sure that natives wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t feel frustrated at your ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfeebleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ attempts to speak their language. (p. 117)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢When you will be ready to speak. (p. 55)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢What to do if you suddenly have to move to your spouseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s country or for work reasons, or have an upcoming trip and donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have the time to invest months into input-based learning. (p.158)\nAnd there are a bunch of other questions more relevant to the human aspect of speaking a language that you can never get the answer to in grammar/vocabulary courses. I have learned all of these the hard way through years of field testing in immersion environments. Why should you have to go through the same struggle? All the information in the Guide has been compiled to help best guide people towards fluency in their target language as quickly as possible\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0098ff2648af4908979bce47fc73bc06948b4111","amp;dn":"Language+Hacking+Guide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0098ff2648af4908979bce47fc73bc06948b4111","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,152,255,38,72,175,73,8,151,155,206,71,252,115,188,6,148,139,65,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
