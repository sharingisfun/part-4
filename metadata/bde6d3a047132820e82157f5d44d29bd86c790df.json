Some songs evoke a mod/psych/garage-rock vibe, both in production aesthetic and lyrical content, along with 1960s French-pop, in the vein of Francoise Hardy. Some of their tracks are playful, low-fi versions of pop, rock and soul songs that employ the use of analogue recording equipment and reverberation. In that vein, they made a pop version of Salt-N-Pepa's electro rap hit &quot;Push It&quot;.\n\n6 albums\n\n1997 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Monokini\n1998 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Juke-Box Alarm\n1999 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· My Melody\n2001 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Musique Automatique\n2004 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Do the Bambi!\n2005 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Discotheque\n\n\nEnjoy + Seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bde6d3a047132820e82157f5d44d29bd86c790df","amp;dn":"Stereo+Total+%286+Albums%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bde6d3a047132820e82157f5d44d29bd86c790df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,230,211,160,71,19,40,32,232,33,87,245,212,77,41,189,134,199,144,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
