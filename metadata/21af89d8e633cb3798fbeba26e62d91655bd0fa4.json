Mikis Theodorakis - Phaedra (O.S.T.)\n\nThe soundtrack of the film &quot;Phaedra&quot;, filmed in 1962 by the director Jules Dassin and actors Melina Mercouri and Anthony Perkins.\nAs the composer says, all started with the song &quot;Agapi Mou (my Love)&quot; because, in their first contact on the music of the film, Melina asked him to write &quot;the most erotic and passionate love song.&quot;\n\n\n01.

Mikis Theodorakis - Z (O.S.T.)\n\nDirected by Costa Gavras in1969\nWritten by Gavras &amp; Jorge Semprun from the eponymous novel by Vassilis Vassilikos.\nCast: Yves Montand, Jean-Louis Trintignant, Jacques Perrin, Irene Papas...\n\nThe most popular and well known from the soundtrack bearing the signature of Mikis Theodorakis.\nIn 1963, Grigorios Lambrakis, MD, a popular leftist Member of the Greek Parliament, was assassinated in Thesssaloniki by goons employed by the extreme Right. Eventually the right-wing establishment fell and a precarious democracy was established, only to lead to a coup on 21 April 1967, by a military junta. The colonels' dictatorship lasted for 7 years. \nThe title comes from a combination of the sound of the Greek letter Z , which is pronounced approximately like &quot;Long Live&quot; , and the English sound of Z, which means in Greek, &quot; he lives, he is alive&quot; . \nSuch shouts were uttered by the record crowd which attended Lambrakis' funeral in Athens. (Some people think that Z symbolizes the end, but the last letter of the Greek alphabet is Omega.) \nWhen the movie came out, the Junta was already in place. The film was made with French money. It could not, of course, be shot in Greece, so Algeria was used as a substitute.\n\nThe music is not written especially for the film.\nAt that time the Greek composer was in exile,so the director and the French curator for the music chose patterns of the projects &quot;Mauthausen&quot; and &quot;One Homer&quot;, which worked on the orchestration.\nThe choice proved very successful.\n\n\n\n01.
