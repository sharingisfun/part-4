FÃƒÂ¶rsta gÃƒÂ¥ngen jag laddar upp en torrent &amp;amp; nÃƒÂ¥got gick tydligen snett!)\n\nReleased May 2003 on Twisted Records. Written and produced by OTT. Fans of early Banco-de-Gaia will no doubt find comfort in the spaced out global dub-fest that is 'Blumenkraft'; atmospheric and spacey mixes with funky delicious grooves and, in places, upbeat danceable beats. This is more than dub! \n     \n1 Jack's Cheese and Bread Snack 12:52\n2 Somersettler 07:31\n3 Splitting An Atom 07:21\n4 Escape From Tulse Hell 07:12\n5 Cley Hill 07:32\n6 Billy The Kid Strikes Back 07:13\n7 A Load Up At Nunney Catch 07:18\n8 Spannered In Pilton 07:07\n9 Smoked Glass and Chrome 08:36\n\nWith a wealth of production and recording experience under his belt, including Sinead OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Connor, The Orb and Brian Eno, OTT turned his editing skills to Sphongle with Simon Posford (aka Hallucinogen). OTT then produced a remix album of Hallucinogens tracks titled 'Hallucinogen in Dub', which was followed by his debut album 'Blumenkraft' on Twisted Records in 2003. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5366b5449a52ec7d089fdd7e318712741293ddb0","amp;dn":"OTT+-+BLUMENKRAFT+SpaceTrance+in+DUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5366b5449a52ec7d089fdd7e318712741293ddb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,102,181,68,154,82,236,125,8,159,221,126,49,135,18,116,18,147,221,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
