These are worlds undreamt-of by any other mind. Only David Foster Wallace could convey a father's desperate loneliness by way of his son's daydreaming through a teacher's homicidal breakdown (&quot;The Soul Is Not a Smithy&quot;). Or could explore the deepest and most hilarious aspects of creativity by delineating the office politics surrounding a magazine profile of an artist who produces miniature sculptures in an anatomically inconceivable way (&quot;The Suffering Channel&quot;). Or capture the ache of love's breakdown in the painfully polite apologies of a man who believes his wife is hallucinating the sound of his snoring (&quot;Oblivion&quot;).\r\n\r\nEach of these stories is a complete world, as fully imagined as most entire novels, at once preposterously surreal and painfully immediate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Robert Petkoff\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f89d8f6937d0c9e37fa2d896fbfd098fa2ebb68","amp;dn":"David+Foster+Wallace+-+Oblivion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f89d8f6937d0c9e37fa2d896fbfd098fa2ebb68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,137,216,246,147,125,12,158,55,250,45,137,111,191,208,152,250,46,187,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
