A murdered actress. A killer case for NYPD Red. In a city where crime never sleeps, NYPD Red is the elite task force called in only when a case involves the rich, famous, and connected. Detective Zach Jordan and his partner, Kylie MacDonald--the woman who broke his heart at the police academy--are the best of the best, brilliant and tireless investigators who will stop at nothing to catch a criminal, even if it means antagonizing the same high-flying citizens they're supposed to be helping. \r\n\r\nWhen a glitzy movie premiere is the scene of a shocking murder and high-stakes robbery, NYPD Red gets the call. Traversing the city's highs and lows, from celebrity penthouses to the depths of Manhattan's criminal underworld, Zach and Kylie have to find a cold-blooded killer--before he strikes again. \r\n\r\nNYPD Red 4 is the next sensational thriller by James Patterson, the #1 bestselling crime writer of all time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac771fa18c6abcab2256e006a5a91e13b4d7d0b3","amp;dn":"NYPD+RED+4+-+James+Patterson+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac771fa18c6abcab2256e006a5a91e13b4d7d0b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,119,31,161,140,106,188,171,34,86,224,6,165,169,30,19,180,215,208,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
