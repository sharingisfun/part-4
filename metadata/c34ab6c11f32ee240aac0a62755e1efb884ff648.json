The Wailers approached producer Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry in August 1970 to record an entire album, and the sessions took place at Randy's Studio 17 in Kingston, Jamaica, until November. First issued in the UK by Trojan Records in December 1970, the album has since been re-released several times on several different labels. Perry's production is sparse and haunting, only featuring guitar, bass, drums, electronic organs, and vocals with no horns or other embellishments.\n\no. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Soul Rebel&quot;   \tBob Marley \t3:19\n2. \t&quot;Try Me&quot;   \tMarley \t2:45\n3. \t&quot;It's Alright&quot;   \tMarley \t2:34\n4. \t&quot;No Sympathy&quot;   \tPeter Tosh \t2:13\n5. \t&quot;My Cup&quot;   \tJames Brown \t3:34\n6. \t&quot;Soul Almighty&quot;   \tBob Marley \t2:42\nSide two \t\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength \t\n7. \t&quot;Rebel's Hop&quot;   \tCurtis Mayfield, Norman Whitfield, Barrett Strong, Marley \t2:38\n8. \t&quot;Corner Stone&quot;   \tMarley \t2:28\n9. \t&quot;400 Years&quot;   \tTosh \t2:33\n10. \t&quot;No Water&quot;   \tMarley \t2:08\n11. \t&quot;Reaction&quot;   \tMarley \t2:41\n12. \t&quot;My Sympathy&quot;   \tMarley \t2:41\nJust a few good seeders to keep it alive thats all.........\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c34ab6c11f32ee240aac0a62755e1efb884ff648","amp;dn":"Bob+Marley+-+Soul+Rebel++mp3++320k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c34ab6c11f32ee240aac0a62755e1efb884ff648","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,74,182,193,31,50,238,36,10,172,10,98,117,94,30,251,136,79,246,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
