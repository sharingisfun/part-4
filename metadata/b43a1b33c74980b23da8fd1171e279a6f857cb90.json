Designed throughout to help you master key concepts and improve your problem-solving skills, CHEMISTRY, Seventh Edition includes a running margin glossary, end-of-chapter in-text mini study guides, a focus on &quot;how to&quot; skills, and more in-chapter examples and problems than any text on the market. To help you understand reaction mechanisms, the authors offset them in a stepwise fashion and emphasize similarities between related mechanisms using just four different characteristics: breaking a bond, making a new bond, adding a proton, and taking a proton away. Thoroughly updated throughout, the book offers numerous biological examples for premed students, unique roadmap problems, a wide range of in-text learning tools, and integration with an online homework and tutorial system, which now includes an interactive multimedia eBook. \n\nAbout the Authors\nWilliam H. Brown is emeritus professor of chemistry at Beloit College, where he was twice named Teacher of the Year. His teaching responsibilities include organic chemistry, advanced organic chemistry, and, more recently, special topics in pharmacology and drug synthesis. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia University under the direction of Gilbert Stork and did postdoctoral work at California Institute of Technology and the University of Arizona. He is a coauthor on INTRODUCTION TO GENERAL, ORGANIC AND BIOCHEMISTRY\nBrent L. Iverson received his Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1982 and currently teaches at University of Texas, Austin. He is a distinguished teacher and respected researcher. Iverson's research group has developed methods for recombinant antibody or enzyme cloning and has directed its evolution. In collaboration with the Georgiou group, he pioneered a novel E. coli surface expression/FACS selection technology that has allowed the group to enhance antibody affinity.\nEric Anslyn is the Norman Hackerman Professor of Chemistry at The University of Texas at Austin. Highly respected in organic chemistry, he earned his Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology and has won numerous teaching awards. Anslyn's research focuses on the cutting-edge area of bioorganic chemistry.\nChristopher S. Foote received his B.S. in 1957 from Yale University and his Ph.D. in 1962 from Harvard University. His scholarly credits include Sloan Fellow 1965-1967; Guggenheim Fellow 1967-1968; ACS Baekland Award, 1975; ACS Cope Scholar, 1994; Southern California Section ACS Tolman Medal, 1996; President, American Society for Photobiology, 1988-1989; and Senior Editor, ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH. He was Professor of Chemistry at UCLA. \n\nBRIEF CONTENTS\n1. Covalent Bonding and Shapes of Molecules / 1\n2. Alkanes and Cycloalkanes / 65\n3. Stereoisomerism and Chirality / 117\n4.
