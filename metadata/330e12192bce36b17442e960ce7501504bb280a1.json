Detentions. Suspensions. Expulsions. These are the established tools of school discipline for kids who don't abide by school rules, have a hard time getting along with other kids, don't seem to respect authority, don't seem interested in learning, and are disrupting the learning of their classmates. But there's a big problem with these strategies: They are ineffective for most of the students to whom they are applied. \n\nIt's time for a change in course. \n\nHere, Dr. Ross W. Greene presents an enlightened, clear-cut, and practical alternative. Relying on research from the neurosciences, Dr. Greene offers a new conceptual framework for understanding the difficulties of kids with behavioral challenges and explains why traditional discipline isn't effective at addressing these difficulties. Emphasizing the revolutionarily simple and positive notion that kids do well if they can, he persuasively argues that kids with behavioral challenges are not attention-seeking, manipulative, limit-testing, coercive, or unmotivated, but that they lack the skills to behave adaptively. And when adults recognize the true factors underlying difficult behavior and teach kids the skills in increments they can handle, the results are astounding: The kids overcome their obstacles; the frustration of teachers, parents, and classmates diminishes; and the well-being and learning of all students are enhanced. \n\nIn Lost at School, Dr. Greene describes how his road-tested, evidence-based approach -- called Collaborative Problem Solving -- can help challenging kids at school. \n\nHis lively, compelling narrative includes: \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ tools to identify the triggers and lagging skills underlying challenging behavior. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ explicit guidance on how to radically improve interactions with challenging kids -- along with many examples showing how it's done. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ dialogues, Q &amp; A's, and the story, which runs through the book, of one child and his teachers, parents, and school. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ practical guidance for successful planning and collaboration among teachers, parents, administrations, and kids. \n\nBacked by years of experience and research, and written with a powerful sense of hope and achievable change, Lost at School gives teachers and parents the realistic strategies and information to impact the classroom experience of every challenging kid.\n\nBiography\nDr. Ross Greene is the originator of the Collaborative Problem Solving approach (now called Collaborative &amp; Proactive Solutions {CPS}), a model providing a compassionate, research-based understanding of behavioral challenges and a proactive, non-punitive, non-adversarial approach for reducing challenging behavior, improving communication, and repairing relationships. The CPS model -- which emphasizes solving problems collaboratively with children -- was initially described in his first book, The Explosive Child (now in a revised and completely updated fourth edition, and also recently published in Spanish as &quot;El Nino Explosivo&quot; and available fromThe model was also described in Dr. Greene's most recent work, Lost at School. \n\nDr. Greene is founding director of a non-profit organization, Lives in the Balance (www.livesinthebalance.org), which provides free, web-based resources on his approach and advocates on behalf of behaviorally challenging kids and their parents, teachers, and other caregivers. He is also Associate Clinical Professor at Harvard Medical School, on the professional staff at The Cambridge Hospital in Boston, Senior Lecturer in the school psychology program in the Department of Education at Tufts University, and adjunct Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology at Virginia Tech. Dr. Greene consults extensively to families, schools, inpatient psychiatry units, and residential and juvenile detention facilities, and lectures widely throughout the world (visit www.cpsconnection.com for a complete listing of learning and training options). Dr. Greene has been featured in a wide range of media, including The Oprah Show, Good Morning America, The Morning Show, and National Public Radio. He lives in Portland, Maine with his wife and two kids.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:330e12192bce36b17442e960ce7501504bb280a1","amp;dn":"Lost+At+School+-+Why+Our+Kids+With+Behavioral+Challenges+Are+Fal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"330e12192bce36b17442e960ce7501504bb280a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,14,18,25,43,206,54,177,116,66,233,96,206,117,1,80,75,178,128,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
