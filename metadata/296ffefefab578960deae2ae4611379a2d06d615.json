The few who achieve success do so because they have shed the blood, sweat, and tears necessary to master the elaborate art and craft of screenwriting. This volume navigates a relatively painless path through the screenwriting labyrinth and offers an easy to digest step-by-step guide to writing a script from inception to completion. Areas addressed include research and development; genre; story and plot; audience; character; dialogue; and drafts. A glossary of commonly used jargon to further demystify the process is also included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:296ffefefab578960deae2ae4611379a2d06d615","amp;dn":"Writing+a+Screenplay+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"296ffefefab578960deae2ae4611379a2d06d615","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,111,254,254,250,181,120,150,13,234,226,174,70,17,55,154,45,6,214,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
