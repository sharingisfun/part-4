Glen Morgan &amp; James Wong continued their roles as Co-Executive Producers, though they began to write less for the series (their final credit is series five). This season also marked the first appearance of John Shiban, who became an Executive Producer in Season 9 as a Story Editor - who wrote a few episodes - and Frank Spotnitz moved over from Story Editing to Production, becoming a Producer (he would gain Executive Producer honors in Season 6). Howard Gordon, a major writer in the first two series always writing with Alex Gansa (and in one case Carter himself), after writing Sleepless in season 2, continued writing solo with the episode: &quot;D.P.O.&quot;, featuring the acting talent of a young Jack Black and Giovanni Ribisi, which often appears on his list of favorite episodes. Also Vince Gilligan became more involved after writing &quot;Soft Light&quot; for the previous season, and gaining a Co-Producer credit.\n\nSeason 3 also marks the end of the most ambitious story in the series alien Myth-Arc with &quot;The Blessing Way&quot; and &quot;Paper Clip&quot;, marking the first three-parter, following on from &quot;Anasazi&quot; at the end of the second season. All three episodes were written by Carter.\nSEASON 3\n1 &quot;The Blessing Way\n2 &quot;Paper Clip\n3 &quot;D.P.O.\n4 &quot;Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose\n5 &quot;The List\n6 &quot;2Shy\n7 &quot;The Walk\n8 &quot;Oubliette\n9 &quot;Nisei\n10 &quot;731\n11 &quot;Revelations\n12 &quot;War of the Coprophages\n13 &quot;Syzygy\n14 &quot;Grotesque\n15 &quot;Piper Maru\n16 &quot;Apocrypha\n17 &quot;Pusher\n18 &quot;Teso Dos Bichos\n19 &quot;Hell Money\n20 &quot;Jose Chung's From Outer Space\n21 &quot;Avatar\n22 &quot;Quagmire\n23 &quot;Wetwired\n24 &quot;Talitha Cumi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c96f497f30b62dfe77a98ce2e1931bd34c258c75","amp;dn":"X-Files+Season+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c96f497f30b62dfe77a98ce2e1931bd34c258c75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,111,73,127,48,182,45,254,119,169,140,226,225,147,27,211,76,37,140,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
