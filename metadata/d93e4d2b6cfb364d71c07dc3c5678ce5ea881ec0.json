Drawing from over 50,000 interviews with entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, private equity investors, private Chinese companies, and multinationals, this book describes how Chinese firms are increasingly focused on innovation rather than copying what worked in America and how consumers are evolving with their hopes, dreams and aspirations. China's growth model of the last three decades is becoming increasingly ineffective, as relying on heavy investment and exports is becoming less and less feasible. Fifty percent of China's growth in 2013 stemmed from consumption, the government is establishing a Free Trade zone in Shanghai and ending the dominance of state-owned enterprises. This book provides a roadmap for companies and investors looking to navigate these changes and capture emerging trends, with deep insight and practical guidance on what innovation looks like in the new China.\n\n***Survey the development of innovation taking place in China's economy, from an insider's perspective\n***Consider the changes that must take place to shore up the broken growth model\n***Examine the consumer trends emerging in the midst of rapid market evolution\n***Understand how China's rise will impact its neighbors like Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Cambodia\n\nChina's dramatic shift toward consumption presents a tremendous opportunity for foreign business, but traditional tactics are outdated at best, financially fatal at worst, as local competitors focus on innovation and move up the value chain and as consumers look for new brands and categories to spend money on. New strategies are needed to keep pace with the changing regulatory and consumer environments, and &quot;business as usual&quot; won't get very far. The End of Copycat China is the business guide to this emerging market, with expert guidance from the inside.\n\nFrom the Inside Flap\nPublic opinion about the Chinese economy has failed to keep up with reality since China launched its economic reforms in 1978. In his previous book, The End of Cheap China, Shaun Rein made waves by revealing the white-collar dreams of the Chinese populace. Now, with The End of Copycat China, Rein takes on the topics of innovation and individualism, showing usÃ¢â‚¬â€yet againÃ¢â‚¬â€that everything we thought we knew about China is wrong.\n\nOf course, our misconceptions aren't entirely without foundation. In The End of Copycat China, Shaun Rein makes the case that much of China's early growth was based on heavy investments and export, driven by a whatever-it-takes mentality of adopting western business models. Those of us who have plans to continue doing business in China on this assumption are in for a big wake-up call. Through over 50,000 surveys, as well as interviews with Chinese consumers, executives, billionaires, and top innovators, the author of this book shows us that the new generations in China have begun to crave authenticity and a Chinese economy that is uniquely their own.\n\nIt might be difficult to digest some of the truths that The End of Copycat China uncovers. For example, in many areas, there is no longer any such thing as the China cost advantage. Western companies like NestlÃƒÂ©, Adidas, and Hewlett-Packard already learned this lesson the hard way. If we want to avoid losing ground in China in the coming years and decades, we need to understand Chinese market segments in a way that we never have before. Thankfully, The End of Copycat China provides the micro- and macro-level perspectives we need to adapt to this new Asian landscape.\n\nThe case studies in this book make it clear that the time has come for global business to adapt to China, rather than the other way around. Shaun Rein's proven knack for predicting megatrends will serve as a valuable framework for investors and executives as they strive to understand this enigmatic market. What worked three years ago is certain not to work three years from now, so it's time to get thinking about what The End of Copycat China could mean for you.\n\nFrom the Back Cover\n&quot;A very interesting look at the exciting rise of innovation in China.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Marc Andreesen, Cofounder, Andreesen Horowitz and Cofounder, Netscape Communications\n\n&quot;China is undergoing the most important transformation in its history and Rein provides the road map to understanding how the techies, the entrepreneurs, the venture capitalists, the dreamers, and the tinkerers are driving that change. Decisions are no longer driven by cost-constrained manufacturing but increasingly by cutting-edge innovation. How China is moving, in fits and starts, up the value chain to creativity is the important message of this book, one of the core business messages of the twenty-first century.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Ambassador Frank Lavin, Chairman, Export Now, Former U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade\n\n&quot;Once again, Shaun Rein provides fresh insight. At a time when people are preoccupied with challenges, Shaun sees future opportunities from a unique perspective.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Tim Dattels, Managing Partner, TPG Capital Asia\n\n&quot;Rein gives an insightful guide to the forces driving the maturation of China's economy as it transitions from one based on emulation and adaptation to being propelled by innovation. As an expert on consumer behavior he also provides a useful analysis of how the country's spending classes are maturing alongside its industry, and the opportunities that this implies for businesses operating in China.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€John Quelch, Charles Edward Wilson Professor of Business Administration, Harvard Business School, and Former Dean of CEIBS and London Business School\n\nAbout the Author\nSHAUN REIN is the founder and managing director of the China Market Research Group (CMR), the world's leading strategic market intelligence firm that advises leading international and Chinese companies, private equity firms, and hedge funds about profiting from China's rise.
