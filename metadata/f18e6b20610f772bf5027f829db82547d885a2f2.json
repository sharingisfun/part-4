The album peaked at #16 on The Billboard 200 charts. As with The Illusion of Safety, a portion of the sales of this CD were donated to a charitable cause. In this case, it was the Syrentha J. Savio Endowment. This foundation provides chemotherapy and other medication for those who cannot afford it.\n\nThe album's release date digipak packaging features individual cards that have lyrics, liner notes, an industrial-style photograph, and comments from the band members and the producer.\n\n\n\n\n   1. &quot;Cold Cash and Colder Hearts&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:52\n   2. &quot;Under a Killing Moon&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:41\n   3. &quot;All That's Left&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20\n   4. &quot;Silhouette&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:06\n   5. &quot;Stare at the Sun&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23\n   6. &quot;Paper Tigers&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59\n   7. &quot;Hoods on Peregrine&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:31\n   8. &quot;The Melting Point of Wax&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:29\n   9. &quot;Blood Clots and Black Holes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:49\n  10. &quot;The Artist in the Ambulance&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:39\n  11. &quot;The Abolition of Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:46\n  12. &quot;Don't Tell and We Won't Ask&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59\n\nAs always please seed if you want more music to keep coming your way.Leave Love!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f18e6b20610f772bf5027f829db82547d885a2f2","amp;dn":"Thrice-The+Artist+in+the+Ambulance+320+KBPS+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f18e6b20610f772bf5027f829db82547d885a2f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,142,107,32,97,15,119,43,245,2,127,130,157,184,37,71,216,133,162,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
