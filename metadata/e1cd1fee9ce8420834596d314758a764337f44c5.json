So this version is based on PlayStation-CD image and a PS-emulator. Glitches and crashes could be fixed by manually configuring the emulator (i.e. you should go to the folder you installed SH into, run epsxe.exe from there, re-configure video/sound etc. and run .iso file from the File menu of ePSXe).\n\nIf you have problems downloading/installing/configuring/running - please write comments here. I'll try to help you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1cd1fee9ce8420834596d314758a764337f44c5","amp;dn":"Silent+Hill+1+%28PC%29.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1cd1fee9ce8420834596d314758a764337f44c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,205,31,238,156,232,66,8,52,89,109,49,71,88,167,100,51,127,68,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
