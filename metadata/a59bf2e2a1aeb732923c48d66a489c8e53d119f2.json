Levitt\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This book is a must-read for anyone who cares about world poverty.  It has been years since I read a book that taught me so much. Ã¢â‚¬ËœPoor EconomicsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ represents the best that economics has to offer.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n \nRobert Solow\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo are allergic to grand generalizations about the secret of economic development. Instead they appeal to many local observations and experiments to explore how poor people in poor countries actually cope with their poverty: what they know, what they seem (or don't seem) to want, what they expect of themselves and others, and how they make the choices that they can make. Apparently there are plenty of small but meaningful victories to be won, some through private and some through public action, that together could add up to a large gains for the world's poor, and might even start a ball rolling. I was fascinated and convinced.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a59bf2e2a1aeb732923c48d66a489c8e53d119f2","amp;dn":"Poor+Economics+-+FT+book+of+the+year+-Esther+Duflo+Abhijit+baner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a59bf2e2a1aeb732923c48d66a489c8e53d119f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,155,242,226,161,174,183,50,146,60,72,214,106,72,156,142,83,209,25,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
