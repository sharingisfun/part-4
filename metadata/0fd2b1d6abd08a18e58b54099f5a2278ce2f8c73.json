It was developed by Digital Evolution. Similar in format to first-person exploration games like Myst, Virtual Springfield allows one or two players to explore a 3D simulation of Springfield, the fictional town featured in the well known animation series The Simpsons. Many of the show&amp;#039;s more familiar locations are present, including Moe&amp;#039;s Tavern, Krustylu Studios, Springfield Elementary, and of course the Simpsons&amp;#039; house. Players can point and click to interact with characters and settings. Other than a few mini-games, there is no real objective.\n\nThe game has the nominal overall goal of collecting an entire set of character cards, but their hiding spots can be used more than once. In fact, there are several times as many cards as there are hiding places. Once all the character cards are collected another card appears in your collection, giving the URL of a (now defunct) &amp;#039;secret website&amp;#039; featuring &quot;Frink&amp;#039;s Matter Transporter&quot; (a cheat that allows you to jump to any featured location instantly) and Otto&amp;#039;s map of the town with directions of all the non-interactive locations in the game (Gulp N&amp;#039; Blow, Herman&amp;#039;s store, popsicle-stick skyscraper, etc.)\n\nThere are also several &amp;#039;secret items&amp;#039; to collect, which in turn are used to unlock secret areas.\n\nThe game features dialogue written and recorded by the Simpsons cast and writing staff.\n\nThe game features hundreds of references to past episodes of the show. Almost every episode up until the game&amp;#039;s creation is referenced in some way.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nISO by Big Brother\nAll CDs ripped at 192k unless noted\nFirst posted on www.thepiratebay.se\n\nTeam 1984 \nYour best source for:\n    Rare/Out of Print music\n    Audio/Video Bootlegs\n    Old/Out of Print Software\n    Counter-culture books/text\n    Off the beaten path movies\n    Weird Porn\n    Anything else that we dig..\n\nTeam 1984 doesn&amp;#039;t do mainstream\n          doesn&amp;#039;t follow the herd\n          are just some stoned hippies\n                     with attitude\n\nWant to be a member of Team 1984?\nSimple, \n    Just include this NFO\n             and\n    Don&amp;#039;t up anything lame/mainstream\n\nHails to:\n   freakyflicks, Fat Fuck Frank, sickboy88\n   splattergod, ChrisGoes, Bob Dylan\n\nFuck Off to:\n    RIAA, MPAA, Viacom, Metallica\n              ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fd2b1d6abd08a18e58b54099f5a2278ce2f8c73","amp;dn":"Virtual+Springfield+-+The+Simpsons+PC+game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fd2b1d6abd08a18e58b54099f5a2278ce2f8c73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,210,177,214,171,208,138,24,229,139,84,9,159,90,34,120,206,47,140,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
