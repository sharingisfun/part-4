Writing in both verse and highly lyrical prose, Rilke's work invokes haunting images that focus on the difficulty of communion with the ineffable in an age of disbelief, solitude, and profound anxiety.  These deeply existential themes tend to position him as a transitional figure between the traditional and the modernist writers.\n\nAmong his best-known works are the intensely religious, mystical poems of the DUINO ELEGIES (1922) that weigh beauty and existential suffering; the SONNETS TO ORPHEUS (1922), an astonishing set of richly metaphorical and philosophical variations on the Orpheus myth, conceived in what the poet called a &quot;savage creative storm&quot;; the semi-autobiographical novel NOTEBOOKS OF MALTE LAURIDS BRIGGE (1910), with its profound probing of the quest for individuality, the significance of death, and reflections on the experience of time as death approaches; and LETTERS TO A YOUNG POET (1929), a collection of correspondence published after his death that offer insight into the ideas and themes that appear in Rilke's poetry and his working process.\n\n&quot;Nobody can advise you and help you, nobody,&quot; Rilke advises the aspiring poet.  &quot;There is only one way.  Go into yourself.&quot;\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF and/or ePUB formats as indicated\n\n                                 == POETRY ==\n\n\n* Ahead of All Parting: The Selected Poetry and Prose of Rainer Maria Rilke (Modern Library, 1995).
