James Stewart was also offered the part, but told the producers he believed the script was &quot;too liberal&quot;, and feared the film would be controversial. \n\nThe watch used in the film was a prop, but Harper Lee gave Gregory Peck her father's watch after the film was completed because he reminded her so much of him. \n\nAccording to the comics, this is Clark Kent's (aka Superman) favorite movie. \n\nRanked #2 on the American Film Institute's 100 Most Inspiring Movies of All Time (2006). \n\nIn 2007, the American Film Institute ranked this as the #25 Greatest Movie of All Time. \n\nJune 2008 Ranked #1 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre &quot;Courtroom Drama&quot;. \n\nDespite the novel winning the Pulitzer Prize, the studios were not interested in buying up the film rights as they deemed it lacking in action, there was no love story and the villain doesn't get a big comeuppance. Producer Alan J. Pakula disagreed however and persuaded director Robert Mulligan that it would make a good film. Together they were able to convince Gregory Peck who readily agreed. \n\nAtticus Finch is modeled on Harper Lee's own father, Amasa Lee, an attorney whose 1923 defense of a black client inspired the novel's trial. Gregory Peck met with Amasa Lee - then 82 years old - and formed a strong bond with him. Unfortunately Lee died during filming, so his daughter Harper gave Peck his watch and chain. Peck was wearing that same watch and chain at the Academy Awards the following year when he won the Oscar for Best Actor. \n\n\n\ntorrent name\n\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird (1962) 720p BRrip_sujaidr\n\n\n\nvideo details\n\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;9cd4f5fbf4dcd0a8b2ad&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 8 frames\nMuxing mode                      : Header stripping\nCodec ID                         : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                         : 2h 9mn\nBit rate                         : 950 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                           : 696 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.044\nStream size                      : 859 MiB\n\n\n\n\naudio details\n\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                   : CM (complete main)\nMuxing mode                      : Header stripping\nCodec ID                         : A_AC3\nDuration                         : 2h 9mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 6 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                        : 16 bits\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 118 MiB\n\nSOURCE                           amiable\n\n\nlanguage                         english\n\nsubs                             english muxed\n\n\n\nSAMPLE                  :included\n\n\n\nuploader,encoder\n sujaidr\n\n\n\n\nPLOT:Based on Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning book of 1960. Atticus Finch is a lawyer in a racially divided Alabama town in the 1930s. He agrees to defend a young black man who is accused of raping a white woman. Many of the townspeople try to get Atticus to pull out of the trial, but he decides to go ahead. How will the trial turn out - and will it change any of the racial tension in the town ?\n\n\nDirector: Robert Mulligan\n\nStars:           Gregory Peck, John Megna and Frank Overton\nimdb:   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056592/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056592/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nscreenshots\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/TrtYn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/TrtYn.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/83BSg.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/83BSg.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/o6T40.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/o6T40.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/4QCBI.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/4QCBI.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n               RECOMMENDED PLAYER TO VIEW THE MOVIES ARE KM PLAYER(i use this)  OR  VLC PLAYER\n\n                \n          MY COMPUTER IS RUNNING NON STOP TO PROVIDE THESE MOVIES SO A SIMPLE THANKS WOULD BE ENOUGH.ITS REALLY SAD THAT MANY DOWNLOAD BUT DONT EVEN RATE OR COMMENT\n\n            DONT HIT AND RUN,SEED BACK.LET OTHERS ENJOY TOO AND YOU ARE GETTING THIS FOR FREE SO ATLEAST SEED BACK    \n\n                                      \n\n\n                       SEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.SHARING IS CARING\n\n                       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED \n\n                         DO COMMENT ON THE QUALITY,IT WONT TAKE MUCH OF YOUR TIME  \n                               CHECK OUT MY OTHER TORRENTS \n\n                                                   \n                                             \n\n         to visit my facebook page for requests GOOGLE SUJAIDR\n\nNOTE:due to frequent power cuts,seeding might be interrupted so patience guys and remember to rate,comment,seed AFTER DOWNLOAD and enjoy.\n\nREQUESTS ARE WELCOME AND WILL DO IT WHEN POSSIBLE\n\nafter repeated requests,still there is a lot of hit and run on my torrents.therefore download my movies while i am seeding,get it before the torrent dies\n\n\n\nIF YOU LIKE THE MOVIE THEN DO BUY THE ORIGINAL BLURAY/DVD\n\n\n\n\nPRESS THE +1 TO RATE MY TORRENT AS THERE ARE MORONS WHO INTENTIONALLY NEGATIVE RATE MY TORRENTS SO PLEASE SUPPORT ME BY RATIN UP\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a6e18758eca281f72b754fb8df8a01eeec60fe5","amp;dn":"To+Kill+a+Mockingbird+%281962%29+720p+BRrip_sujaidr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a6e18758eca281f72b754fb8df8a01eeec60fe5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,110,24,117,142,202,40,31,114,183,84,251,141,248,160,30,238,198,15,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
