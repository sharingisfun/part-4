It's scheduled to be released on July 24 2015, through Nuclear Blast. The album's first single, &quot;Nevermore,&quot; premiered on May 22 2015, followed by &quot;Without You&quot; on June 19. Those singles weren't officially released until July 22.\n\nAccording to Romeo, not as many people enjoy concept records as they used to, but he expects to make an album &quot;worth listening to as a whole record. It's what I love about great individual songs, but still an album experience.&quot;[4]\n\nThe album is inspired by Dante's Inferno. While Romeo does not consider Underworld to be a concept album, he admits that there is a common theme:[4]\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ \tWe try to find something to key in on and get the juices flowing, and here the goal was to find something a little dark but with emotional content. I started looking at Dante, and Orpheus in the underworld, where he's going to go to Hades or hell to save this girl. So there's the theme of going to hell and back for something or someone you care about. \tÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe usage of the number three by Dante will also be referenced in the album. the opening track, &quot;Overture&quot;, has three syllables, a three-note melodic phrase, and its verses contain three references to three songs from the band's third album, The Divine Wings of Tragedy.[4]\n\nThe album cover was created by Warren Flanagan and marks the return of masks, as seen in the band's debut album. The art includes different symbol for each of the nine circles of hell mentioned in Dante's work.[4]\nTracklist\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Overture&quot;   \t2:13\n2. \t&quot;Nevermore&quot;   \t5:29\n3. \t&quot;Underworld&quot;   \t5:48\n4. \t&quot;Without You&quot;   \t5:51\n5. \t&quot;Kiss of Fire&quot;   \t5:09\n6. \t&quot;Charon&quot;   \t6:06\n7. \t&quot;To Hell and Back&quot;   \t9:23\n8. \t&quot;In My Darkest Hour&quot;   \t4:22\n9. \t&quot;Run with the Devil&quot;   \t5:38\n10. \t&quot;Swan Song&quot;   \t7:29\n11. \t&quot;Legend&quot;   \t6:29\nTotal length:\n\t63:57[7] \t\nPersonnel\n\n    Jason Rullo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n    Michael Lepond Ã¢Ë†â€™ bass guitar, backing vocals\n    Michael Pinnella Ã¢Ë†â€™ keyboards, backing vocals\n    Michael Romeo Ã¢Ë†â€™ guitar, backing vocals\n    Russell Allen Ã¢Ë†â€™ lead vocals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8141cce86ae6e6c4002989cb04980d8f45b8ca3f","amp;dn":"Symphony+X+-+Underworld+2015+ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8141cce86ae6e6c4002989cb04980d8f45b8ca3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,65,204,232,106,230,230,196,0,41,137,203,4,152,13,143,69,184,202,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
