Wanting to prove them wrong and fulfill his dying grandmotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (Paula Shaw) wish to see him happy in love, Rob goes online and finds Julie (Emily Hampshire), another single New Yorker whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s meddling Jewish mom (Marilu Henner), has driven her to seek a temporary boyfriend.  Rob and Julie agree to pose as a couple through the holidays to get their families off their backs.  But things get complicated when RobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Catholic clan and JulieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Jewish family get involved.  With Christmas coming and Hanukkah around the corner, they double their efforts to keep the charade going, only to discover their fake feelings may be a little too real.\n \n\nCast:\n\nTony Ali ...
