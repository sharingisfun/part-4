Sometimes these temp tracks become the score (as in &quot;2001&quot;), but more often they serve as a template for the film's eventual scorer. That said, we'll boldly climb out on a limb and opine that director Ridley Scott was listening to a whole lot of Holst's The Planets as he was cobbling together his modern gladiator epic. Credit Hans Zimmer for taking &quot;Mars, the Bringer of War&quot; and hammering its familiar harmonic and rhythmic Sturm und Drang into something serviceably fresh; cohort Lisa Gerrard generally handles the more ethereal, atmospheric passages. As epic in scope as its thematic inspiration (and with enough occasional nods to &quot;authenticity&quot; to make it work), this is nonetheless a work of often surprising nuances, and one that recasts the traditional heroic orchestral score in deliciously dark and ominous tones. Warning: repeated listening may inspire the invasion of neighboring countries.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img524.imageshack.us/img524/9052/gladiator1vw4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img524.imageshack.us/img524/9052/gladiator1vw4.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n1.
