I got tired of having to reskin models every time I imported them. So I fixed these and figured I would share them.\n\nPack includes:\n\nAH-64D Apache Longbow\nF-14 Tomcat\nAH-6 Little Bird\nSea Knight\nTiger Attack Helicopter\n\n\nPlease note: I did not make or skin these models. I simply imported them into Element 3D, applied the proper skins, and saved them so others can use them as well in their projects.\n\nJust add the directories to your &quot;MyModels&quot; folder.\n\n\nThanks,\n\nDX123","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5211df69292c580217066279078846b22341a2a3","amp;dn":"5+Military+Aviation+Models+for+Element+3D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5211df69292c580217066279078846b22341a2a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,17,223,105,41,44,88,2,23,6,98,121,7,136,70,178,35,65,162,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
