Titled &quot;Cold Storage,&quot; the web series is developed, produced and directed by Emmy Award winning special effects guru Greg Nicotero. The four, five-minute shorts were produced by Generate for AMC and are now live on AMCTV.com.\n\n&quot;Cold Storage&quot; tells the story of a young man, Chase (played by Josh Stewart), trying to reach his sister in the early days of the zombie apocalypse. He finds temporary shelter in a storage facility run by a former employee named BJ (played Daniel Roebuck); however, things are not what they appear.\n\nIn addition to Stewart (The Dark Knight Rises) and Roebuck (Lost), the cast of &quot;Cold Storage&quot; includes Cerina Vincent (Cabin Fever) as Kelly and Chris Nelson (Kill Bill) as Harris.\n\n\n&quot;It's such a thrill to revisit the The Walking Dead world from a new perspective and tell a bit of a darker story this time around with the webisodes,&quot; said Nicotero. We had a terrific cast, and once again the crew came up with some killer walker gags and visual effects. This year there's a clear nod to the 'show' but our story could definitely exist on it's own as the 'what if' story of The Walking Dead.&quot;\n\n\nList of Episodes:\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=593210#pid593210&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=593210#pid593210&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tDivX\nPack size:  \t\t530 MB \nDuration: \t\t5 min avg. per episode\nWidth: \t\t\t848 pixels\nHeight: \t\t480 pixels\nAspect ratio: \t\t16:9\nFrame rate: \t\t29,97 fps\nAudio: \t\t\tMP3\nNr. of Files:\t\t4 + 1 Teaser + 1 txt = 6\n\n\nAll files properly named.\n\nAfter 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.\n\n###################  You like your show in one pack?  ###################\n#########################  Here you go!  #########################\nVisit the KABLAM!!! @ forum.suprbay.org\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor questions,requests,comments feel free to PM me on SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWant to be kept in the loop?
