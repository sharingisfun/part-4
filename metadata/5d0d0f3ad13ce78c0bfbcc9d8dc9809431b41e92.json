In its coverage of the initial arc, IGN labelled the first issue a surprising success, and, in its review of #115, singled out the series' distinctive humour: &quot;Incredible Hercules #114 is hilarious.&quot; Comics blogger Chris Sims has repeatedly compared it to the famous Walt Simonson run on Thor for &quot;complex, interweaving plotlines that built organically over months, and paid off beautifully&quot; and &quot;big action, emotional moments balanced out with lighthearted humor, and a blending of mythology with the Marvel Universe.&quot;\n\n\nTracked by http://comicpirates.info\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d0d0f3ad13ce78c0bfbcc9d8dc9809431b41e92","amp;dn":"Incredible+Hercules+%28Marvel%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d0d0f3ad13ce78c0bfbcc9d8dc9809431b41e92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,13,15,58,209,60,231,140,11,251,204,157,141,201,128,148,49,180,30,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
