The author takes a step-by-step approach through the basics of arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry and calculus that underpin the management of such data. He then explores the use of matrices, determinants and vectors in the handling of geographic information so that the data may be analyzed and displayed in two-dimensional form either in the visualization of the terrain or as map projections.\n\nSee WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s New in the Second Edition:\n\n    Summaries at the end of each chapter\n    Worked examples of techniques described\n    Additional material on matrices and vectors\n    Further material on map projections\n    New material on spatial correlation\n    A new section on global positioning systems\n\nWritten for those who need to make use geographic information systems but have a limited mathematical background, this book introduces the basic statistical techniques commonly used in geographic information systems and explains best-fit solutions and the mathematics behind satellite positioning. By understanding the mathematics behind the gathering, processing, and display of information, you can better advise others on the integrity of results, the quality of the information, and the safety of using it.\n\nPublisher: CRC Press; 2 edition (May 15, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 146659554X\nISBN-13: 978-1466595545\n\nEditorial Reviews\nReview\n\n&quot;The insight provided by this book is extremely valuable. It represents a significant effort to explain - in an interesting and pedagogical way - the basic mathematical techniques and principles underpinning the manipulation of geographical data. Modern technologies have made the &quot;where&quot; highly important, and computers and mobile devices provide all kind of sophisticated solutions to dealing with this issue. However, it is worth remembering that eventually only good data and good processing will provide reliable information. The mathematics behind this processing thereby becomes essential. This book enables an easy access to the rules and manipulations applied behind the scene. This book is needed.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œStig Enemark, professor of land management, Department of Development and Planning, Aalborg University, Denmark\n\n&quot;Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ an excellent introduction to the mathematics behind these complexities. By having some understanding of the technology behind GIS users are better able to ensure the data and results from GIS are &quot;fit for purpose&quot; and can be safely used. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ I enthusiastically encourage GIS users to read this book.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Ian P. Williamson, Emeritus Professor, The University of Melbourne\n\n&quot;Professor Peter Dale is one of the great pioneers of the GIS and geomatics fields, having made seminal contributions to the development and application of the technology in support of natural resource management and land administration. His writing is richly informed by both a deep intellect and a wealth of experience.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€John McLaughlin, President Emeritus, University of New Brunswick","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be66f1eb78377bd8f22ae30c9a3ebac8b25f5412","amp;dn":"%5BPeter+Dale%5DMathematical+Techniques+in+GIS%2C+Second+Edition+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be66f1eb78377bd8f22ae30c9a3ebac8b25f5412","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,102,241,235,120,55,123,216,242,42,227,12,154,62,186,200,178,95,84,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
