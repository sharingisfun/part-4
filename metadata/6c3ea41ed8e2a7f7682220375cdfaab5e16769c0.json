Some of it is luck in that the time in which it was made allowed Antonio to speak with US polititions from a (sadly) bygone era and, yes, both sides of the aisle were interviewed. It could reasonably be viewed as well inside the anti-Vietnam War camp, as a warning for any of you who supported the war. But, in fairness, it seems to be more of a precocious examination of how and why the US lost (this is made before the Tet Offensive). I wouldn't dismiss it on ideological grounds.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c3ea41ed8e2a7f7682220375cdfaab5e16769c0","amp;dn":"In+the+Year+of+the+Pig+DvdRip+1968+%28War+Documentary%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c3ea41ed8e2a7f7682220375cdfaab5e16769c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,62,164,30,216,226,167,247,104,34,32,55,92,223,170,181,225,103,105,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
