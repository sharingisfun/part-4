For example, mandoo, manti, momo, and bÃ„ï¿½ozi: all of these types of dumplings originated in Central Asia and spread across the Old World beginning in the 12th century. This encyclopedia surveys common street foods in about 100 countries and regions of the world, clearly depicting how &quot;fast foods of the common people&quot; fit into a country or a region's environments, cultural history, and economy. The entries provide engaging information about specific foods as well as coverage of vendor and food stall culture and issues. An appendix of recipes allows for hands-on learning and provides opportunities for readers to taste international street foods at home.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4de38c9b9b49aa40abafe534e46c82321734846a","amp;dn":"Street+Food+Around+The+World+-+Bruce+Kraig+%26amp%3B+Colleen+Taylor+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4de38c9b9b49aa40abafe534e46c82321734846a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,227,140,155,155,73,170,64,171,175,229,52,228,108,130,50,23,52,132,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
