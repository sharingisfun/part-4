Well known for its members' black and white face paint and flamboyant stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid to late 1970s with their elaborate live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits and pyrotechnics. Counting the 1978 solo albums, Kiss has been awarded 28 gold albums to date, the most of any American rock band. The band has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States, of which 20 million have been certified by the RIAA and their worldwide sales exceeds 100 million records, making them one of worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best-selling bands of all time. The original 1973Ã¢â‚¬â€œ'80 lineup consisted of Paul Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals) and Peter Criss (drums and vocals).\n\nWith their makeup and costumes, they took on the personas of comic book-style characters: Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley) and Catman (Criss). Stanley became the &quot;Starchild&quot; because of his tendency to be referred to as the &quot;starry-eyed lover&quot; and &quot;hopeless romantic&quot;. The &quot;Demon&quot; makeup reflected Simmons' cynicism and dark sense of humor, as well as his affection for comic books. Frehley's &quot;Spaceman&quot; makeup was a reflection of his fondness for science fiction and his supposedly being from another planet. Criss' &quot;Catman&quot; makeup was in accordance with the belief that he had nine lives because of his rough childhood in Brooklyn. Due to creative differences, both Criss and Frehley were out of the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes had waned considerably by that point.\n\nBuoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide/Reunion Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have since left Kiss again, but the band continues with Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer. Stanley and Simmons have remained the only two constant members. Kiss has been named in many &quot;Top&quot; lists. They include Number 10 on VH1's '100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock',[5] 9th on 'The Greatest Metal Bands' list by MTV, number one on Hit Paraders's &quot;Top 100 Live Bands&quot;, 56th on VH1's &quot;100 Greatest Artists Of All Time&quot;, and 26th on Gibson's &quot;50 Greatest American Rock Bands&quot;. Kiss was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, ten years after becoming eligible. Kiss was also nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, class of 2014.\n\n\n\nInfo:\n\n&quot;Love Gun&quot;, which was KISS' sixth studio album, was released on June 30, 1977 and was the band's highest charting album to date when it topped out at No. 4. &quot;Love Gun&quot; marks not only the band's first to include lead vocals from all four members Ã¢â‚¬â€ Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons, Ace Frehley and Peter Criss Ã¢â‚¬â€ but the last to feature the original foursome performing the music, with future David Letterman drummer Anton Fig soon becoming KISS' go-to-man behind the scenes.\n\nThe 2CD / digital edition includes the complete original album re-mastered on the first disc, featuring such classics as the title track &quot;Plaster Caster&quot;, the song inspired by Cynthia Plaster Caster, the groupie famous for taking casts of rock star genitalia; &quot;Shock Me&quot;, written about Ace Frehley suffering an electric shock during a concert in Lakeland, Florida; &quot;Christine Sixteen&quot;, and &quot;Then She Kissed Me&quot;, the band's cheeky, gender-switching cover of the CRYSTALS' 1963 hit penned by Jeff Barry, Ellie Greenwich and Phil Spector.\n\nThe second disc is made up of rare, previously unreleased &quot;Love Gun&quot; demos of &quot;Plaster Caster&quot;, &quot;Then She Kissed Me&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow And Tonight&quot; and &quot;Much Too Soon&quot;. Also, the first four lines of the demo &quot;I Know Who You Are&quot; eventually evolved and became the song &quot;Living In Sin&quot;. A glimpse into Paul Stanley's creative process is demonstrated in &quot;Love Gun (Teaching Demo)&quot;, with Stanley talking through the various chords of the song after writing the song with the next version Ã¢â‚¬â€ &quot;Love Gun (Demo)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ being the complete demo performance. &quot;Reputation&quot;, the only previously released demo, was originally included on this year's &quot;KISS 40&quot; compilation.\n\nAlso included is a 1977 interview with Gene Simmons, as well as three never-before-available live tracks from the KISS show at the Capitol Centre, Landover in Maryland from December 20, 1977 Ã¢â‚¬â€ &quot;Love Gun&quot;, &quot;Christine Sixteen&quot; and &quot;Shock Me&quot;. The package also includes liner notes written by DEF LEPPARD's Joe Elliott, who was recently on tour with KISS.\n\nTracklist:\n\nDisc 1 (Original Album)\n\n01. I Stole Your Love\n02.
