I Love You revolves around a young woman with breast cancer who undertakes a mission to find a new wife for her husband before she passes away.\n\nTwenty-seven-year-old Daisy already beat breast cancer four years ago. How can this be happening to her again?\n\nOn the eve of what was supposed to be a triumphant Ã¢â‚¬Å“CancerversaryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with her husband Jack to celebrate four years of being cancer-free, Daisy suffers a devastating blow: her doctor tells her that the cancer is back, but this time itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an aggressive stage four diagnosis. She may have as few as four months left to live. Death is a frightening prospectÃ¢â‚¬â€but not because sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s afraid for herself. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s terrified of what will happen to her brilliant but otherwise charmingly helpless husband when sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no longer there to take care of him. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s this fear that keeps her up at night, until she stumbles on the solution: she has to find him another wife.\n\nWith a singular determination, Daisy scouts local parks and coffee shops and online dating sites looking for JackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perfect match. But the further she gets on her quest, the more she questions the sanity of her plan. As the thought of her husband with another woman becomes all too real, DaisyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forced to decide whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more important in the short amount of time she has left: her husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happinessÃ¢â‚¬â€or her own ?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:251baad273ee62095f29056c19909c2dc82fe14b","amp;dn":"Before+I+Go+-+Colleen+Oakley","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"251baad273ee62095f29056c19909c2dc82fe14b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,27,170,210,115,238,98,9,95,41,5,108,25,144,156,45,200,47,225,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
