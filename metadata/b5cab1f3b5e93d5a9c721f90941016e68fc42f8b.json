A scholar in the arcane field of semiotics, he became best known for his groundbreaking historical mystery novel THE NAME OF THE ROSE (1980).\r\n\r\nHidden behind Eco the novelist was a serious philosopher and literary critic.  His bibliography of non-fiction works on language, culture and belief is vast and forbidding.  Eco founded and developed one of the most important approaches in contemporary semiotics, usually referred to as interpretative semiotics.  He sought to interpret cultures through their signs and symbols -- words, religious icons, banners, clothing, musical scores, even cartoons -- and published more than 20 nonfiction books on these subjects while teaching at the University of Bologna, Europe's oldest university. \r\n\r\nWhile he made many of his scholarly peers uncomfortable with his pop culture celebrity, Eco saw no contradiction in his dual status.  &quot;I think of myself as a serious professor who, during the weekend, writes novels,&quot; he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n==&gt; Please note this collection includes only Eco's non-fiction writings.
