Among the new topics included are, for example, polyhedral metric space, nearness matrix problems, distances between belief assignments, distance-related animal settings, diamond-cutting distances, natural units of length, HeideggerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s de-severance distance, and brain distances.\n\nThe publication of this volume coincides with intensifying research efforts into metric spaces and especially distance design for applications. Accurate metrics have become a crucial goal in computational biology, image analysis, speech recognition and information retrieval.\n\nLeaving aside the practical questions that arise during the selection of a Ã¢â‚¬ËœgoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ distance function, this work focuses on providing the research community with an invaluable comprehensive listing of the main available distances.\n\nAs well as providing standalone introductions and definitions, the encyclopedia facilitates swift cross-referencing with easily navigable bold-faced textual links to core entries. In addition to distances themselves, the authors have collated numerous fascinating curiosities in their WhoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Who of metrics, including distance-related notions and paradigms that enable applied mathematicians in other sectors to deploy research tools that non-specialists justly view as arcane. In expanding access to these techniques, and in many cases enriching the context of distances themselves, this peerless volume is certain to stimulate fresh research.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPDF: 731 pages\nPublisher: Springer; 3rd ed. 2014 edition (October 9, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 3662443414\nISBN-13: 978-3662443415\nAmazon Link:\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:436a9d58ad79e554a7cfaa82a74aff94ddc1ff75","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Distances%2C+3rd+Edition+%282014%29+%7B%3DIMPAVIDUS%3D%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"436a9d58ad79e554a7cfaa82a74aff94ddc1ff75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,106,157,88,173,121,229,84,167,207,170,130,167,74,255,148,221,193,255,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
