HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sold well over 115 million records worldwide to date and has had eight number one singles (&quot;Cracklin Rosie,&quot; &quot;Song Sung Blue,&quot; &quot;Desiree,&quot; &quot;You Don't Bring Me Flowers,&quot; &quot;Love on the Rocks,&quot; &quot;America,&quot; &quot;Yesterday's Songs,&quot; and &quot;Heartlight&quot;), and if he hasn't always generated the kind of critical respect he probably deserves, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been a steady and dependable artist who has managed to keep his large core audience happy. This 23-track set surveys the whole of Diamond's recording career, collecting his key and signature sides, beginning with his first hits for Bang Records in the mid-'60s through his commercial peak for Uni/MCA between 1968 and 1972, cuts from 1980Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s The Jazz Singer (a soundtrack album that went platinum five times over on Capitol Records), and ending with tracks from Diamond's two Rick Rubin-produced albums, 2005Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s 12 Songs and 2008Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Home Before Dark, on Columbia Records. Amazingly, this is the first multi-label single-disc collection of Diamond's signature songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Forever in Blue Jeans,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cherry, Cherry,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Am...I Said,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sweet Caroline,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“CracklinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Rosie,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a Believer,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Holly Holy,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Solitary Man,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Song Sung Blue,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kentucky Woman,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Brother LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Traveling Salvation Show,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ his hit duet with Barbra Streisand Ã¢â‚¬Å“You DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Bring Me Flowers,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and many others. The end result is the perfect career-spanning single-disc introduction to this iconic singer and songwriter.\nAll Music Review by Steve Leggett\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Forever In Blue Jeans\n[02] Beautiful Noise\n[03] Love On The Rocks\n[04] Cherry Cherry\n[05] I Am...I Said\n[06] Sweet Caroline\n[07] Cracklin' Rosie\n[08] Play Me\n[09] I'm A Believer\n[10] Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon\n[11] Holly, Holy\n[12] Solitary Man\n[13] Song Sung Blue\n[14] You Don't Bring Me Flowers\n[15] Hello Again\n[16] Red, Red Wine\n[17] If You Know What I Mean\n[18] Brother Love's Travelling Salvation Show\n[19] Pretty Amazing Grace\n[20] Kentucky Woman\n[21] Shilo\n[22] America\n[23] Hell Yeah\n\nPlay Time - 01h:18m:36s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 189mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
