The solutions cover everything from building dynamic websites and working with databases to network communication, cloud computing, and advanced testing strategies. And more than 60 of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best Clojurians contributed recipes.\n\nEach recipe includes code that you can use right away, along with a discussion on how and why the solution works, so you can adapt these patterns, approaches, and techniques to situations not specifically covered in this cookbook.\n\nMaster built-in primitive and composite data structures\nCreate, develop and publish libraries, using the Leiningen tool\nInteract with the local computer thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s running your application\nManage network communication protocols and libraries\nUse techniques for connecting to and using a variety of databases\nBuild and maintain dynamic websites, using the Ring HTTP server library\nTackle application tasks such as packaging, distributing, profiling, and logging\nTake on cloud computing and heavyweight distributed data crunching\nDive into unit, integration, simulation, and property-based testing\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44750efacd23b9202b138036cb210064e75108ec","amp;dn":"Clojure+Cookbook+-+Recipes+for+Functional+Programming+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44750efacd23b9202b138036cb210064e75108ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,117,14,250,205,35,185,32,43,19,128,54,203,33,0,100,231,81,8,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
