These audiobooks are the only complete unabridged READINGS of the LotR Trilogy and The Hobbit.  Inglis does an awesome job bringing the story to life.\n\nI ripped the Hobbit from 10 audiobook cd's and joined the files into 1 long file. It's over 11 hours of total audio.\n\nFor The LotR audiobooks, I downloaded the files from vtslayer's torrent (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3463119/J.R.R._Tolkien_-_The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Unabridged_Audiobook)and joined the files into longer files with chapter marks.  Each audibook has two files, and the trilogy provides over 55 hours of total audio.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:040b5b9f4d98f29bde7e1fbe2a4dc90f74a4b958","amp;dn":"Unabridged+Lord+of+the+Rings+Trilogy+and+The+Hobbit+Audiobooks+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"040b5b9f4d98f29bde7e1fbe2a4dc90f74a4b958","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,11,91,159,77,152,242,155,222,126,31,190,42,77,201,15,116,164,185,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
