In the game, players can choose to take on the role of either an agent of Light or Darkness, with separate, unique missions reflecting the nature of that decision. \n\nSeveral changes have been made to the PC and GameCube versions of Enclave, based on feedback from those who played the Xbox version. The game&amp;#039;s control system has been tightened up for the GameCube, while the mouse and keyboard implementation on the PC gives gamers a much better feel for their character&amp;#039;s motions and movements. \n\nA new save system has been implemented, which allows gamer&amp;#039;s to save their progress at any point in a level. Additionally, both Light and Dark missions are now available for play from the beginning of the game.\n\nEnclave ESRB rating\nMature \n\nEnclave system requirements\nWindows 98/2000/ME/XP, P3 600MHz, 192MB RAM, 2.2GB free hard disk space, 16MB 3D card with transform &amp; lighting.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d416354f356b0aa9b90b61f5751e8fc5e78df96","amp;dn":"Enclave-the+game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d416354f356b0aa9b90b61f5751e8fc5e78df96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,65,99,84,243,86,176,170,155,144,182,31,87,81,232,252,94,120,223,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
