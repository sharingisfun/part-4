With their\r\ninitial records, the group crossed the bridge between punk/new wave and Top 40 pop\r\nmore than any other band, recording a series of hard, spiky singles that were also melodic\r\nand immediately accessible. Hynde was an invigorating, sexy singer who bent the traditional\r\nmale roles of rock &amp; roll to her own liking, while guitarist James Honeyman-Scott created a\r\nsonic palette filled with suspended chords, effects pedals, and syncopated rhythms that\r\nproved remarkably influential over the next two decades. After Honeyman-Scott's death,\r\nThe Pretenders became a more straightforward rock band, yet Hynde's semi-autobiographical\r\nsongwriting and bracing determination meant that the group never became just another\r\nrock band, even when their music became smoother and more pop-oriented","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fba9365fca2d998a2c4c4c2f52fed2324685b6ce","amp;dn":"The+Pretenders+-+The+Singles+-+1987+%28MP3-320kbps%29+-+%5B%3DFaith%3D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fba9365fca2d998a2c4c4c2f52fed2324685b6ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,169,54,95,202,45,153,138,44,76,76,47,82,254,210,50,70,133,182,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
