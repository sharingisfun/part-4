Chisu Ryu plays another of Ozu&amp;#039;s realistic middle-class types, this time a widower with a marriageable daughter. Not wishing to see the girl resign herself to spinsterhood, Ryu pretends that he himself is about to be married. The game plan is to convince the daughter that they&amp;#039;ll be no room for her at home, thus forcing her to seek comfort and joy elsewhere. What makes this homey little domestic episode work is the rapport between Chisu Ryu and Setsuko Hara, who plays the daughter. Late Spring is no facile Hollywood farce; we like these people, believe in them, and wish them the best.\n\nENGLISH SUBS\n\n\nFile Name .........................................: Late.Spring.1949.DVDRip.XviD-FRAGMENT.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 732,893,184 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:47:55\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD Dev ver. 11-Jun-03\nFrame Size ......................................: 560x416 (AR: 1.346)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 815 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.146 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 77 kb/s [1 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n \n\n******************************* FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
