Tali (Mercedes Moran) is minding four small children with little help from her husband, who is preoccupied with the opening of hunting season, as a record hot spell grips Argentina. Things aren't much better for her cousin Mecha (Graciela Borges), who is looking after four teenagers and a husband (Martin Adjemian) who can hardly be bothered to help out, but Mecha does have a pool, even if it hasn't been cleaned in quite a while. Tali and her brood end up spending much of the summer with Mecha as the town is riveted by the appearance of the Virgin Carmen on the city's water tower, and a series of thunderstorms add an awful humidity to the summer's unbearable heat.\n\nRip Specs (BD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : La Cienaga.2001.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 8 011 Kbps\nLength            : 5.65 GiB for 1h 41mn 0s 55ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 6 500 Kbps\nAspect            : 1280 x 690 (1.855) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : DTS at 1 509 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #2           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : pt\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240419/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240419/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Spanish\nSubtitles: English, Portuguese\n\nMy rip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:451e94a1e055677bae65f0f5bde1b99e33bed01b","amp;dn":"La+Cienaga.2001.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"451e94a1e055677bae65f0f5bde1b99e33bed01b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,30,148,161,224,85,103,123,174,101,240,245,189,225,185,158,51,190,208,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
