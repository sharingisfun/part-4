In this course, discover how to use the complete Edge Animate toolset to lay out and animate motion graphics for your website, mobile devices, digital magazine, iBooks, and more. Author Chris Converse shows you how to build basic compositions with shapes, text, images, and SVG files; animate the different elements with Auto Keyframe and Auto Transition features; trigger actions based on the timeline position or your visitor's mouse clicks and movements; and incorporate custom HTML, audio, and video. Chris also shows how to make your content accessible to the broadest audience possible with responsive layouts, incorporate web fonts from various online services, and accommodate older browsers. The final chapters in the course show how to use content from other applications like Flash or After Effects and take it to the next level with Edge Animate.\n\n\nTopics include:\n\nWhat is Edge Animate?\nCreating a new project\nImporting and manipulating content\nPreparing content in Photoshop, Fireworks, or Illustrator\nAdding text to a composition\nAnimating with the Toggle Pin\nSetting easing options\nAnimating clip and background positions\nLooping animation\nWorking with symbols\nTargeting elements with actions\nWorking with HTML and CSS in the Code panel\nUsing responsive layout presets\nPublishing for the web or iBooks\nGoing from Edge Animate to Flash, After Effects, Photoshop, Sencha Animator, or Tumult Hype","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d3ce74befdb62a12d50866167a58cafb3a5896a","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Edge+Animate+Essential+Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d3ce74befdb62a12d50866167a58cafb3a5896a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,60,231,75,239,219,98,161,45,80,134,97,103,165,140,175,179,165,137,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
