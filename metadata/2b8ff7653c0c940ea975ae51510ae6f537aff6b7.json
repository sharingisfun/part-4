But inside the wine cellar, they find something considerably more disturbing: a bricked-up niche that once held a crumbling skeleton. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNarrated by: Rene Auberjonois\r\nLength: 10 hrs and 46 mins\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nUnabridged Audiobook\r\nRelease Date:11-10-15\r\nPublisher: Hachette Audio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b8ff7653c0c940ea975ae51510ae6f537aff6b7","amp;dn":"Douglas+Preston%2C+Lincoln+Child+-+Crimson+Shore+%28Pendergast+%2315%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b8ff7653c0c940ea975ae51510ae6f537aff6b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,143,247,101,60,12,148,14,169,117,174,81,81,10,230,245,55,175,246,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
