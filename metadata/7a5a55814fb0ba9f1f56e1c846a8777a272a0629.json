He is considered one of the most important contributors to the development of the medium and is known for the cartooning studio he founded; for his highly influential series The Spirit; for his use of comics as an instructional medium; for his leading role in establishing the graphic novel as a form of literature with his book A Contract with God and Other Tenement Stories; and for his educational work about the medium as exemplified by his book Comics and Sequential Art.\n\nIn 1988, the comics community paid tribute to Eisner by creating the Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards, more commonly known as &quot;the Eisners&quot;, to recognize achievements each year in the comics medium. Eisner enthusiastically participated in the awards ceremony, congratulating each recipient.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Eisner&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Eisner&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOfficial Web Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.willeisner.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.willeisner.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a5a55814fb0ba9f1f56e1c846a8777a272a0629","amp;dn":"Will+Eisner+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a5a55814fb0ba9f1f56e1c846a8777a272a0629","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,90,85,129,79,176,186,159,31,86,225,200,70,168,119,122,39,42,6,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
