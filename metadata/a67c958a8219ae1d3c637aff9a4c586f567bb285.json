In recent years there have been significant developments in methodological and technological tools to prevent and reduce the deleterious effects of analytical activities; key strategies include recycling, replacement, reduction and detoxification of reagents and solvents.\r\n\r\nThe Handbook of Green Analytical Chemistry provides a comprehensive overview of the present state and recent developments in green chemical analysis. A series of detailed chapters, written by international specialists in the field, discuss the fundamental principles of green analytical chemistry and present a catalogue of tools for developing environmentally friendly analytical techniques.\r\n\r\nTopics covered include:\r\n\r\nConcepts: Fundamental principles, education, laboratory experiments and publication in green analytical chemistry.\r\nThe Analytical Process: Green sampling techniques and sample preparation, direct analysis of samples, green methods for capillary electrophoresis, chromatography, atomic spectroscopy, solid phase molecular spectroscopy, derivative molecular spectroscopy and electroanalytical methods.\r\nStrategies: Energy saving, automation, miniaturization and photocatalytic treatment of laboratory wastes.\r\nFields of Application: Green bioanalytical chemistry, biodiagnostics, environmental analysis and industrial analysis.\r\nThis advanced handbook is a practical resource for experienced analytical chemists who are interested in implementing green approaches in their work","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a67c958a8219ae1d3c637aff9a4c586f567bb285","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Green+Analytical+Chemistry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a67c958a8219ae1d3c637aff9a4c586f567bb285","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,124,149,138,130,25,174,29,60,99,122,255,154,76,88,111,86,123,178,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
