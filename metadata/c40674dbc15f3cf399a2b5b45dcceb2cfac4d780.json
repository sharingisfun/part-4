I actually had this for years but didn't share it since no one seemed interested in it. This upload contains the latest version of this aircraft, which can be installed with or without Accu-Sim. If you are unfamiliar with A2A's products or unsure about the installation sequence, check the Readme file I have included.\n\nI know this is a relatively old product from A2A Simulations, but aside from the much less detailed maintenance hangar, it is still almost as good as their more modern offerings. As a matter of fact, it is a great aircraft which used to be one of my favourites; the only reason I don't fly it that much anymore is the relatively low forward visibility in the cockpit.\n\nSeed and enjoy, pirates!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c40674dbc15f3cf399a2b5b45dcceb2cfac4d780","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%5D+A2A+Wings+of+Power+3+P-47+Razorback+with+Accu-Sim","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c40674dbc15f3cf399a2b5b45dcceb2cfac4d780","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,6,116,219,193,95,60,243,153,162,181,180,93,204,235,44,250,196,215,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
