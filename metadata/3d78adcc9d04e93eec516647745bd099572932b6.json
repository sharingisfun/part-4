But James Luceno delivers. On a scale up to five stars, I'd easily give this one a four and half. The only reason for the deduction being ... I was left wanting more! Even with the massive amount of formatting and mis-scan errors I had to deal with, the book was still highly enjoyable to read.\n\nLuceno devotes a huge amount of time to his two main characters, the titular Vader, and a Jedi Knight on the run in the aftermath of Order Sixty-SixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Roan Shryne. Both are struggling with their own internal issues, and Luceno masterfully delves into this in the novels. Shryne's issues involve a failing connection to the Force, the loss fellow Jedi and Padawans, and a recent connection to his past. And while Shryne is an interesting character, the chapters readers will be aching for more of are the ones dealing with newly-minted Sith Lord, Darth Vader.\n\nVader is dealing with the massive schism between the values and memories of Anakin and the dark evil deeds he has done as Vader. In addition to his identity crisis issues (and even tied into them somewhat), Vader is dealing with his new cybernetic suit and limbs, which he not only feels uncomfortable in, but trapped by. But as if those struggles aren't enough, Vader is also just getting involved in the Apprentice/Master relationship/struggle of the Sith rule of two. His master, Darth SideousÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Galactic Emperor PalpatineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“is trying to teach him the biggest difference between the Jedi and the Sith: While the Jedi gain power through understanding ... the Sith gain understanding through power.\n\nNow, once again, I'm pretty sure I got about 95% of the errors and mis-scans (including the somewhat infamous known error in Chapter 37 where Moff Tarkin's Star Destroyer Executrix is mistakenly referred to as the Executor) but if you do find any that I missed, please let me know what they are and what chapter they were in so I can correct them myself. If it's more than one or two, I'll probably be inclined to re-up them.\n\nOnce again, I included a quick MOBI convert for all the Kindle users out there that prefer that format. For those who are enjoying these edited eBooks, I'm planning to go through the retail copy of Darth Plagueis by Luceno that I obtained from kileko's torrents.\n\n\n\nAdditional Info\n\n\nIf you're wondering how to read these files, keep all your books organized, convert them to a more useful format, or sync them over to your reader devices (including the popular Kindles, nooks, and iPads), check out calibre, the world's best eBook program.\n\nAnd for those wondering just how I so easily edit these books, it's simple. As I read them on my nook, I use the highlight function to make a note of any errors, then use Sigil to fix them. Easy as pie.\n\nAfter downloading, please leave your client open and the torrent actively seeding so others may download as well and your ratio will remain high! Also remember not to severely limit your upload speed by over-throttling. Be kind, rewind! Remember to eat your green vegetables. And ...\n\n-- Please Enjoy and Keep Seeding for Others to Enjoy!! --","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d78adcc9d04e93eec516647745bd099572932b6","amp;dn":"Star+Wars%3A++Dark+Lord+-+The+Rise+of+Darth+Vader+%5BEdited%5D+--+VoV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d78adcc9d04e93eec516647745bd099572932b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,120,173,204,157,4,233,62,236,81,102,71,116,91,208,153,87,41,50,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
