Blessed with a four-octave vocal range, Rawls&amp;#039; smooth, classy elegance -- sort of a cross between Sam Cooke and Nat King Cole -- permeated nearly everything he sang, yet the fire of his early gospel days was never too far from the surface. He made his name as a crooner, first by singing jazz standards, then moving on to soul in the mid-&amp;#039;60s, and capped the most commercial phase of his career with a productive stint at Philadelphia International during the latter half of the &amp;#039;70s. Even after his days as a chart presence were over, Rawls remained a highly visible figure on the American cultural landscape, pursuing an acting and voice-over career in addition to his continued concert appearances, and doing extensive charity work on behalf of the United Negro College Fund.\n\n\n\n01.
