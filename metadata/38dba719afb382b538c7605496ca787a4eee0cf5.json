Alternatively, they rely on code from a third party. But in all these cases they need to know how to either construct a cross-browser library from scratch or be adept at using and maintaining their library of choice.\n\nIn Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja, JavaScript expert John Resig reveals the inside know-how of the elite JavaScript programmers. Written to be accessible to JavaScript developers with intermediate-level skills, this book will give you the knowledge you need to create a cross-browser JavaScript library from the ground up.\n\nThis book takes you on a journey towards mastering modern JavaScript development in three phases: design, construction, and maintenance. You first are given a base of strong, advanced JavaScript knowledge, enabling you to make decisions about the overall design of a library and how to tackle its eventual construction. The book then teaches you how to construct your library. It examines all the numerous tasks JavaScript libraries have to tackle and provides practical solutions and development strategies for their creation. It then guides you through the various maintenance techniques you will need to keep your code running well into the future.\n\nWith Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja you will have all the knowledge you need to build your own JavaScript library and to use any modern JavaScript library.\n\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Inside\n- Advanced features of the JavaScript language\n- Detailed cross-browser code problems and solutions\n- Best practices\n\nTable of Contents\nPART 1: PREPARING FOR TRAINING\nChapter 1.
