This was one of my first Coursera batch-downloads, so there may be missing subtitles. Sorry for the mess.\n\n######################################################\n\nThe course covers the basics: representing games and strategies, the extensive form (which computer scientists call game trees), repeated and stochastic games, coalitional games, and Bayesian games (modeling things like auctions).\n\nPopularized by movies such as &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, game theory is the mathematical modeling of strategic interaction among rational (and irrational) agents. Beyond what we call 'games' in common language, such as chess, poker, soccer, etc., it includes the modeling of conflict among nations, political campaigns, competition among firms, and trading behavior in markets such as the NYSE. How could you begin to model eBay, Google keyword auctions, and peer to peer file-sharing networks, without accounting for the incentives of the people using them? The course will provide the basics: representing games and strategies, the extensive form (which computer scientists call game trees), Bayesian games (modeling things like auctions), repeated and stochastic games, and more. We'll include a variety of examples including classic games and real-world applications.\n\nMore information about this course available at https://www.coursera.org/course/gametheory","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8455373123667a4f0a635a877688caa36edaf389","amp;dn":"%5BCoursera%5D+Game+Theory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8455373123667a4f0a635a877688caa36edaf389","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,85,55,49,35,102,122,79,10,99,90,135,118,136,202,163,110,218,243,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
