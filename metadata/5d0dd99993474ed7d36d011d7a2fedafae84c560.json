It is true to both traditional Chinese medicine and contemporary energy medicine. This book is a tremendous resource.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€(Donna Eden, author of Energy Medicine) \n\n&quot;Dr. Dalet's impressive work is a major contribution to the lay person's understanding of holistic medical care. Its strong points include concise explanations of the causes of diseases and dysfunctions, helpful distinctions between acute and chronic conditions, easy-to-use organization, and the combination of diagrams and photos to aid in precisely locating acupoints for treatment. The Encyclopedia of Healing Points sits high on my shelf of essential resources for maintaining and enhancing health.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€(Mary Bond, author of The New Rules of Posture) \n\nA safe and effective technique for finding relief from pain and illnessÃ¢â‚¬â€be it a cold or flu, asthma or arthritisÃ¢â‚¬â€is, quite literally, right at your fingertips.
