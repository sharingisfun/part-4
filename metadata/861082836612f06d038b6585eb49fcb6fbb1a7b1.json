Like Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932) and the later The Raven (1935), the link \nbetween PoeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work and the end film is minimal ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ indeed here only Werdegast's irrational \nfear of cats links the film with the story of its title. Originally to have been much stronger \nin its violent themes, test-audience outrage meant reshoots were in order and a number of \nchanges were made to the final picture.\n\nThe story boasts a solid opening 45 minutes of intrigue and character build-up - from the \nmoment we meet Lugosi's Werdegast it is as though the characters have entered a nightmare \n(a theme that was sadly not exploited in this film), the introduction of Poelzig only further \ncompounds the mystery as both men act courteously yet threateningly to each other. The two \nplay a game of chess over Joan, with Poelzig determined to keep her in his house if he should \nwin - sadly though this game is never really shown in any detail and could have provided a lot \nof tension. The film really starts to take a downturn when the local police arrive to investigate \nthe bus crash, their comedy relief destroying the eerie, isolated atmosphere that the film had \nboasted up to the point. In the last twenty minutes the pace picks up rapidly, much to the \ndetriment of the film - suddenly there is a Satanic ritual and just as quickly it ends for \nno reason; Joan bumps into Werdegast's daughter and suddenly she is dead, for no obvious reason. \nThe ending comes as a real cop-out considering the tension built up and the comic-relief epilogue \njust breaks the camel's back.\n\nOn the plus side, direction is decent and the set designs are outstanding. Although the build-up \nsuggests that Poelzig will be living in a gothic castle, he in fact inhabits an ultra-modern (1930s) \nhouse with sliding metal doors and large windows. This helps to keep the film away from the normal \nhorror clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s and gives it an interesing new edge. Although the camerawork is quite standard for \nthe most part, there are a few standout scenes. In one, the camera moves along a corridor around \nthe house as Karloff continues to talk in the background - while Poelzig's introductions, first in \nsilhouette and then coming through a door that he does not seem to open (see: The Mummy (1932)), \nlook very impressive. The music is a standard Universal affair, with the usual hints of Bach's \nToccata and Fugue in D Minor on the organ.\n\nKarloff and Lugosi are together on screen for the first time and they don't disappoint. Both actors \nseem to be trying to outdo each other with creepy voices and look very impressive when switching from \nthreatening each other to being hospitable to Peter when he bumbles into scene. David Manners, as \nPeter, gives a typically meek performance although one well suited to the role.\n\nThe Black Cat is the start of a very good film but sadly suffers from a rushed and confused finalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©. \nFor fans of Karloff and Lugosi who enjoy their distinctive style, this film is a dream come true and \nfinds them both at the peak of their acting prowess. Recommended to fans of the duo, or of Universal \nHorror pictures - this one of their best entries outside of the well-known monster pictures.\n\n--------------- SCREENSHOTS ----------------     \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/33000/photo-32692.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/33000/photo-32692.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/33000/photo-32694.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/33000/photo-32694.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/33000/photo-32695.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/33000/photo-32695.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/33000/photo-32696.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/33000/photo-32696.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/33000/photo-32697.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/33000/photo-32697.jpg&lt;/a&gt;    \n      \n---------------------------------------------   \n\nINFO  \n      \n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 700 MiB\n      Duration : 1h 5mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 494 Kbps\n      Writing library : VirtualDub-MPEG2 build 24586/release\n   \nVideo\n      \n      \n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : DX50\n      Codec ID/Hint : DivX 5\n      Duration : 1h 5mn\n      Bit rate : 1 405 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3 (1.33:1)\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.191\n      Stream size : 658 MiB (94%)\n      Writing library : DivX 6.8.4\n   \nAudio\n      \n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 5mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 80.0 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 37.5 MiB (5%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 512 ms\n      \nSource\n   \n      DVD - Region One 720 x 480 4:3 (1.33:1) NTSC (29.970) \n      B&amp;W 192 Kb/s AC3 Dolby Mono 48.0 KHz\n      \n      NO SUBS\n   \n---------- CURRENT TORRENT STATS ----------      \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/6585/81d093c2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/6585/81d093c2.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:861082836612f06d038b6585eb49fcb6fbb1a7b1","amp;dn":"The+Black+Cat+1934+DivX-NvadR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"861082836612f06d038b6585eb49fcb6fbb1a7b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,16,130,131,102,18,240,109,3,139,101,133,235,73,252,182,251,177,167,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
