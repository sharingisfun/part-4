And the live portion is among the best live Muddy on record - right up there with &quot;Mojo - The Live Collection&quot; and &quot;Muddy Waters At Newport 1960&quot;.\nHighly recommended.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nMuddy Waters - Fathers and Sons\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Muddy Waters\nAlbum................: Fathers and Sons\nGenre................: Blues\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1989\n\nMP3 320cbr\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
