Tech entrepreneurs are societyÃ¢Â€â„¢s chaos monkeys, disruptors testing and transforming every aspect of our lives, from transportation (Uber) and lodging (AirBnB) to television (Netflix) and dating (Tinder). One of Silicon ValleyÃ¢Â€â„¢s most audacious chaos monkeys is Antonio GarcÃ­a MartÃ­nez.\r\n\r\nAfter stints on Wall Street and as CEO of his own startup, GarcÃ­a MartÃ­nez joinednascent advertising team, turning its usersÃ¢Â€â„¢ data into profit for COO Sheryl Sandberg and chairman and CEO Mark â€œZuckâ€ Zuckerberg. Forced out in the wake of an internal product war over the future of the companyÃ¢Â€â„¢s monetization strategy, GarcÃ­a MartÃ­nez eventually landed at rival Twitter. He also fathered two children with a woman he barely knew, committed lewd acts and brewed illegal beer on thecampus (accidentally flooding Zuckerberg's desk), lived on a sailboat, raced sport cars on the 101, and enthusiastically pursued the life of an overpaid Silicon Valley wastrel.\r\n\r\nNow, this gleeful contrarian unravels the chaotic evolution of social media and online marketing and reveals how it is invading our lives and shaping our future. Weighing in on everything from startups and credit derivatives to Big Brother and data tracking, social media monetization and digital â€œprivacy,â€ GarcÃ­a MartÃ­nez shares his scathing observations and outrageous antics, taking us on a humorous, subversive tour of the fascinatingly insular tech industry. Chaos Monkeys lays bare the hijinks, trade secrets, and power plays of the visionaries, grunts, sociopaths, opportunists, accidental tourists, and money cowboys who are revolutionizing our world. The question is, will we survive?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42c33be68112549a506ec5c1e9cfd9947ab651fd","amp;dn":"Chaos+Monkeys+%3A+Obscene+Fortune+and+Rando","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42c33be68112549a506ec5c1e9cfd9947ab651fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,195,59,230,129,18,84,154,80,110,197,193,233,207,217,148,122,182,81,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
