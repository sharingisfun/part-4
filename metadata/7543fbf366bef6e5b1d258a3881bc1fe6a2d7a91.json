All 23 episodes of the 1st CSI NY season were present within this torrent. All the episodes were recorded from CBS HD, and are in high-definition. However, if you want to watch in HD, you&amp;#039;ll need a upconverting DVD player and a HDTV. Even if you dont have any of the previously metioned stuff, the playback quality is excellent (99% error free).\n\nThere was only very minor problems with the episodes. Each episode would get glitchy once or twice, however the glitchiness would last less then a second and did not affect the outcome of the episode. \n\nIf looking to burn to DVD, I suggest using ConvertXtoDVD. Only burn 4 episodes per disc however, anymore will increase the chances of playback issues. Burning with Verbatim DVD discs is also a suggestion I would make. They basically make the best disc with 99.9% flawless burning.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7543fbf366bef6e5b1d258a3881bc1fe6a2d7a91","amp;dn":"CSI+New+York+Season+01+%28Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7543fbf366bef6e5b1d258a3881bc1fe6a2d7a91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,67,251,243,102,190,246,229,177,210,88,163,136,27,193,254,106,45,122,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
