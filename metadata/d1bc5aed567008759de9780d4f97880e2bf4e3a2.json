Their career began modestly, with a pair of albums inspired by the positive-minded likes of A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul. After adding Fergie, the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pop instincts reached full flight. Ignited by the Top Ten hit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhere Is the Love?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the Grammy-winning party anthem ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Get It Started,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the group scored three multi-platinum albums in 2003ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Elephunk, 2005ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Monkey Business, and 2009ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s The E.N.D. (Energy Never Dies). While still connected to hip-hop, the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sound turned toward dance-pop -- a savvy move that transformed them from a cult act to a mainstream phenomenon. \n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01.
