This book will introduce global investors to the basics of forex (foreign exchange) trading and provide them with a solid framework for analyzing currencies and profiting from their fluctuations. Topics covered include the forces that cause exchange rates to fluctuate, an overview of the mechanics of trading, analytical and forecasting tools, how to profit from pricing trends, and common pitfalls that often ensnare traders. \n\nWhile most books make grandiose promises of instant success and large profits, Forex for Beginners represents an alternative approach to investing in forex.

You will gain an understanding of how currency markets work and use this knowledge to generate income.\n\nWhat youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn\n\nInvestors from all countries will:\n\n-Understand how global currency markets operate and how currencies are exchanged\n-Learn why exchange rates fluctuate, from the standpoint of economics and human psychology\n-Open an account and become fluent in the mechanics of trading foreign exchange\n-Learn how to avoid getting skinned alive by trading professionals and brokers\n-Adapt your personality and financial circumstances to a specific approach to analyzing and trading currencies\n-Avoid pitfalls and limit risk to prevent profit from turning to loss\n-Earn money and have fun trading\n\nWho this book is for\n\nForex for Beginners: A Comprehensive Guide to Profiting from the Global Currency Markets is a guide to trading currencies for those with some investing experience but who lack the specific knowledge they need to trade forex. This guide does not promote a get-rich-quick approach, nor is it predicated on overly complex methods.
