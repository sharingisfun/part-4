Not content at any time to rest on his laurels, he has been involved in quite a few important musical projects, and his musical curiosity has never dimmed. A masterful pianist who, along with Herbie Hancock and Keith Jarrett, was one of the top stylists to emerge after Bill Evans and McCoy Tyner, Corea is also one of the few electric keyboardists to be quite individual and recognizable on synthesizers. In addition, he has composed several jazz standards, including &quot;Spain,&quot; &quot;La Fiesta,&quot; and &quot;Windows.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1712e08a610c74f50beb73eea44221aafd6efd0d","amp;dn":"Chick+Corea+24+Bit+Vinyl+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1712e08a610c74f50beb73eea44221aafd6efd0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,18,224,138,97,12,116,245,11,235,115,238,164,66,33,170,253,110,253,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
