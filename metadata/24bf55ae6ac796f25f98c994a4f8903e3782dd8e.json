Subsequently,\nmonstrous creatures have risen from the watery depths of the sea and\ntheir attacks have brought all seafaring to a grinding halt. The hero,\nnow a member of the Inquisition, is sent out to find out how to stop\nthe chaos caused by these creatures from the deep. His quest begins\nwith rumors that the pirates who frequent the southern islands are the\nonly ones who know a way to get rid of the creatures once and for all\nand end their reign of terror.\n\nWith an all-new pirate-based theme, Risen 2: Dark Waters aims to\ncombine the most loved classic RPG gameplay mechanics of the original\nRisen with a fresh theme and setting on a huge variety of themed island\nlocales. A third-person role-playing game set in a dark and gritty\nuniverse, Risen 2: Dark Waters maintains the most immersive features of\nthe original Risen, with multiple approaches to every challenge\nallowing players to shape the game world based on their own decisions.\nThese choices will serve to unlock new paths, features and additional\nskills for the character. Together with a highly interactive\nenvironment and a full day/night-cycle affecting countless aspects of\nthe game world, Risen 2 will be set in the most immersive RPG game\nworld so far.\n\nINSTALL NOTES\n\n2.
