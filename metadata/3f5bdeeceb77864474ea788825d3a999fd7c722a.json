An Introduction\n\nFollett Publishing Company | 1971 | ISBN: 0695801392 | English | 200 pages | PDF | 30.5 MB\n\nIn the first part of his book, Howard Greenfeld gives an account of Picasso's early years, his childhood and adolescence. The second part of the book traces the development of Picasso the artist, with high points of his long and prolific career. It is an introduction to the work of this towering genius of the twentieth century. Many illustrations in color and black and white show the remarkable stages of Picasso's artistic development from his early haunting realism through the invention of cubism with Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, the violent and highly expressive Guernica, to the more serene yet still controversial work of his late period","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f5bdeeceb77864474ea788825d3a999fd7c722a","amp;dn":"Pablo+Picasso+-+an+introduction+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f5bdeeceb77864474ea788825d3a999fd7c722a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,91,222,236,235,119,134,68,116,234,120,136,37,211,169,153,253,124,114,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
