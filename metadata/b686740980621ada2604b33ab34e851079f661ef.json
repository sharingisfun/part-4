(she co-edited his Seul contre tous, he shot her medium-length The Eyes of Jean-Pierre). But shelve all preconceptions: her long-awaited debut feature Innocence is unlike anything you may be expecting. Haunting, boldly original and altogether uncanny, Innocence, based on a story by Frank Wedekind, is set in a girls&amp;#039; school situated deep in a forest, where new pupils arrive in boxes and are raised in a strict but benign old-world atmosphere. The girls live in small groups, each age allotted a different coloured hair ribbon, but the sweetly idyllic atmosphere has a sinister undertow. What happens in the main building, where the older girls go at night, and where do the mysterious subterranean tunnels lead? Innocence creates an eerie self-enclosed world, where fetishistic images of childhood and femininity are pushed to their limits. Hadzihalilovic&amp;#039;s vision has echoes of artists such as Bellmer and Balthus, and film-makers BuÃƒÂ±uel and Borowczyk, but from a female Gothic perspective that gives the film an edge that Angela Carter surely would have relished. A very young ensemble cast give a miraculous collective performance. It&amp;#039;s a long, long way from Malory Towers. \n\n\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\nwww.freakyflicks.tk\n\nSEED AT LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE!\n\n&amp;#039;If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, these torrents will NEVER DIE&amp;#039;\n\nSimply search for &amp;#039;freakyflicks&amp;#039; \n*************************************** \n************** FREAKYFLICKS ************* \n***************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b686740980621ada2604b33ab34e851079f661ef","amp;dn":"Innocence+%28Lucile+Hadzihalilovic%2C+2004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b686740980621ada2604b33ab34e851079f661ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,134,116,9,128,98,26,218,38,4,179,58,179,78,133,16,121,246,97,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
