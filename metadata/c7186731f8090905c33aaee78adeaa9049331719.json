The clarity Anne uses in picking what to include, when to introduce it, and how to do so is remarkable.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Had I bought your VB book first, I would have saved myself lots of dollars and several monthsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ time.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nNow, Anne Boehm continues this tradition of quality and usefulness in the latest edition of our VB text, written for Visual Basic 2012.\n\nOf course, the content continues to evolve with the language. So in this edition, Anne has added a chapter on Windows 8 programming that gets you started creating touchscreen applications for tablets. And sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s updated the material wherever VB 2012 differs from earlier releases.\n\nBut she hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t changed the overall approach. So whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re new to VB developmentÃ¢â‚¬Â¦or youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re upgrading to VB 2012 and need an up-to-date referenceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find that this book is packed with the information you need, delivered in a way thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s made earlier editions such favorites among professional developers:\n\n- ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s concise, practical, and crystal-clear in telling you what you need to know.\n- It shows you how to get the most from Visual Studio 2012 as you design, code, debug, and deploy Windows Forms applications using VB 2012.\n- It gives you solid training in the essential skills that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll use every day, including data validationÃ¢â‚¬Â¦handling numeric, date, and string dataÃ¢â‚¬Â¦working with arrays and collectionsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦handling exceptionsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦working with text, binary, and XML filesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and understanding how OOP works.\n- It gives you a 4-chapter section on database programmingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦far more than youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find in any other VB book, even though database handling is essential in business applications.\n- It introduces you to LINQ, the .NET feature that lets you use VB to query almost any data source, from databases to arrays to XML files.\n- It shows you how to build real-world applications so you always see how the features youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re learning interact with each other.\n- It gives you chapter exercises that let you practice what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re learning and apply your skills in new ways.\n\nIn short, if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to be working with Visual Basic 2012, take the advice of your fellow developers: Save yourself some time and money by making this book your first choice for VB 2012 education and reference.\n\nWho this book is for\nThis book is for anyone who wants to learn how to use VB 2012 to develop Windows Forms applications:\n\n- If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never used VB before, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll start at the beginning but move at a pace that has you developing business applications in a minimum of time.\n- If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re new to the .NET environment, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to use Visual Studio 2012 and all of the great productivity tools it has to offer as you learn Visual Basic.\n- If you have experience with a previous version of Visual Basic, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll upgrade easily to VB 2012, focusing on the features and development techniques that are new to you.\n\nAnd even though the focus is on Windows Forms, the skills youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll gain will apply to any .NET applicationÃ¢â‚¬Â¦whether for Windows, the web, or mobile devices.\n\nTable of Contents\nSection 1: Introduction to Visual Basic programming\nChapter 1.
