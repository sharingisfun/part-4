In this course, Jack starts out with the basics of understanding light and recognizing what that light is doing inside the photograph. The best way to learn lighting is to start with a single light and learn how to manipulate it. Jack wants to teach photographers how to affect the quantity of light without affecting the quality. Some of the techniques covered in this course include; positioning a large soft box, simulating sunlight in the studio, using nets, reflectors, and gobos, beauty light, and how to change the temperature of the light. This is a great course for photographers who are just getting started in the studio. Some advice from Jack - don't be afraid to make mistakes. It just means you are learning.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b82e1b4b32a8d81502e49f67fab03af11d442bf4","amp;dn":"Kelby+Training+-+One+Light+Lighting+%282011%29+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b82e1b4b32a8d81502e49f67fab03af11d442bf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,46,27,75,50,168,216,21,2,228,159,103,250,176,58,241,29,68,43,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
