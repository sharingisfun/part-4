SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s out to prove that Mexican home cooking is quicker and far easier than most Americans think.\nHer dishes are not blanketed with cheese, or heavy and fried, or based on complex sauces. Nor are they necessarily highly spicy. Surprising in their simplicity and freshness, they incorporate produce and grains. Most important, they fit perfectly into an everyday family cooking schedule and use just a handful of ingredients, most of which are already in your pantry. Many are homey specialties that Pati learned from her mother and grandmother, some are creative spins on classics, while others are not well known outside of Mexico.\nDishes like Chicken ÃƒÂ  la Trash (itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s delicious!), a one-pot meal that Pati gleaned from a Mexican restaurant cook; Mexican Meatballs with Mint and Chipotle; Sweet and Salty Salmon; and Mexican-Style Pasta can revitalize your daily repertoire. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find plenty of vegetarian fare, from Classic Avocado Soup, to Divorced Eggs (with red and green salsa), to Oaxaca-Style Mushroom and Cheese Quesadillas.\n\nAbout the Author\nPati Jinich is the host of the popular PBS show Pati's Mexican Table and the official chef of the Mexican Cultural Institute. She has appeared on the Food Network, NBCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Today Show, ABCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Chew, CBS, Fox News, NPR, and The Splendid Table. She hosts live programs for the Smithsonian Institute and has cooked at the Blair House, the official guest house of the vice-president.\nA self-described &quot;overloaded soccer mom with three kids and a powerful blender,&quot; Pati Jinich is on a mission to show the world that true home Mexican cooking isn't what they've come to expect. Pati was born and raised in Mexico City and comes from a family of accomplished cooks. She has resided in the Washington, DC, area for the past 14 years, where she and her husband are raising their three boys.\nPati didn't set out to be a chef. As a child, Pati could be found reading and dreaming of becoming a writer. She was professionally trained as a policy analyst with a graduate degree in Mexico City and later on at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. It was out of nostalgia for the foods she grew up eating in Mexico, and a few nudges from her husband, that she left her career as a policy analyst to pursue her passion for food. &quot;Into the culinary abyss, to start from scratch, with so many risks in site...,&quot; she reports having felt at the time.\nNow, with her first cookbook, also titled &quot;Pati's Mexican Table,&quot; she brings wholesome, simple Mexican meals into the homes of families everywhere. She acts as a tour guide and interpreter, telling stories about her homeland's history, evolution, and rich culture, while also sharing her upbringing, travels, and conversations with cooks across both her native and adopted countries. Furthermore, as a mom of three growing boys, Pati intimately understands the thrills--and spills--of cooking everyday meals for picky eaters and offers the practical tips and advice she's acquired during her many years of cooking professionally.\n\nCONTENTS\nIntroduction\nSalsas, Pickles, and Guacamole\nSalads\nSoups\nAnytime Vegetarian\nSeafood\nPoultry\nMeat\nSides\nDesserts\nDrinks\nAcknowledgments\nIndex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9975fc224ecdf347cb72ec73b1c1806bb0f47c2e","amp;dn":"Pati%27s+Mexican+Table+-+The+Secrets+of+Real+Mexican+Home+Cooking+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9975fc224ecdf347cb72ec73b1c1806bb0f47c2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,117,252,34,78,205,243,71,203,114,236,115,177,193,128,107,176,244,124,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
