For example, it use to be against the law for a slave to escape and the punishment was extremely harsh. In 1955 Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to sit in the back of a bus. Only 70 years ago, a citizen was considered a criminal if he/she possessed an alcoholic beverage (alcohol prohibition 1920-1933) and would be placed in jail. Our country used to deny women the right to vote. Fortunately, America decided to change these laws and stop classifying those who broke them as criminals.\n\nThe docile marijuana users of this nation are not criminals either just as those mentioned above were not criminals. Unfortunately 830,000 citizens are jailed each year (2006) for violating unjustified marijuana laws. This could happen to you and if it does, you will have to spend time in jail with violent criminals, pay a bond and hire a lawyer hoping you are not sentenced to a lengthy prison term. Many people will consider you a criminal which is very embarrassing and can be very damaging to your reputation. All of this can be avoided by watching Barry's videos. \n\n&quot;There's definitely some useful information in here (DVD), and I found it to be a fascinating insight into police thinking about drug interdiction tactics.&quot; --MarkDraughn, Blogger, windypundit.com\n\nMaybe you're in possession and don't know it\n\nDo you have friends that might use or possess illegal substances?

Not that I \nlooked real hard.\n\nThese were ripped from DVD copies, downloaded from\nThe Pirate Bay, using AutoGK.  Oh wait, I had to run \nNever Get Busted through something else (TMPGENC?) \nbecause the chapters were all seperated.
