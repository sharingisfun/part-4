Like Beach Fossils, Diiv's debut album Oshin was released by Captured Tracks and bears all the hallmarks of that label's quintessential sound: jangly guitars, winsome vocals, cavernous reverb, and an overall murky, underwater production aesthetic. However, Cole differentiates Diiv from the rest of the beach-pop pack with a darker, more eclectic feel that incorporates surf and Krautrock.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afdb83a6cbb7a47dc4cada4738f678a4d0475bee","amp;dn":"DIIV+-+Oshin+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afdb83a6cbb7a47dc4cada4738f678a4d0475bee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,219,131,166,203,183,164,125,196,202,218,71,56,246,120,164,208,71,91,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
