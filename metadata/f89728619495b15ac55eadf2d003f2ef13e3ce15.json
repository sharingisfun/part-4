In order therefore to protect I myself against any misunderstanding I have said Truth j and Non-violence is my creed. If I were asked to define | the Hindu creed I should simply say: search after Truth through non-violent means. A man may not believe even in God and still he may call himself a Hindu. Hinduism is a relentless pursuit after truth and if today ithasbecomemoribund, inactive, irresponsive to growth, it is because we are fatigued; and as soon as the fatigue is over, Hinduism will burst forth upon the world with j a brilliance perhaps unknown before. Of course, there- j fore, Hinduism is the most tolerant of all religions. Its i creed is all-embracing.\n\nYoung India, 24 April 1924\n\nCONTENT:\n\nPreface vii\n1. What is Hinduism? 1\n2.
