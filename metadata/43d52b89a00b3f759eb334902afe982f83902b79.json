His fate hangs on one phone call to his mechanic, 2000km away in the other direction. Meanwhile, Heavy Haulage driver Dion Fisher is massively behind schedule, he's got big troubles from breakdowns, wildlife and the authorities. And on a farm east of Perth, livestock truckie Joey Granich is getting ready for a 650km run through the West Australian outback with one of the most dangerous loads a truckie can carry - sheep. Unpredictable and unstable, rollovers are a constant threat.\n\nIf you see &quot;Hector&quot; on the end of a file it means I capped it.\nEnjoy, Gaz/Hector :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43d52b89a00b3f759eb334902afe982f83902b79","amp;dn":"Outback.Truckers.s02e02.PDTV.x264.Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43d52b89a00b3f759eb334902afe982f83902b79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,213,43,137,160,11,63,117,158,179,52,144,42,254,152,47,131,144,43,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
