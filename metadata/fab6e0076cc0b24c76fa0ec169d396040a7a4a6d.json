In Germany, the Nazi party's program of genocide against any and all perceived &quot;enemies&quot; is coming into full swing when the party begins a violent purge of homosexuals in its membership. Max (Clive Owen), a bisexual playboy, is attending an orgy thrown by drag queen &quot;Greta&quot; (Mick Jagger) and featuring a number of party members when the festivities are raided by the police; Max and his lover Rudy (Brian Webber) escape, but they are later arrested and sentenced to a concentration camp. En route to the camp, Max betrays Rudy and arranges to be given a yellow identification star, marking him as a Jew, instead of a pink triangle, which would signify him as gay; while the Jews are destined to be executed, gay prisoners receive even more brutal treatment from the guards. While incarcerated, Max meets Horst (Lothaire Bluteau), an inmate who proudly wears the pink triangle. Max and Horst fall in love with each other, and Horst's bravery leads Max to accept his sexual identity. Bent was released in two versions; the original cut was rated NC-17 for a sequence featuring strong sexual content, while a trimmed version was granted an R.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118698/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118698/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-8631&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-8631&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 704x384\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1744 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,28 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fab6e0076cc0b24c76fa0ec169d396040a7a4a6d","amp;dn":"Bent+%281997%29+Lothaire+Bluteau%2C+Clive+Owen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fab6e0076cc0b24c76fa0ec169d396040a7a4a6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,182,224,7,108,192,178,76,118,250,14,193,105,211,150,4,10,122,74,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
