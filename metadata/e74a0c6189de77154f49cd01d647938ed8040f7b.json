The movie focuses on three lonely souls: Hsiao-kang, a gay salesman of crematorium niches who wanders the city on his scooter; Ah-jung, a handsome street hawker of counterfeit designer goods; and May Lin, a struggling real estate agent. Hsiao-kang sneaks into a vacant apartment with a stolen key, takes a bath, and tries to slash his wrists. Meanwhile, May picks up Ah-jung and enters the same flat for a late-night tryst. As the film progresses, each character goes through the tedium of their lives: May waits in empty houses for prospective clients; Ah-jung hawks his wares while avoiding the police, and Hsiao-kang places fliers in anonymous mailboxes. All three use the unoccupied apartment at various times for their own needs without realizing the presence of the others, until Hsiao-kang and Ah-jung run into each other. After they both flee the place when May arrives, they develop an odd sort of friendship. \n\n  General\n      Complete name : vive.l'amour.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.46 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 52mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 860 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 52mn\n      Bit rate : 1 658 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 384 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.875\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.240\n      Stream size : 1.30 GiB (89%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 52mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 154 MiB (10%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109066/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109066/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nChinese audio; English, French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted at Karagarga by ladri1\n\nMing-liang Tsai - Vive l'amour (1994)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e74a0c6189de77154f49cd01d647938ed8040f7b","amp;dn":"Ming-liang+Tsai+-+Vive+l%5C%27amour+%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e74a0c6189de77154f49cd01d647938ed8040f7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,74,12,97,137,222,119,21,79,73,205,1,214,71,147,142,216,4,15,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
