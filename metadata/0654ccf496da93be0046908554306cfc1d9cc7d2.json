Insightful and funny -- well worth reading.\n\ndescription:\n\nUsing humor, compassion, and insight, the beloved and best-selling Anthony de Mello teaches us to welcome the challenge of knowing ourselves and living the &quot;aware&quot; life.\n\nabout the author:\n\nAnthony &quot;Tony&quot; de Mello (4 September 1931, Bombay, British India Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2 June 1987, New York City) was a Jesuit priest and psychotherapist who became widely known for his books on spirituality. An internationally acclaimed spiritual guide, writer and public speaker, de Mello hosted many spiritual conferences. He traveled to many countries to study and later to teach, most notably Spain and the United States.\n\n11 years after de Mello's death, in 1998, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, under the leadership of its Cardinal-Prefect Joseph Ratzinger (who later became Pope Benedict XVI), conducted a review of de Mello's work and released a lengthy comment expressing their theological concerns. While the group showed appreciation for many of de Mello's writings, some positions were found to be 'incompatible with the Catholic faith'. It was seen by many as an attempt by Rome to undermine the clergy in Asia and indicative of widening fissures between Rome and the Eastern Church. Despite the church's concerns, his works are popular, especially among those interested in Ignatian spirituality.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0654ccf496da93be0046908554306cfc1d9cc7d2","amp;dn":"Anthony+de+Mello+-+Awareness+%28epub%2C+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0654ccf496da93be0046908554306cfc1d9cc7d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,84,204,244,150,218,147,190,0,70,144,133,84,48,108,252,29,156,199,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
