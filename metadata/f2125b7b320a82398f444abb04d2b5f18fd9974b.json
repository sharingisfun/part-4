In a strange, almost supernatural communion with nature and animals along the way, Jin decides to move from her permanent hideaway among the rocks and rob a house where an old woman was bedridden. She steals food, clothes, money, and a book from the womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s granddaughter to practice her reading. But fate will make her fall into the hands of several irascible men who wanted to take advantage of her. Jin will manage to escape and show her good heart in two occasions and in two different ways: when she kills a suffering Kurdish man at his request in prison, and when she saves a wounded Turkish soldier. Having walked in circles, it was with huge sorrow that Jin returns to her origin place, the hideaway cave, just to find more devastating bombardments and a sad scenario of misery and war. \n\nRip Specs (DVD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Jin.2013.DVDRip.x264.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 651 Kbps\nLength            : 2.16 GiB for 1h 56mn 38s 33ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 2 200 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 428 (2.393) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 448 Kbps\nInfos             : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : tr\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : fr\n\nText #2           : VobSub\nLanguage          : de\n\nText #3           : VobSub\nLanguage          : tr\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2670226/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2670226/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Turkish and Kurdish\nSubtitles: English, French, German, Turkish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2125b7b320a82398f444abb04d2b5f18fd9974b","amp;dn":"Jin.2013.DVDRip.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2125b7b320a82398f444abb04d2b5f18fd9974b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,18,91,123,50,10,130,57,143,68,74,187,4,210,181,241,143,217,151,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
