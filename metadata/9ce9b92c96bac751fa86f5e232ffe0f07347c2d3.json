Few words pass between them, and a past family tragedy brings sorrow daily. On a rainy night, EyÃƒÂ¼p's boss Servet, a wealthy businessman who's entering politics, hits a pedestrian on a lonely road. He drives off and offers money to EyÃƒÂ¼p if EyÃƒÂ¼p will take the fall - probably a six-month sentence. EyÃƒÂ¼p agrees, and while he's in prison, Ismail wants his mother to ask Servet for enough money to buy a car. Servet, in turn, desires Hacer. How can this play out?\n\n\nLanguage: Turkish\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / Spanish / French","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ce9b92c96bac751fa86f5e232ffe0f07347c2d3","amp;dn":"Uc+Maymun+aka+Three+Monkeys+2008+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ce9b92c96bac751fa86f5e232ffe0f07347c2d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,233,185,44,150,186,199,81,250,134,245,226,50,255,224,240,115,71,194,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
