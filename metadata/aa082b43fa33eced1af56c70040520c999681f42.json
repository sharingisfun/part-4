This is just as cool as it gets. Ten-inch vinyl-disc replicas of Robert Johnson's Vocalion records, now at 45 RPM (instead of the original 78). And all put together in a 10x10-inch hardbound box set. These are without a doubt the most celebrated blues recordings ever. Sure, purists (and we're among them) would argue that there are many other blues recording artists who had as great an impact on the genre's evolution, but nobody can argue that Robert Johnson's output has been the most lasting, the most mythical, the most revered and certainly the most collectible of all blues recordings. This is as close as almost all of us will get to what it would feel like - and sound like - to have a Robert Johnson original in our mitts. And guess what? With the set limited to 1,000 numbered copies, these too are going to be as rare as hen's teeth someday soon. Original source material provided by Bruce Bastin Supply.
