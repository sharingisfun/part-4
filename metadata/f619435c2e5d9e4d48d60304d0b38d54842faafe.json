Jim Powell is the only one who seems to notice. During a family vacation research trip (which Jim forced his family to take), the plane they are in crashes into a lake during a storm. The family returns home safely, but doesn't seem to be any closer to each other. Eventually, Jim, Stephanie, Daphne and JJ discover that they have superpowers. Jim attempts to use his newly discovered invulnerability and strength to stop crime, but ends up being shot and injured by high calibre bullets and eventually ends up revealing his newfound powers to his wife, who has discovered that she has superspeed. They eventually reconcile and have a heart-to-heart talk, finally admitting that their marriage needs help. Meanwhile their daughter faces normal teenager issues, which are worsened with the arrival of her telepathy, enabling her to learn that her boyfriend is cheating on her. Initially distraught, she eventually accepts her new power. Meanwhile, JJ, who prior to the crash had a learning disability, suddenly becomes a genius.\n\nAnd that's just how it all begins. Seriously, this series is funny, exiting and emotional ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ so it has all the ingredients for really good entertainment!\nEnjoy\n\nEpisode List:\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_No_Ordinary_Family_episodes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_No_Ordinary_Family_episodes&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFormat :\tXviD\nFile size:  \t350 MiB avg. per episode\nDuration : \t43 min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t624 pixels\nHeight : \t352 pixels\nAspect ratio : \t16:9\nFrame rate : \t23.976fps\nAudio: \t\tMP3\nNr. of Files:\t20 + 1 KABLAM!!!Trailer +1 txt +1 Titlepic = 23\n\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original file names intact.\nThis pack wouldn't have been possible without you, we worship you,\n\n+++eztv+++TvTeam+++VTV+++scenebalance+++TorrentDay+++eztv+++\n\nAfter 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.\n\n\n######################  You like your show in one pack?  #######################\n##############################  Here you go!  ##################################\nVISIT THE KABLAM!!! at SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f619435c2e5d9e4d48d60304d0b38d54842faafe","amp;dn":"No+Ordinary+Family+-+Season+1+Complete+HDTV+%28XviD%2FMP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f619435c2e5d9e4d48d60304d0b38d54842faafe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,25,67,92,46,93,158,77,72,214,3,4,208,179,141,84,132,47,170,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
