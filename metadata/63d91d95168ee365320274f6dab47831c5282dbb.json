It was researched and compiled by a person known as JWB. He undertook a mammoth project, locating the best-available sources for all of this material, and mastering it, and getting it out there. I have to say that this is, hands down, the most impressive fan-created collection I have ever heard. It should be held up as an example of what an exhaustive retrospective or anthology should be like. 99% of the recordings are in stunning quality. You may never have heard some of these recordings in this kind of quality. All credit and thanks must go to JWB, who truly went above and beyond on this one.\n\nNow, under inspection, it was discovered that each of the tracks but one ran at a slightly different pitch. So they were all tuned to a digital keyboard. Phase and level correction was done. Clipping was undone. No further modifications were made to the recordings. To the best of my knowledge, these are the finest renditions of these tapes that you may ever hear, and I have many Stones boots of the same material. This puts many of them to shame. You will not be disappointed after hearing this disc.\n\n\n\nRemastered Edition\n\n01 Mick talks about bootlegs\n02 Baby What's Wrong\n03 Diddley Daddy\n04 Bright Lights, Big City\n05 I Want To Be Loved\n06 Roadrunner\n07 Come On\n08 Memphis, Tennessee\n09 Roll Over Beethoven\n10 It Should Be You\n11 Leave Me Alone\n12 My Only Girl\n13 Not Fade Away\n14 Wake Up In The Morning (Rice Krispies jingle)\n15 Andrew's Blues\n16 Route 66\n17 Cops And Robbers\n18 You Better Move On\n19 Mona\n20 High Heel Sneakers\n21 Stewed And Keefed\n22 Down In The Bottom\n23 Tell Me Baby\n24 As Time Goes By\n25 Blue Turns To Grey\n26 Around And Around\n27 If You Need Me\n28 I Can't Be Satisfied\n29 Crackin Up\n30 2120 South Michigan Avenue\n31 Down The Road Apiece\n\n*******************************************************\n\nThe Rolling Stones - 1965-1967 - Unsurpassed Masters Vol. 2\n(Studio FLAC)\n\nRemastered Edition\n\n01 Everybody Needs Somebody To Love (BBC session 3/1/65)\n02 The Last Time (BBC session 5/1/65)\n03 Oh Baby, We Got A Good Thing Goin' (BBC session 8/20/65)\n04 The Spider And The Fly (BBC session 8/20/65)\n05 Cry To Me (BBC session 8/20/65)\n06 Fanny Mae (BBC session 8/20/65)\n07 (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction (backing track 5/65)\n08 Looking Tired (ouattke 9/65)\n09 19th Nervous Breakdown (alternate mix 12/65)\n10 Paint It Black (backing track 3/66)\n11 Sometimes Happy, Sometimes Blue (demo 12/66)\n12 Yesterday's Papers (demo 8/66)\n13 Yesterday's Papers (backing track 8/66)\n14 Let's Spend The Night Together (backing track 11/66)\n15 Ruby Tuesday (backing track 11/66)\n16 Please Go Home (backing track 8/66)\n17 Get Yourself Together (outtake 8/66)\n18 Have You Seen Your Mother Baby, Standing In The Shadow?
