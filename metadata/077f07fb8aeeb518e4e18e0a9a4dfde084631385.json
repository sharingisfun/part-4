Lal Kishore, &quot;Electronic Circuit Analysis, Second Edition&quot;\nBS P--tions | 2008 | ISBN: 8178001667, 144166940X | 357 pages | PDF \n\nElectronic Circuit Analysis is an important component of the broad area of Electronics and Communications Engineering. Electronic Circuit Design and Analysis aspects are dealt with in this book. Learning these topics is very essential for any electronics engineer. A student must study the subject, not just for the sake of passing the examination, but to learn the concepts. \n\nIn this competitive world, to secure a job or to learn the concepts, proper effort must be made. This book is written WIth that motive. Any book written just for the sake of enabling the student to pass the examination will not fullfil its complete objective. Electronic Circuit Analysis is one of the fundamental subjects, which helps in I.C design, VLSI design etc.\n\nThis textbook can also be used for M.Sc (Electronics), AMIETE, AMIE (Electronics) B.Sc (Electronics), Diploma courses in Electronics, Instrumentation Engineering and other courses where Electronics is one subject. So students from Universities, Engineering Colleges and Polytechnics can use this book.\n-Author ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:077f07fb8aeeb518e4e18e0a9a4dfde084631385","amp;dn":"Electronic+Circuit+Analysis%2C2nd+Ed.+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"077f07fb8aeeb518e4e18e0a9a4dfde084631385","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,127,7,251,138,238,181,24,228,225,142,10,154,77,253,224,132,99,19,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
