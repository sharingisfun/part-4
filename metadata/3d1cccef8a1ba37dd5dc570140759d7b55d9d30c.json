We have too much email, juggle multiple remotes, and hack through thickets of regulations from phone contracts to health plans. But complexity isnâ€™t destiny. Sull and Eisenhardt argue thereâ€™s a better way. By developing a few simple yet effective rules, people can best even the most complex problems.\r\n \r\nIn Simple Rules, Sull and Eisenhardt masterfully challenge how we think about complexity and offer a new lens on how to cope. They take us on a surprising tour of what simple rules are, where they come from, and why they work. The authors illustrate the six kinds o f rules that really matter - for helping artists find creativity and the Federal Reserve set interest rates, for keeping birds on track and Zipcar members organized, and for how insomniacs can sleep and mountain climbers stay safe.\r\n \r\nDrawing on rigorous research and riveting stories, the authors ingeniously find insights in unexpected places, from the way Tina Fey codified her experience at Saturday Night Live into rules for producing 30 Rock (rule five: never tell a crazy person heâ€™s crazy) to burglarsâ€™ rules for robbery (â€œavoid houses with a car parked outsideâ€) to Japanese engineers mimicking the rules of slime molds to optimize Tokyoâ€™s rail system. The authors offer fresh information and practical tips on fixing old rules and learning new ones.\r\n \r\nWhether youâ€™re struggling with information overload, pursuing opportunities with limited resources, or just trying to change your bad habits, Simple Rules provides powerful insight into how and why simplicity tames complexity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d1cccef8a1ba37dd5dc570140759d7b55d9d30c","amp;dn":"Simple+Rules%3A+How+to+Thrive+in+a+Complex+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d1cccef8a1ba37dd5dc570140759d7b55d9d30c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,28,204,239,138,27,163,125,213,220,87,1,64,117,157,123,85,217,211,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
