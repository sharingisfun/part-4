For though bread baking has its sourdough, brewing its lambic ales, and pickling its wild fermentation, standard Western cheesemaking practice today is decidedly unnatural. In The Art of Natural Cheesemaking, David Asher practices and preaches a traditional, but increasingly countercultural, way of making cheeseÃ¢â‚¬â€¢one that is natural and intuitive, grounded in ecological principles and biological science.\n\nThis book encourages home and small-scale commercial cheesemakers to take a different approach by showing them:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ How to source good milk, including raw milk;\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ How to keep their own bacterial starter cultures and fungal ripening cultures;\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ How make their own rennetÃ¢â‚¬â€¢and how to make good cheese without it;\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ How to avoid the use of plastic equipment and chemical additives; and\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ How to use appropriate technologies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0afc7631365c48ed7822bbf5adb69bc62477f70a","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Natural+Cheesemaking%3A+Using+Traditional%2C+Non-Industri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0afc7631365c48ed7822bbf5adb69bc62477f70a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,252,118,49,54,92,72,237,120,34,187,245,173,182,155,198,36,119,247,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
