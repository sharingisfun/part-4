They get the same pop culture references, order the same Chinese food, and hang out in the same places. Unfortunately, Lea is reserved, Gabe has issues, and despite their initial mutual crush, it looks like they are never going to work things out.\n\nBut somehow even when nothing is going on, something is happening between them, and everyone can see it. You'll be rooting for Gabe and Lea too, in Sandy Hall's quirky, completely original novel A Little Something Different, chosen by readers, writes, and publishers, to be the debut titles for the new Swoon Reads imprint!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d0bd82b769814f162b42ec5429436ec2e9e3990","amp;dn":"A+Little+Something+Different+-+Sandy+Hall","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d0bd82b769814f162b42ec5429436ec2e9e3990","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,11,216,43,118,152,20,241,98,180,46,197,66,148,54,236,46,158,57,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
