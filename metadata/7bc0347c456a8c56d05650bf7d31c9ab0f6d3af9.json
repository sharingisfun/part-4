And more than 40 years after Pops's daughter Mavis spent a night in a West Memphis, Arkansas, jail at the behest of a racist cop, she still remembers the terror of the experience, as well as the counsel of Dr. Martin Luther King. \n\n\nThat episode is at the centerpiece of &quot;My Own Eyes,&quot; one of the most moving offerings on this collection of songs of racial struggle in the '50s and '60s, produced by guitarist Ry Cooder and featuring backing from the original Freedom Singers and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Throughout, the album proves both emotionally chilling and spiritually uplifting. \n\n\nOn J .B. Lenoir's &quot;Down in Mississippi&quot; and Marshall Jones's &quot;In the Mississippi River,&quot; for example, Cooder makes fine use of pounding percussion and snaky electric guitar to capture the danger and fear inherent in the Deep South at the time, while the title song and &quot;Jesus Is on the Main Line&quot; draw on gospel and the traditional framework of church hymns to promise positive solutions. \n\n\nStaples, who ad-libs on several cuts, connecting the injustice of yesterday to the continuing marginalization of blacks in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, remains a remarkable performer, employing a throaty sensuality that rises from a deep well of tremulous emotion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist -\n\n\n\n      01 Down in Mississippi\n      02 Eyes on the Prize\n      03 We Shall Not Be Moved\n      04 In the Mississippi River\n      05 On My Way\n      06 This Little Light of Mine\n      07 99 and a Half\n      08 My Own Eyes\n      09 Turn Me Around\n      10 We'll Never Turn Back\n      11 I'll Be Rested\n      12 Jesus Is on the Main Line","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bc0347c456a8c56d05650bf7d31c9ab0f6d3af9","amp;dn":"Mavis+Staples+-+We%5C%27ll+Never+Turn+Back+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bc0347c456a8c56d05650bf7d31c9ab0f6d3af9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,192,52,124,69,106,140,86,208,86,80,191,125,49,201,171,15,109,58,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
