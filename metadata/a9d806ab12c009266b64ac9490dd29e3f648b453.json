This gives you insight into circuit operation like no equation does.\n\nWhile simulation is running, adjust circuit parameters with analog knob, and the circuit responds to your actions in real time. You can even generate an arbitrary input signal with your finger!\n\nThat's interactivity and innovation you can't find in best SPICE tools for PC like Multisim, LTspice, OrCad or PSpice (trademarks belong to their respective owners).\n\nEveryCircuit is not just an eye candy. Under the hood it packs custom-built simulation engine optimized for interactive mobile use, serious numerical methods, and realistic device models. In short, Ohm's law, Kirchhoff's current and voltage laws, nonlinear semiconductor device equations, and all the good stuff is there.\n\nGrowing library of components gives you freedom to design any analog or digital circuit from a simple voltage divider to transistor-level masterpiece.\n\nSchematic editor features automatic wire routing, and minimalistic user interface. No nonsense, less tapping, more productivity.\n\nSimplicity, innovation, and power, combined with mobility, make EveryCircuit a must-have companion for high school science and physics students, electrical engineering college students, breadboard and printed circuit board (PCB) enthusiasts, and ham radio hobbyists.\n\nFree version has limited sandbox area, but it can still impress you. If you need a larger playground, a full version is available. The full version will employ all of your imagination, and all the screen area of your tablet.\n\nThanks to Prof. N. Maghari for technical discussions, feedback, and help with designing circuit examples.\n\nFeatures:\nAnimations of voltage waveforms and current flows\nAnimations of capacitor charges\nAnalog control knob adjusts circuit parameters\nAutomatic wire routing\nOscilloscope\nSeamless DC and transient simulation\nSingle play/pause button controls simulation\nSaving and loading of circuit schematic\nMobile simulation engine built from ground-up\nShake the phone to kick-start oscillators\nIntuitive user interface\nNo Ads\nComponents:\nSources, signal generators\nResistors, capacitors, inductors, transformers\nPotentiometer, lamp\nSwitches, SPST, SPDT\nDiodes, Zener diodes, light emitting diodes (LED)\nMOS transistors (MOSFET)\nBipolar junction transistors (BJT)\nIdeal operational amplifier (opamp)\nDigital logic gates, AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR\nWhat's in this version : (Updated : Nov 17, 2014)\nPush button NC (normally closed)\nPush button NO (normally open)\nAdded contact resistance to relay\nRequired Android O/S : 1.6+","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9d806ab12c009266b64ac9490dd29e3f648b453","amp;dn":"EveryCircuit+v2.11+APK+%28Android%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9d806ab12c009266b64ac9490dd29e3f648b453","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,216,6,171,18,192,9,38,107,100,172,148,144,221,41,227,246,72,180,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
