Knopf, 2002).  Translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky.\n\nISBN: 9780375702242 | 656 pages | ePUB\n\n\nAfter his great portrayal of a guilty man in Crime and Punishment, Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821-1881) set out in THE IDIOT to portray a man of pure innocence and idealism. The twenty-six-year-old Prince Myshkin, following a stay of several years in a Swiss sanatorium, returns to Russia to collect an inheritance and &quot;be among people.&quot;  Even before he reaches home he meets the dark Rogozhin, a rich merchantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s son whose obsession with the beautiful Nastasya Filippovna eventually draws all three of them into a tragic denouement.  In Petersburg the prince finds himself a stranger in a society obsessed with money, power, and manipulation.  Scandal escalates to murder as Dostoevsky traces the surprising effect of this &quot;positively beautiful man&quot; on the people around him, leading to a final scene that is one of the most powerful in all of world literature.  THE IDIOT is both a powerful indictment of that society and a rich and gripping masterpiece. \n\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;Their trademark style fresh, crisp and faithful to the original (bumps and blemishes included) brings the story of nave, truth-telling Prince Myshkin to new life.  As is true of their other translations of Dostoevsky, this will likely be the definitive edition for years to come.&quot; -- Publishers Weekly\n\n___________________________________________________________________\n\n\nFor a collection of more novels and short stories by Dostoevsky, see:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9462331/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9462331/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aee24ff78580eba01a187341c67b867442bd1a86","amp;dn":"Fyodor+Dostoevsky+-+The+Idiot+%28Pevear+%26amp%3B+Volokhonsky%2C+trans.%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aee24ff78580eba01a187341c67b867442bd1a86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,226,79,247,133,128,235,160,26,24,115,65,198,123,134,116,66,189,26,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
