If you want to record your track, you can work with the formats MIDI, and WAV, as well as be able to work with OGG, MP3 and other formats. \r\nREAPER is able to easily control the volume level of your tracks, if it is too high no one bothers you slightly change this setting, as you can by moving to change the boundaries of the track you choose, if you are unhappy with the results, there is a multi-level rollback the system, but if you want you can re-execute the operation. \r\nREAPER has a nice interface, it in fact is not so difficult to understand, although the Russian support is not, think how you can register a development deal without me, like there is a batch mode. Specially add the program REAPER is nothing, it is easy to manage and the result can be quite high. \r\nDeveloper: Cockos Incorporated \r\nLicense: ShareWare \r\nLanguage: English \r\nSize: &amp; nbsp; 42.27 MB \r\nOS: Windows \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]How to Install:[/b]\r\n\r\n1).
