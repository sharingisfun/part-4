These five lengthy tracks (specifically, &quot;All of You,&quot; &quot;Stella by Starlight,&quot; &quot;All Blues,&quot; &quot;I Thought About You,&quot; and the title cut) put the emphasis on the lyricism of Davis, along with some strong statements from tenor saxophonist George Coleman and freer moments from the young rhythm section of pianist Herbie Hancock, bassist Ron Carter, and drummer Tony Williams. This hour-long LP complements the up-tempo romps of Four &amp; More.
