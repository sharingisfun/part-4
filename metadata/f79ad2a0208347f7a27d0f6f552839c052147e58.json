Throughout his career, he has introduced many novel concepts in the openings, and some of the systems he has introduced have gone on to become absolute main lines, such as the Rb1 Exchange GrÃƒÂ¼nfeld. Here he explains the methods by which he prepares his openings and works out new systems from scratch, and how readers can do the same.\nThe broad topics he discusses include Experiments in the Opening, Disturbing the Equilibrium, Strategic Planning, and Opening Formations. He follows this up with a section of examples from modern practice, and theoretical articles on several of the opening lines that he has pioneered, taking us through the creative process, and the highs and lows of the practical testing and refinement of the ideas.\n\nAbout the Author\nViacheslav Eingorn is an extremely experienced grandmaster from Ukraine. He played regularly and successfully in the Top League of the USSR Championship in the 1980s. He has represented Ukraine many times in team events and plays frequently in the German Bundesliga and open tournaments across Europe\n\nCONTENTS\nSymbols 4\n1 Experiments in the Opening 5\nl.l Transgressing the Rules 5\nl.1 Goals and the Means of Attaining Them 12\n1.3 The Battle of Ideas 22\n2 Disturbing the Equilibrium 30\n2.1 The Advantage of the First Move 30\n2.2 Drastic Measures 39\n1.3 Borderline Positions 48\n3 Strategic Planning 56\n3.1 Positional Assessment: A Dualism of Factors 56\n3.2 General and Specific Reasoning 65\n3.3 A Choice of Priorities 74\n4 Opening Structures 84\n4.1 A Problem of Our Own Choosing 84\n4.2 Secondary Variations 91\n4.3 Recurrent Opening Situations 102\n5 The Modern Game of Chess 113\n5.1 'Scientific' Opening Play: A School and its Crisis 113\n5.2 The Opening as an Accurate Move Sequence 120\n5.3 g4: A Symbol of Chess Progress 127\n6 A Theoretical Kaleidoscope 134\n6.1 Corrections to Theory 134\n6.2 The Chess Designer 140\n6.3 History of a Variation 147\nIndex of Players 157\nIndex of Openings 159","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f79ad2a0208347f7a27d0f6f552839c052147e58","amp;dn":"Creative+Chess+Opening+Preparation+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f79ad2a0208347f7a27d0f6f552839c052147e58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,154,210,160,32,131,71,247,162,125,15,111,85,40,57,192,82,20,126,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
