It is the trait, says Harold Bloom, of standing both of and above an age, the ancient principle that recognizes and hallows the God within us, and the gift of breathing life into what is best in every living person. \n\nNow, in a monumental achievement of scholarship, America's preeminent literary critic presents an unprecedented celebration of one hundred of the most creative literary minds in history. From the Bible to Socrates, through the transcendent masterpieces of Shakespeare and Dante, down through the ages to Hemingway, Faulkner, and Ralph Ellison, Harold Bloom explores the many parallels among his chosen geniuses and the surprising ways in which they have influenced one another over the centuries. \n\nAccompanied by revealing excerpts from their works that continue to astonish, enchant, and move readers, Bloom's insightful and spirited analyses illuminate and enlarge our common understanding of Western literary and spiritual culture . . . and offer us a grand yet intimate tour of it in one magnificent volume.\n\n\nReview\n\n&quot;Bloom, a distinguished and often controversial literary critic and best-selling author of numerous books about literature, explores the concept of literary genius through the ages by examining 100 writers. Aside from such 'must includes' as Shakespeare, Dante, Cervantes, Homer, Virgil, and Plato, Bloom offers some perhaps less well known to American readers, such as Lady Murasaki and Octavio Paz, acknowledging that his selections are idiosyncratic and were chosen because he wanted to write about certain authors, not because they were necessarily in 'the top one hundred.' In the introduction, Bloom posits a definition of genius that is fleshed out in his discussion of each writer. Authors are clustered into Lustres, or groups of five, while a brief introduction to each section explains why the writers in the section are associated with one another. (Each of the Lustres is based on one of the common names for the Kabbalistic Sefirot, which Bloom describes as representing God's creativity or genius.) Although the book is a delight to read, its real value lies in the author's ability to provoke the reader into thinking about literature, genius, and related topics. No similar work discusses literary genius in this way or covers this many writers.&quot; -- Library Journal\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61993c6f9e5bea78876602b9cecdd3adab54e9e6","amp;dn":"Harold+Bloom+-+Genius%3A+100+Exemplary+Creative+Minds+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61993c6f9e5bea78876602b9cecdd3adab54e9e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,153,60,111,158,91,234,120,135,102,2,185,206,205,211,173,171,84,233,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
