Burgeoning information has deluged the generalist and placed increasing reliance on the specialist. Predictably, this has led to the evolution of a team approach, but this does not assist the novice in critical care, with little practical and relevant information available on learning specific procedures and best practice.\n\nThis new edition of Understanding Mechanical Ventilation: a Practical Handbook familiarizes physicians, nurses and respiratory technologists with the concepts that underlie mechanical ventilation. Physiological concepts are stressed throughout this book in order to address the specifics of mechanical ventilation, while currently accepted strategies for patients with specific disorders are reviewed in detail. Ventilator waveforms, airway humidification, aerosol therapy and the use of novel software-based modes of ventilation in the ICU are also included.\n\nThe emphasis throughout the book is on presenting material in a reader-friendly, practical style incorporating numerous figures and tables. In this way, it will be a vital reference to all involved in the management of patients requiring mechanical ventilation in the ICU.\n\nContent Level Ã‚Â» Professional/practitioner\n\nKeywords Ã‚Â» Ventilation\n\nRelated subjects Ã‚Â» Anesthesiology - Critical Care &amp; Emergency Medicine - Internal Medicine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91ede193249185017d59df21f67fe43b9c479a8f","amp;dn":"Understanding+Mechanical+Ventilation+-+A+Practical+Handbook+%282nd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91ede193249185017d59df21f67fe43b9c479a8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,237,225,147,36,145,133,1,125,89,223,33,246,127,228,59,156,71,154,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
