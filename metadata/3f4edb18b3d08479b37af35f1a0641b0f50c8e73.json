Unlike previous versions, it can not use the KMS-activated, if you are using a retail license. EZ-Activator gathers information about your state licensing to provide the best method of activation. It can automatically try to possible errors in the case of activation failure, and can undo all changes in the event of complete failure.\nIt automatically installs all KMS keys for your system attempts to activate only the license KMS, and if successful, sets AutoKMS automatically.\n\nAutoKMS: AutoKMS scheduled task, which will be automatically extended for 180 days KMS activation. Unlike other activators KMS, AutoKMS not working 24/7 or only at the last minute in the hope he will not let you down, and leaves no trace, except for the scheduled tasks, journal and executable. He's just trying to activate KMS licenses (which saves a lot of time if you have not-KMS licenses such as MAK or Retail active). It will run at startup, and then every 24 hours and try to activate the specified number of times (task schedule can not be changed).
