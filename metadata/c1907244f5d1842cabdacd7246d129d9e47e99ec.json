The fortunes of one of Bingtown's oldest families rest on the newly awakened liveship Vivacia.\n\nFor Althea Vestrit, the ship is her rightful legacy unjustly denied herÃ‚â€”a legacy she will risk anything to reclaim. For Althea's young nephew Wintrow, wrenched from his religious studies and forced to serve aboard ship, Vivacia is a life sentence.\n\nBut the fate of the Vestrit familyÃ‚â€”and the shipÃ‚â€”may ultimately lie in the hands of an outsider.
