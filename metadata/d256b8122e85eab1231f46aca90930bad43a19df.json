These recordings combine lateralized subliminal priming phrases as well as audible hypnotic suggestions to promote the onset of healthy sleep. If you have difficulty sleeping see your health care professional and then consider this audio CD as an adjunctive aid to promoting recuperative sleep. Unlike many audio offerings, these recordings are produced by one of the world's foremost experts on how to effect positive change in mental states. Dr. Budzynski used his background as an electrical engineer and many years of research and clinical experience as a psychologist to produce a series of audio recordings which combine priming, binaural beats, imagery, dichotic listening, and dual track recordings to enhance the delivery of potentially life changing messages to the subconscious.\n\nMP3 - 320 kbps - CBR\n\nSource: WebRip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d256b8122e85eab1231f46aca90930bad43a19df","amp;dn":"Hypnotic+Sleep+Program+with+Thomas+Budzynski+%5BMP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d256b8122e85eab1231f46aca90930bad43a19df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,86,184,18,46,133,234,177,35,31,70,172,169,9,48,186,212,58,25,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
