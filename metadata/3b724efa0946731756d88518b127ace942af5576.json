As with the other volumes in the Time-Life series, this book has wonderful photographs and images from the Civil War period. I would recommend this book to people with little or no previous reading on Lincoln's assassination","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b724efa0946731756d88518b127ace942af5576","amp;dn":"The+Assassination-Death+of+the+President+%28Time-Life+Civil+War%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b724efa0946731756d88518b127ace942af5576","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,114,78,250,9,70,115,23,86,216,133,24,177,39,172,233,66,175,85,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
