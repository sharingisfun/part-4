Hornfischer\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nFrom the mountains of Afghanistan to urban sniper hides in Iraq, Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell has seen the worst of war at the sharp end of battle. In 2006, the &quot;lone survivor&quot; of Operation Redwing returned to combat as a member of SEAL Team 5 to help take on the most dangerous city in the world: Ramadi, the capital of war-torn Anbar Province. It was there that he took part in what has been called the greatest victory in the history of the U.S. Special Operations forces.\n\nLuttrell's eye-opening narrative also offers powerful new details about his time in Afghanistan and his miraculous rescue. After returning from that star-crossed mission with shattered bones and a broken heart, he thought of the men who had given their lives to save him-and how he would have readily done the same for them. He wondered why he and others, from America's founding to today, had been willing to sacrifice everything-including themselves-for the sake of family, nation, and freedom. \n\nA thrilling war story, Service is also a profoundly moving tribute to the warrior brotherhood and to the belief that nobody goes it alone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c7a0194b5511b35b4d61fc275d3ac660287ad48","amp;dn":"Service%3A+A+Navy+SEAL+at+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c7a0194b5511b35b4d61fc275d3ac660287ad48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,122,1,148,181,81,27,53,180,214,31,194,117,211,172,102,2,135,173,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
