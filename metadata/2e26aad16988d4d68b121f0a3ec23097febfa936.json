Dark and portentous, Edwards broods over his songs, ensuring that the shadows are dark and long. The mood isn&amp;#039;t a million miles from a lot of Nick Cave&amp;#039;s work, although the acoustic textures (electric guitar occurs sparingly on a few tracks) tend to diminish the impact a little. What&amp;#039;s certainly outstanding is his feel throughout, especially on a cover of &quot;Ain&amp;#039;t No Sunshine&quot; where the golden orb rarely gets a peek in. &quot;Arrow Head&quot; starts with an Appalachian nod to a Celtic past before heading through as white gospel church, then down the holler to the graveyard, and the striking opener, &quot;The Good Hand,&quot; lays out Edwards&amp;#039; musical manifesto with an almost funereal grace. It&amp;#039;s good, often very good, but it could have been better if Edwards had been willing to let a few more chinks of light into the hermetic world ? and also a greater variety of instruments. He&amp;#039;s a strong mandolin player, but it often doesn&amp;#039;t suit the mood he&amp;#039;s trying to convey. Still, it&amp;#039;s worth repeated hearings \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e26aad16988d4d68b121f0a3ec23097febfa936","amp;dn":"Woven+Hand+-+Woven+Hand+%282002%29+%5B192%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e26aad16988d4d68b121f0a3ec23097febfa936","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,38,170,209,105,136,212,214,139,18,31,10,62,194,48,151,254,191,169,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
