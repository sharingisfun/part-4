Anyone interestaed in forming unique parts or limited series sheet metal products will find a wealth of information. Anybody interested in Aircraft construction and repair, automotive prototypes, racing cars and compond-curve fabrication will find this book of extreme interest.\nDid you ever wonder how those beautiful streamlined surfaces on boats, yachts, aircraft and racing cars are made today? There are two possible answers: fiberglass or sheet metal. I can guarantee that skilled craftsmen can produce those beautiful forms, faster, stronger and cheaper with metal than with fiberglass!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6bdfb18a7b9848e3e8fbf3afd33fdd6c137f0ab","amp;dn":"Sheet+Metal+Handbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6bdfb18a7b9848e3e8fbf3afd33fdd6c137f0ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,189,251,24,167,185,132,142,62,143,191,58,253,51,253,214,193,55,240,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
