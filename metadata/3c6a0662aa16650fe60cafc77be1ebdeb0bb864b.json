So don't worry if the music doesn't sound perfectly natural and if you feel some kind of 'FM sound', it's normal and inevitable.\n[*] Secondly, most of the stations are separated into tracks, but some weren't, so I didn't cut them up, I left the mix ; it's the case for Soulwax FM, FlyLo FM, Worlwide fM (2 tracks) and East Los FM.\n[*] In order for the anchorman to speak flawlessly within the tracks, some intros and outros are shortened. I don't think there's any original edit here.\n[*] I couldn't convert the anchorman's interventions seperately, so you'll only hear him in the mixes.\n\nFinally, I added all the advertisments and all the news randomly played on the radio stations. \n\nAll tracks are tagged and folder pictures are included.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c6a0662aa16650fe60cafc77be1ebdeb0bb864b","amp;dn":"Grand+Theft+Auto+V+%28GTA+5%29+-+Xbox360+%26amp%3B+PS3+OST+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c6a0662aa16650fe60cafc77be1ebdeb0bb864b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,106,6,98,170,22,101,15,230,12,175,199,123,225,235,222,176,187,134,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
