Jackson, a cute, lanky, blue-haired poet who works in a record store, is at the center of Everett Lewis' twisted black LA comedy. He's got a crush on the sexy young blonde, Billy, who he met at an orgy the other night. But Billy's not into him ^Ãƒâ€“ he's in love with Sonny, a musician into SM. And although Billy doesn't want Jackson, two other guys do: Derek, a clean-cut record store customer, and Sam, the straight record store owner. Into this mix is thrown Jed, Jackson's hunky cousin, which leads Jackson to seriously contemplate the technicalities of incest. Before he can do anything about it, though, Jed is seduced by Jackson's lesbian artist friend. What's a boy to do?\n\n\n01:31:05\n552x400\n23.976 FPS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:730f2093fb8804412ced658362f56c46b8850c0f","amp;dn":"2002+Luster+%28USA%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"730f2093fb8804412ced658362f56c46b8850c0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,15,32,147,251,136,4,65,44,237,101,131,98,245,108,70,184,133,12,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
