Notoriously hard to prepare for, it's difficult to know what questions might be asked and how to answer them.\n\nExtensively revised, How to Succeed In Your Medical School Interview de-mystifies the interview process. It provides a systematic and methodical process which enables the interviewee to mine information from examiners, while demonstrating academic ability. Full of practice questions and free downloadable podcasts of mock interviews, this book offers tips on preparation, presentation, and most importantly, what to say.\n\nThe most significant addition to the book covers the multiple mini-interview system, which schools are beginning to use instead of the formal, fixed panel interview. This new system is made up of short &quot;stations&quot; ranging from 3-10 minutes, with a specific goal and a separate interviewer. The format can be a conventional interview question, a role play, linguistic skill test, writing exercise, or another challenge. The author has also added more graph-and-table data interpretation questions to the Oxbridge interview section and updated discussion material to include the current &quot;hot topics&quot; in medicine, such as e-cigarettes, medical ethics, and the US patent ban on genes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8570e0d46d6f69169a022c74b38e495b72189341","amp;dn":"Succeed+in+Your+Medical+School+Interview%2C+2E+2015+%5BPDF%5D%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8570e0d46d6f69169a022c74b38e495b72189341","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,112,224,212,109,111,105,22,154,2,44,116,179,142,73,91,114,24,147,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
