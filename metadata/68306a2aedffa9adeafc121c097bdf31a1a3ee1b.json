It includes &quot;What About Us&quot; and &quot;Repatriated,&quot; both of which have been unveiled by the band, though to my knowledge an actual single has not been announced as of yet. The album is set for official release on June 28, 2011. It's terrific, so enjoy it and don't forget to seed!\n\n1. When I Get Back (4:45)\n2. Damage (3:21)\n3. Bury Me Standing (4:09)\n4.
