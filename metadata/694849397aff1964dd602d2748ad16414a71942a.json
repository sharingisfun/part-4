rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executioners_from_Shaolin&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNow the movie itself is absolutely wonderful.\n It has the great Chen Kuan Tai playing one of the last disciples after their shaolin temple was burned down. The movie starts with an introduction of how Pai Mei became a traitor and decided to help the ching's. It show's the head abbot of shaolin in a duel with pai mei and show his special kung fu internal style. Externally is shown just as well.\n I honestly can't think of a greater actor to play the traitor of the ming's. So in the next fight we get the greatest cameo of gordon liu's career. I had actually forgotten that this guy is a great actor until watching this and shaolin challenges ninja again.\n    Now the action is made up of about 5 scenes. One after the other they get better and better but none surpassed the first 2 of the movie, the rest were just better because of the character development and the finale could not have been much better. Sure it could be bette in terms of speeds and superamn jumps but this is a hell of a lot more complex than your average kung fu tale.\n   So after chen Kuan Tai escapes(thanks to gordon) he goes in hidnign and travels with the peking opera on the junks. Now I will certainly not leave out li-li-li, the hottest woman in cinema history. She meets kuan tai and marries him and they have a son who is played by wong yue.\n I am not familiar and didn't like him al that much, but he more than fit the bill for his fighting. So when the junks are ordered to be burned, chen and lily go in hiding and he studies for YEARS in the tiger claw style to try and beat pai mei, and he constanty refuses to implement her crane style.\n Even after he gets defeated by Pai Mei and is sent home a miserable loser he won't try her kung fu. But I guarantee you will see an ending that is sweet and overall great execution throughout the entire movie that will leave you with a smile on your face(especially if yu are a fan of li-li-li).\n\nSCREENSHOTS:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Oct%202014/ExecutionersFromShaolin1977x264DVDripShawBrosKungFump4_thumbs_20141013_123609_zpsd3b8cb0d.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Oct%202014/ExecutionersFromShaolin1977x264DVDripShawBrosKungFump4_thumbs_20141013_123609_zpsd3b8cb0d.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis was personally encoded by me, Carjacker, from the Retail Edition DVD.\nLeave your thoughts/opinions and ratings on the A/V of this film for others to see.
