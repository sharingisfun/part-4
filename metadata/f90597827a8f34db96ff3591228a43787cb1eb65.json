It is a clean rip that doesn't require the Steam Client in order to start the game.\n\nIn addition, as many unnecessary files were removed as possible. The original Steam version includes several shared GCF archives that contain files used by multiple Steam games. Thus, once all the necessary GCF files are extracted, there are unused files included with the game. These files were removed to the best of my ability.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Single Player\n- Clean Rip from original Steam GCF files\n- Steam account\\CD-key not required\n- Standalone\n- Unnecessary files removed\n- 4.1 GB after installation\n\n\n\nThanks to hCUPa for SteamEmu 3.82, Bluntmann for the MASM Listing Tool, and to DigitalZone for their tutorials and awesome rips.\n\n-HorseDIC86","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f90597827a8f34db96ff3591228a43787cb1eb65","amp;dn":"Half-Life+2+Episode+Two+%5BNonSteam%5D+%5BUnnecessary+Files+Removed%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f90597827a8f34db96ff3591228a43787cb1eb65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,5,151,130,122,143,52,219,150,255,53,145,34,138,67,120,124,177,235,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
