That someone decided throwing people Quinn cares about into the line of fire in a cold-hearted act of self-preservation was a good idea. He also knows that this someone has made a serious mistake.\n\nBecause when Quinn gets mad, the last place anyone should ever be is in his crosshairs. He will not stop until the guilty pay.\n\nSometimes revenge is best served now.\n\nEPUB,MOBI AND TXT.
