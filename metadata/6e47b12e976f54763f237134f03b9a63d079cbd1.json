It will be released in multiple formats including 32-bit digital formats and cassette.[1] Recorded in 2010, it features Frusciante singing, playing all the instruments and engineering, as well as &quot;a few friends on vocals, mostly MCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ing&quot;.[2]\n\nFrusciante said of this album and its follow-up PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone &quot;I consider my music to be Progressive Synth Pop, which says nothing about what it sounds like, but does describe my basic approach. I combine aspects of many styles of music and create my own musical forms by way of electronic instruments. The tracks on Letur-Lefr are from 2010 and PBX was made in 2011. Letur is a compilation, a selected portion of music I made that year while PBX was conceived as an album, the songs having been recorded in succession. The records are very different from each other.&quot;\n\nTrack list\n\n1. \t&quot;In Your Eyes&quot;   \t\n2. \t&quot;909 Day&quot;   \t\n3. \t&quot;Glowe&quot;   \t\n4. \t&quot;FM&quot;   \t\n5. \t&quot;In My Light&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e47b12e976f54763f237134f03b9a63d079cbd1","amp;dn":"John+Frusciante+-+Letur+Lefr+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e47b12e976f54763f237134f03b9a63d079cbd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,71,177,46,151,111,84,118,63,35,113,52,240,59,154,99,208,121,203,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
