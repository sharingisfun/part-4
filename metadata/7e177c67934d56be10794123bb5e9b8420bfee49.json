He longs to trounce Robertoâ€™s Revenge, the stallion owned by his detested rival Cosmo Rannaldini, which means abandoning his racing empire at Penscombe and his darling wife Taggie, and chasing winners in the richest races worldwide, from Dubai to Los Angeles to Melbourne.\r\nLuckily, the fort at home is held by Rupertâ€™s assistant Gav, a genius with horses, fancied by every stable lass, but damaged by alcoholism and a vile wife. When Gala, a grieving but ravishing Zimbabwean widow moves to Penscombe as carer for Rupertâ€™s wayward father, it is not just Gav who is attracted to her: a returning Rupert finds himself dangerously tempted.\r\nGala adores horses, and when she switches to working in the yard, her carerâ€™s job is taken by a devastatingly handsome South African man who claims to be gay but seems far keener on caring for the angelic Taggie. And as increasingly sinister acts of sabotage strike at Penscombe, the game of musical loose boxes gathers apace . . .\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e177c67934d56be10794123bb5e9b8420bfee49","amp;dn":"Mount+-+Jilly+Cooper+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e177c67934d56be10794123bb5e9b8420bfee49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,23,124,103,147,77,86,190,16,121,65,35,187,94,155,132,32,191,238,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
