In 1977, Claudio Tamburrini (Rodrigo de la Serna) was a goalie for a minor-league football team when he was abducted by members of the Argentine military police and taken to an unofficial detention center on the false suspicion that he was a terrorist. Over 30,000 people lost their lives at the hands of Argentinean authorities under the military junta that ruled the country between 1976 and 1983, and as he was tortured by intelligence agents looking for information he didn't have, Tamburrini fully expected to become another victim. After many sessions of brutal torture, Tamburrini and his fellow captives Guillermo (Nazareno Casero) and Tano (Martin Urruty) were being readied for execution when, in a final desperate act, Tamburrini dove out a window during a rainstorm. Guillermo, Tano, and another man followed, and the four, naked and with noting but their wits, began a desperate run to freedom. \n\nFile Name .........................................: Cronica de Una Fuga.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,279,803,392 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:39:03\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 704x368 (AR: 1.913)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1581 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.244 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 129 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479354/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479354/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSpanish audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted originally at KG by damascus, whom we thank\n\nCronica de Una Fuga (Adrian Caetano, 2006)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c9a84900bb93eed03fc4d933f5490afbb48f091","amp;dn":"Cronica+de+Una+Fuga+%28Adrian+Caetano%2C+2006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c9a84900bb93eed03fc4d933f5490afbb48f091","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,154,132,144,11,185,62,237,3,252,77,147,63,84,144,175,187,72,240,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
