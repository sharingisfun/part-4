It was recorded live at Don Cornelius' Soul Train nightclub (named after his TV show) in early 1974. This album won the Grammy for Best Comedy Album for 1974.\n\nInitially released on Stax Records under their &quot;Partee&quot; imprint, the album's success was temporarily derailed by the sudden closing of Stax later in 1974. Pryor regained control of the master rights to the album and signed with Warner Bros. Records almost immediately; the album was reissued on November 10, 1975 on their Reprise subsidiary, three months after Pryor's ...Is It Something I Said? was released.\n\nThe comedy album found its way to Billboard music charts where it went #1 on its R&amp;B/Soul Albums chart for four weeks.\n\nTrack listing\n\n1. I Hope I'm Funny - 3:28\n2. Nigger With a Seizure - 5:24\n3. Have Your Ass Home By 11:00 - 2:30\n4. Black and White Lifestyles - 3:43\n5. Exorcist - 1:53\n6. Wino Dealing with Dracula - 2:11\n7.
