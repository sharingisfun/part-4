He next emerged on record on December 30, 1957, for a Pacific Jazz set with local musicians including his two brothers, vibraphonist Buddy and electric bassist Monk. Fingerpickin' is the debut album by American jazz guitarist John &quot;Wes&quot; Montgomery, released in 1958 and comprising tracks from sessions in 1957 and 1958.This CD reissues the complete album (which usually has appeared in piecemeal fashion) and finds Wes already quite recognizable. The pretty standard hard bop music (which usually features Buddy's vibes as the lead voice) is also of interest due to the presence of trumpeter Freddie Hubbard who at age 17 was making his recording debut; he sounds a bit nervous. In addition to this set, the CD has three songs from the one session that Wes made with his brothers' popular group, the Mastersounds. He actually appeared on the full album (a set of music taken from the film Kismet) but these are the only titles that include guitar solos. Although this reissue on a whole is not essential, the music is generally enjoyable and the CD will fill some gaps in one's Wes Montgomery collection.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01- Sound Carrier Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Wes Montgomery 06:55\n02- Bud's Beaux Arts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Wes Montgomery 07:31\n03- Bock To Bock Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Wes Montgomery 10:08\n04- Billie's Bounce Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Wes Montgomery 04:40\n05- Lois Ann Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Wes Montgomery 04:44\n06- All The Things You Are Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Wes Montgomery 03:57\n07- Fingerpickin' Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Wes Montgomery 02:30\n08- Stranger In Paradise Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Wes Montgomery 04:53\n09- Baubles, Bangles And Beads Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Wes Montgomery 03:26\n10- Not Since Nineveh Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Wes Montgomery 02:31\n\nPersonnel\n\nWes Montgomery Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\nFreddie Hubbard Ã¢â‚¬â€œ trumpet (tracks 1-4)\nWaymon Atkinson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tenor saxophone (tracks 5-7)\nAlonzo &quot;Pookie&quot; Johnson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tenor saxophone (tracks 1-4)\nBuddy Montgomery Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vibraphone (tracks 1-6, 8-10)\nJoe Bradley Ã¢â‚¬â€œ piano (tracks 1-5, 7)\nRichard Crabtree Ã¢â‚¬â€œ piano (tracks 8-10)\nMonk Montgomery Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass\nPaul Parker Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (tracks 1-7)\nBenny Barth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (tracks 8-10 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ab21b4db87e475bb3058a84da37ebc8e6b644fa","amp;dn":"Wes+Montgomery+-+Fingerpickin%27+%5BEAC+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ab21b4db87e475bb3058a84da37ebc8e6b644fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,178,27,77,184,126,71,91,179,5,138,132,218,55,235,200,230,182,68,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
