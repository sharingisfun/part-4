R. MartinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s magnificent cycle of novels that includes 5 books in total as of April 2013. I have uploaded the entire series in EPUB format, as it is the most compatible and view-able on all smart phones and mobile reading devices. \n\nHopefully you enjoy it, as I have the countless terabytes I have acquired through PirateBay over the years. Remember everybody, this site and others like it are a full circle, and only work with cooperation between all parties involved. So please for every 1GB of material downloaded try to, at minimum, give back (upload/seed) 0.5GB back to, because without someone seeding that latest episode of your favorite show last week, you wouldn't have it either. \n\n              *******LET US ALL GET SEEDY TO HELP THE NEEDY*******\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n\nThis series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy, bringing together the best the genre has to offer. Magic, mystery, intrigue, romance, and adventure fill these pages and transport us to a world unlike any we have ever experienced. Already hailed as a classic, George R. R. MartinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stunning series is destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction.\n\nA GAME OF THRONES\n\nLong ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of \nWinterfell, sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s protective Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to. Sweeping from a \nland of brutal cold to a distant summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of journeys. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, the fate of the Starks, their allies, and their enemies hangs perilously in the balance, as each endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.\n\n\nA Lokii_187 Production","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a54a59fd8e8ccf8e4396fcd26d1f5398ef1c8011","amp;dn":"EBOOK+-+A+Song+of+Ice+and+Fire+-5-+A+Dance+With+Dragons+%28epub%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a54a59fd8e8ccf8e4396fcd26d1f5398ef1c8011","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,74,89,253,142,140,207,142,67,150,252,210,109,31,83,152,239,28,128,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
