Whether covering Baghdad after the U.S. occupation, Sri Lanka in the wake of the tsunami, or New Orleans post-Katrina, she witnessed something remarkably similar. People still reeling from catastrophe were being hit again, this time with economic shock treatment, losing their land and homes to rapid-fire corporate makeovers.\n \n \nThe Shock Doctrine retells the story of the most dominant ideology of our time, Milton Friedman s free market economic revolution. In contrast to the popular myth of this movement s peaceful global victory, Klein shows how it has exploited moments of shock and extreme violence in order to implement its economic policies in so many parts of the world from Latin America and Eastern Europe to South Africa, Russia, and Iraq.\n \n \nAt the core of disaster capitalism is the use of cataclysmic events to advance radical privatization combined with the privatization of the disaster response itself. Klein argues that by capitalizing on crises, created by nature or war, the disaster capitalism complex now exists as a booming new economy, and is the violent culmination of a radical economic project that has been incubating for fifty years.\n \n \n \nIn this groundbreaking alternative history of the most dominant ideology of our time, Milton Friedman's free-market economic revolution, Naomi Klein challenges the popular myth of this movement's peaceful global victory. From Chile in 1973 to Iraq today, Klein shows how Friedman and his followers have repeatedly harnessed terrible shocks and violence to implement their radical policies. As John Gray wrote in The Guardian, &quot;There are very few books that really help us understand the present. The Shock Doctrine is one of those books.&quot;\n \n \n \n \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b69e5c735ce02f10a39f96216b6f5ba8720f1e30","amp;dn":"The+Shock+Doctrine+-+The+Rise+of+Disaster+Capitalism+-+Naomi+Kle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b69e5c735ce02f10a39f96216b6f5ba8720f1e30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,158,92,115,92,224,47,16,163,159,150,33,107,111,91,168,114,15,30,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
