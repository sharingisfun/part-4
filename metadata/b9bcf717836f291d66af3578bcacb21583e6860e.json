The primary goal of the game is to carry out a series of assassinations ordered by Al Mualim, the leader of the Assassins. To achieve this goal, the player must travel from the Brotherhood's headquarters in Masyaf, across the terrain of the Holy Land known as the Kingdom to one of three cities, Jerusalem, Acre, or Damascus, to find the Brotherhood agent in that city. There, the agent, in addition to providing a safe house, gives the player minimal knowledge about the target, and requires them to perform additional intelligence gathering missions before attempting the assassination. These missions include eavesdropping, interrogation, pickpocketing and completing tasks for informers and fellow assassins. Additionally, the player may take part in any number of side objectives in these open world environments, including climbing tall towers to map out the city, and saving citizens who are being threatened or harassed by the city guards. There are also various side quests that do not advance the plot such as hunting down and killing Templars and flag collecting. After completing each set of assassinations, the player is returned back to the Brotherhood and rewarded with a better weapon and then given another set of targets, with the player free to select the order of their targets.\n\n Sitting on a bench allows the player to blend in and avoid being spotted by guards.The player is made aware of how noticeable AltaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯r is to enemy guards as well as the current state of alert in the local area via an alertness level meter. To perform many of the assassinations and other tasks, the player must consider the use of commands distinguished by its type of profile. Low profile commands allow AltaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯r to blend into nearby crowds, pass by other citizens, or other non-threatening tasks that can be used to hide and reduce the alertness level; the player can also use AltaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯r's retractable blade to attempt low profile assassinations. High profile commands are more noticeable, and include running, scaling the sides of buildings to climb to higher vantage points, and attacking foes; performing these actions at certain times may raise the local area's awareness level. Once the area is at high alert, the crowds run and scatter while guards attempt to chase and bring down AltaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯r; to reduce the alert level, the player must control AltaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯r as to break the guards' line of sight and then find a hiding space such as a haystack or rooftop garden, or blend in with the citizens sitting on benches or wandering scholars. Should the player be unable to escape the guards, they can fight back using swordplay maneuvers.\n\n\n\nMinimum Configuration:\n======================\n\n  Operating System: WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP (with Service Pack 2) or Windows VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® / 7\n  Processor: Dual core 2.6 GHz IntelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® PentiumÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® D or AMD AthlonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ 64 X2 3800+\n  RAM: 1 GB Windows XP / 2 GB Windows Vista \n  Video Card: 256 MB DirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 10.0ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“compliant video card or DirectX 9.0ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“compliant\n              card with Shader Model 3.0 or higher (see supported list)\n  Sound Card: DirectX 9.0 or 10.0ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“compliant sound card \n  DirectX Version: DirectX 9.0 or 10.0 libraries (included on disc)\n  DVD-ROM: DVD-ROM dual-layer drive\n  Hard Drive Space: 8 GB\n  Peripherals Supported: Keyboard, mouse, optional controller\n\n\n\n\n* VIDEO OF THE TUTORIAL OF THIS GAME NOW AVAILABLE AT MY BLOG .\n\nhttp://\nglobe1.\nw o r d p r e s s . c o m /\n\n\n* WHILE WAITING FOR THIS GAME WATCH IN DIRECT LINK MODE THE ASSASSINÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´S CREED LINEAGE MOVIE IN THE NEXT LINK (COPY OR WRITE THE LINK TO THE ADDRESS BAR) :\n\nhttp://\nfliiby\n.com/file/\n825553/a8v4ttcdbx.html\n\n\n\n\n\n                              ***** enjoy ... *****\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9bcf717836f291d66af3578bcacb21583e6860e","amp;dn":"PC+%C3%82%C2%BB+ASSASSIN%C3%82%C2%B4S+CREED+1+Full+Game+directplay+by+globe%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9bcf717836f291d66af3578bcacb21583e6860e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,188,247,23,131,111,41,29,102,175,53,120,188,172,178,21,131,230,134,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
