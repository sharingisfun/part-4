An erotic mystery about power and sex, the entanglement of victim and perpetrator, and a man's struggle to regain his lost self.\nDaniel (Tom Long), a charismatic dancer, is drugged and abducted in an alley by three hooded women. They proceed to torture and rape him in an abandoned warehouse for about two weeks, before they take him in their car and dump him out. When he is left to return to his normal life, he loses his ability to dance and has problems relating with his environment. To reclaim his identity, he seeks revenge. He does so by hitting on every woman who responds to him hoping his abductors would be among them.\n\nReviews:\nThe Observer: This walks a thin line between pornography and seriousness as unsteadily as an inebriate trying to appear sober.\nThe Guardian: A psychologically intriguing film, which never quite adds up dramatically.\nBBCi Films: A lush, hypnotic waking dream.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424863/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424863/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOriginal release and screeenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/index.php?showtopic=389786&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/index.php?showtopic=389786&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFORMAT...........: MKV\nCODEC............: X264\nGENRE............: Mystery Romance Thriller Drama\nFILE SIZE........: 1.55 GB\nRESOLUTION.......: 720*412\nASPECT RATIO.....: 1.85 : 1\nFRAME RATE.......: 23.976 fps\nAUDIO............: 192 Kbps Ac3 (2CH)\nLANGUAGE.........: English\nSUBTITLES........: English - Italian Spanish - Dutch - Portuguese - Swedish - Danish - Norwegian - Finnish - Turkish - Croatian - Slovak - Albanian\nRUNTIME..........: 118 mins\n\nGeneric infos\nDuration 01:57:48 (7067.602 s)\nContainer matroska\nTotal tracks 15\nTrack nr. 1 video (V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC) {eng}\nTrack nr. 2 audio (A_AC3) {eng}\nTrack nr. 3 subtitle (S_TEXT/UTF8) {eng}\nTrack nr. 4 subtitle (S_TEXT/UTF8) {ita}\nTrack nr. 5 subtitle (S_TEXT/UTF8) {spa}\nTrack nr. 6 subtitle (S_TEXT/UTF8) {dut}\nTrack nr. 7 subtitle (S_TEXT/UTF8) {por}\nTrack nr. 8 subtitle (S_TEXT/UTF8) {swe}\nTrack nr. 9 subtitle (S_TEXT/UTF8) {dan}\nTrack nr. 10 subtitle (S_TEXT/UTF8) {nor}\nTrack nr. 11 subtitle (S_TEXT/UTF8) {fin}\nTrack nr. 12 subtitle (S_TEXT/UTF8) {tur}\nTrack nr. 13 subtitle (S_TEXT/UTF8) {hrv}\nTrack nr. 14 subtitle (S_TEXT/UTF8) {slo}\nTrack nr. 15 subtitle (S_TEXT/UTF8) {alb}\nMuxing library libebml v1.2.3 + libmatroska v1.3.0\n\nRelevant data\nResolution 720 x 412\nWidth multiple of 16\nHeight multiple of 4\nAverage DRF 14.496326\nStandard deviation 4.937745\nStd. dev. weighted mean 4.807746\n\nVideo track\nCodec ID V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nResolution 720 x 412\nDisplay resolution 888 x 480 (pixels)\nFrame aspect ratio 180:103 = 1.747573\nPixel aspect ratio 3811:3600 = 1.058611\nDisplay aspect ratio 37:20 = 1.85\nFramerate 23.976025 fps\nStream size 1,501,676,938 bytes (1432.110727 MiB)\nDuration (bs) 01:57:48 (7067.601982 s)\nBitrate (bs) 1699.786651 kbps\nQf 0.238994\n\nAudio track\nCodec ID A_AC3\nSampling frequency 48000 Hz\nChannels 2\nStream size 169,621,248 bytes (161.763428 MiB)\nBitstream type (bs) AC3\nFrames (bs) 220,861\nDuration (bs) 01:57:48 (7067.552 s)\nChunk-aligned (bs) Yes\nBitrate (bs) 192 kbps CBR\nSampling frequency (bs) 48000 Hz\nMode (bs) stereo\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4fc81461fda7cd20842ab45601112c835d3a231","amp;dn":"The+Book+of+Revelation+-+2006+-+Multisub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4fc81461fda7cd20842ab45601112c835d3a231","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,252,129,70,31,218,124,210,8,66,171,69,96,17,18,200,53,211,162,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
