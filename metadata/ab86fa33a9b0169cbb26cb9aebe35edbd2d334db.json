Introduces topology as an important and fascinating mathematics discipline to retain the readers interest in the subject. Is written in an accessible way for readers to understand the usefulness and importance of the application of topology to other fields. Introduces topology concepts combined with their real-world application to subjects such DNA, heart stimulation, population modeling, cosmology, and computer graphics. Covers topics including knot theory, degree theory, dynamical systems and chaos, graph theory, metric spaces, connectedness, and compactness. A useful reference for readers wanting an intuitive introduction to topology.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab86fa33a9b0169cbb26cb9aebe35edbd2d334db","amp;dn":"Mathematics+-+Introduction+to+Topology+-+Pure+and+Applied+-+%28Col","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab86fa33a9b0169cbb26cb9aebe35edbd2d334db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,134,250,51,169,176,22,156,187,38,203,154,235,227,94,219,210,211,52,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
