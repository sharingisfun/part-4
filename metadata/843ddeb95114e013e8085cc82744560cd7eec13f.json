The SONG REMAINS THE SAME...attests to the group s powerful and somewhat saturnalian appeal at the height of their popularity.\n- from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame s web page on the band s 1995 induction\nThe Hall of Fame s assessment of the legendary band also states, Led Zeppelin redefined rock in the Seventies and for all time. They were as influential in that decade as the Beatles were in the prior one...Then and now, Led Zeppelin looms larger than life on the rock landscape as a band for the ages with an almost mystical power to evoke primal passions. That power is communicated full-force in the updated, 2CD reissue of the soundtrack to their concert film THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME. First released in 76, the recording captures a celebrated three-night stand at NYC s Madison Square Garden in July 1973. The newly updated edition now contains six songs not featured on the original release, and the entire project was remixed and remastered with the band members direct oversight. Featuring liner notes by Oscar-winning director and former Rolling Stone editor Cameron Crowe, the set will be released simultaneously by Warner Home Video with the new, expanded DVD edition of the film.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:843ddeb95114e013e8085cc82744560cd7eec13f","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+The+Song+Remains+The+Same+%28Remastered+%2F+Expanded%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"843ddeb95114e013e8085cc82744560cd7eec13f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,61,222,185,81,20,224,19,232,8,92,200,39,68,86,12,215,238,193,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
