The same show will also be released on the same day as part of the box set Spring 1990 (The Other One). One of the songs from this performance, Eyes of the World, was previously released on the album Without a Net.\nThe March 29, 1990 Grateful Dead concert was the first of several to feature Branford Marsalis as a guest musician. In a 2014 interview, Marsalis recalled that Dead bassist Phil Lesh had invited him to play with the band for one song. I came up for Bird Song, and after the set was over,\nI said, Thanks for letting me play, guys. And theyre like, No, no, stay! Play the second half of the show. Well do Dark Star. That had no significance to me. Im like, Dark Star? Okay. What is it? Oh, youre gonna love it. Its free, its out. Great, I can play out. They start playing that lick, and the audience goes fucking bananas. Later, I started getting these phone calls on my private number: Man, you were great last night. Thanks for getting them to play Dark Star. They havent played it in six months. Im like, Who are these people?'\n\nThere was almost nothing [the Grateful Dead] couldnt playand make the shit sound authentic. When they played a song by the Band or Bob Dylan, they played it with the same spirit as the Band or Dylan. They didnt feel the need to write their own arrangement of it. They were all listeners. There is a point where musicians who establish themselves stop listening to music and start listening to their own rhetoric. The Dead didnt do that. It was obvious in the way they approached a song.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e434a2ec2f9e4b4b6e97087d4fa51bf45c57a8a7","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+Wake+Up+to+Find+Out+Nassau+Coliseum+1990+%282014%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e434a2ec2f9e4b4b6e97087d4fa51bf45c57a8a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,52,162,236,47,158,75,75,110,151,8,125,79,165,27,244,92,87,168,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
