We did our best to eek out a mix via verbal and emailed direction, thanks to the crew of surrogate ears on the other side. Letters From Exile is material written from a certain space, in a certain place. I felt the need to discuss the underlying socio-political, cultural paradigm as I saw it. I havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been able to watch the news too much recently, so IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not hip on everything going on. But inspiration of this sort is a kind of news in and of itself, and often times contains an urgency that precedes what happens. I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t imagine it not being relevant. Messages like these I imagine find their audience, or their audience finds them, like water seeking itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s level.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Ms. Lauryn Hill","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58810abffb0db6f6ee23eb9a7de7876b6d790a24","amp;dn":"Lauryn+Hill-Consumerism+%282013%29+128","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58810abffb0db6f6ee23eb9a7de7876b6d790a24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,129,10,191,251,13,182,246,238,35,235,154,125,231,135,107,109,121,10,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
