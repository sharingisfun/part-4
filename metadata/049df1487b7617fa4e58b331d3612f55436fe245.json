Hunting for \nmore and more information, seeking more and more cybertrophies every day, \nhe constantly looks for bigger challenges. When he breaks into the computer \nof a security expert and an ex-hacker, he finds one - and much more \nthan that.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Skeet Ulrich.\n=&gt;-Russell Wong.\n=&gt;-Angela Featherstone.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Joe Chappelle.\n\nAntitrust 2001.\nJust how far should one man go to stay ahead of his competition? Milo \nHoffmann (Ryan Phillippe) is a young and gifted computer software designer \nwho with his close friend Teddy is about to launch a high-tech start-up firm \nbased on Milo's inventive ideas in convergence, in which he's helping to \ncreate new ways for different forms of digital technology to work in harmony. \nHowever, before Milo and Teddy can get their company off the ground, Milo \nreceives a very tempting offer from Gary Winston (Tim Robbins), a \ntrailblazing genius in the digital world who has turned his company N.U.R.V. \n(which stands for &quot;Never Underestimate Radical Vision&quot;) into one of the \nrichest and most powerful computer firms on Earth. While Milo is sympathetic \nto Teddy's beliefs that computer technology should belong to the people and \nthat open source software is the most promising future lies, Winston has \nlong been Milo's role model in design and research, and Milo feels Winston's \noffer is too good to pass up. Milo and his girlfriend Alice Poulson \n(Claire Forlani) move out to Silicon Valley, and at first Milo thrives on \nthe challenges of his new position, and develops a close working relationship \nwith fellow designer Lisa Calighan (Rachael Leigh Cook). But Milo \nunderestimates the ruthlessness of the leading-edge software industry, \nand he soon learns there's a sinister undercurrent to Winston's drive to \nstay on top.
