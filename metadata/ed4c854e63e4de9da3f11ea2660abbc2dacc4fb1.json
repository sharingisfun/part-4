Kiss Each Other Clean is the follow-up to 2007's 'The Shepherd's Dog and his first album for the cult 4AD label following his departure from Sub Pop. Described by Beam himself as a more Pop-oriented record inspired by '70s FM radio, this looks set to bring his melancholy, literate songwriting to a whole new audience. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed4c854e63e4de9da3f11ea2660abbc2dacc4fb1","amp;dn":"Iron+and+Wine+-+Kiss+Each+Other+Clean+%5Bmp3-vbr-2011%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed4c854e63e4de9da3f11ea2660abbc2dacc4fb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,76,133,78,99,228,222,157,163,241,30,162,102,10,187,194,218,204,79,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
