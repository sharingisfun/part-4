Edited by Nahum M. Glatzer and with a foreword  by John Updike.\n\nISBN: 9780805210552 | 488 pages | EPUB\n\n\nTHE COMPLETE STORIES brings together all of Franz Kafka's stories, from the classic tales such as &quot;The Metamorphosis,&quot; &quot;In the Penal Colony,&quot; and &quot;A Hunger Artist&quot; to shorter pieces and fragments that Max Brod, Kafka's literary executor, released after the author's death.  With the exception of his three novels, the whole of Kafka's narrative work is included in this volume.Ã‚Â \n\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;[Kafka] spoke for millions in their new unease; a century after his birth, he seems the last holy writer, and the supreme fabulist of modern man's cosmic predicament.&quot; -- from the Foreword by John Updike\n\n&quot;An important book, valuable in itself and absolutely fascinating.  The stories are dreamlike, allegorical, symbolic, parabolic, grotesque, ritualistic, nasty, lucent, extremely personal, ghoulishly detached, exquisitely comic, numinous, and prophetic.&quot; -- The New York Times\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35941063f46a048069bebb2d3f4544cd0bae2e3b","amp;dn":"Franz+Kafka+-+The+Complete+Stories+%281983%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35941063f46a048069bebb2d3f4544cd0bae2e3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,148,16,99,244,106,4,128,105,190,187,45,63,69,68,205,11,174,46,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
