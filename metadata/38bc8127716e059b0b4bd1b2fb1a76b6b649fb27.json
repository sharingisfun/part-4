This book presents techniques for proving a variety of geometric results in three dimensions. Special attention is given to prisms, pyramids, platonic solids, cones, cylinders and spheres, as well as many new and classical results. A chapter is devoted to each of the following basic techniques for exploring space and proving theorems: enumeration, representation, dissection, plane sections, intersection, iteration, motion, projection, and folding and unfolding. The book includes a selection of Challenges for each chapter with solutions, references and a complete index. The text is aimed at secondary school and college and university teachers as an introduction to solid geometry, as a supplement in problem solving sessions, as enrichment material in a course on proofs and mathematical reasoning, or in a mathematics course for liberal arts students","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38bc8127716e059b0b4bd1b2fb1a76b6b649fb27","amp;dn":"A+Mathematica+Odyssey+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38bc8127716e059b0b4bd1b2fb1a76b6b649fb27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,188,129,39,113,110,5,155,11,75,209,178,251,26,118,182,182,73,251,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
