These special performances celebrated the two year anniversary of the Jimi Hendrix Experience and came just as the groundbreaking album Electric Ladyland was released. Winterland presents some of HendrixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most spectacular guitar work and the four CD set is filled with rare live versions of classic songs such as &quot;Manic Depression&quot;, &quot;Are You Experienced&quot;, &quot;Tax Free&quot;, and &quot;Little Wing&quot;. Fans will also enjoy HendrixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dramatic interpretations of CreamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;Sunshine Of Your Love&quot; and HowlinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ WolfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;Killing Floor&quot; with the Experience joined by Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady as well his rendition of Bob DylanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;Like A Rolling Stone,&quot; which has been selected as the lead track for this special release. \nThis special deluxe box set features never before released music from each of the six unforgettable Winterland performances. The new standard and deluxe editions of Winterland are markedly different from a single disc compilation, long out of print, that was briefly issued by Rykodisc in 1987 and 1988. The deluxe edition also presents a rare interview with Hendrix recorded backstage at the Boston Garden a few weeks after the Winterland performances. This previously unreleased bonus provides fans with a unique window into HendrixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s views about his background, his approach to the guitar and song writing and future direction of his music.\nThe bonus disc consists of recordings from Jimi's February 4, 1968 Winterland performance. These songs have only ever been available as part of the Dagger Records official bootleg Paris '67/San Francisco '68.\n\nTracklist - Disc 1: San Fransisco, CA. 10-10-1968\n01. Tax Free\n02.
