What if you could change it back? Stephen KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heart-stoppingly dramatic new novel is about a man who travels back in time to prevent the JFK assassination.\n\nFollowing his massively successful novel Under the Dome, King sweeps listeners back in time to another momentÃ¢â‚¬â€a real life momentÃ¢â‚¬â€when everything went wrong: the JFK assassination. And he introduces listeners to a character who has the power to change the course of history. \n\nJake Epping is a thirty-five-year-old high school English teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine, who makes extra money teaching adults in the GED program. He receives an essay from one of the studentsÃ¢â‚¬â€a gruesome, harrowing first person story about the night fifty years ago when his father came home and killed his mother, his sister, and his brother with a hammer. Harry escaped with a smashed leg, as evidenced by his crooked walk.\n\nNot much later, JakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friend Al, who runs the local diner, divulges a secret: his storeroom is a portal to 1958. He enlists Jake on an insaneÃ¢â‚¬â€and insanely impossibleÃ¢â‚¬â€mission to try to prevent the Kennedy assassination. So begins JakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new life as George Amberson and his new world of Elvis and JFK, of big American cars and sock hops, of a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald and a beautiful high school librarian named Sadie Dunhill, who becomes the love of JackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€a life that transgresses all the normal rules of time. \n\nA tribute to a simpler era and a devastating exercise in escalating suspense, 11/22/63 is Stephen King at his epic best.\n\nMP3 CD\nPublisher: Simon &amp; Schuster Audio; Unabridged edition (November 8, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 144234430X\nISBN-13: 978-1442344303\n\nCraig Wasson (Reader)\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
