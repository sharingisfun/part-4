There is no cure. In a few days 90 percent of its victims are dead. A secret military SWAT team of soldiers and scientists is mobilized to stop the outbreak of this exotic &quot;hot&quot; virus. The Hot Zone tells this dramatic story, giving a hair-raising account of the\nappearance of rare and lethal viruses and their &quot;crashes&quot; into the human race.
