This collection brings together both sides of all the singles he released through the RPM and Chess labels during the first hugely important decade of his career, along with bonus tracks comprising recordings made at sessions during this period which were not released as singles at the time. Its a great-value 80-track 3-CD set, which showcases one of the major personalities of the blues.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[/center]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b6898b5e77fc37229d03eb7f9d5d7c7cfe3c4e4","amp;dn":"Howlin+Wolf+-+The+Complete+RPM+And+Chess+Singles+%282014%29+MP3%40320k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b6898b5e77fc37229d03eb7f9d5d7c7cfe3c4e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,104,152,181,231,127,195,114,41,208,62,183,249,213,215,199,207,227,196,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
