G. Jones\n\nWesley Gibson is a loser cubicle rat who is abused by almost everyone in his life, including his female overweight boss, a local Latino gang, his adulterous girlfriend, and his best friend with whom his girlfriend is having an affair. Wesley was raised by his pacifist mother after they were abandoned by his father, causing him to grow up into a wimp. All this changes when he is visited by the Fox, an assassin who shoots everyone in a sandwich shop before revealing herself to be a member of the Fraternity, a powerful organization of supervillains that rules the world. So long as they maintain secrecy, they are able to commit any crime without any consequences. The Fraternity wishes to recruit Wesley to replace his father, a supervillain known as the Killer, who was killed by an unknown assassin.\n\nAll credits go to the group who uploaded these\n\nHope you enjoy it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc73c05951901917baf1b881d2bb0d0e96bda8f9","amp;dn":"Wanted+by+Mark+Millar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc73c05951901917baf1b881d2bb0d0e96bda8f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,115,192,89,81,144,25,23,186,241,184,129,210,187,13,14,150,189,168,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
