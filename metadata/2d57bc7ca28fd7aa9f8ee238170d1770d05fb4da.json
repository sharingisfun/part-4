Each episode features a theatrical scene preceded by a title that lists the characters in the episode, its location, and a brief summary of the action. As he would throughout his career, director Jean-Luc Godard uses prostitution as a metaphor for both economic life in general and the position of the filmmaker under capitalism. Vivre sa vie stars Anna Karina, who was married to Godard at the time. Her performance was largely improvised as Godard refused to give Karina her lines until just before each scene was shot. In order to maintain the freshness of the performances, Godard rarely made more than one take of each shot. The film is shot in stunning black-and-white by Raoul Coutard. The improvised acting and fragmented story give the viewer the impression of watching a documentary about a woman's life that is also a series of essays about aesthetics and economics. In addition, the film's camera style presents a catalogue of alternatives to conventional shooting strategies.\n\nGENERAL iNFORMATiON\nRUNTiME.......: 1h:23m:50s\nSiZE..........: 5.47 GB\nViDEO.CODEC...: x264, 2pass, L4.1\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976\nBiTRATE.......: 9086 Kbps\nRESOLUTiON....: 960x720\nAUDiO1........: French AC3 1.0 @ 192 Kbps\nAUDiO2........: Commentary Vorbis 1.0 @ 80 Kbps\nSUBTiTLES.....: English\n\niMDB.LiNK.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056663/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d57bc7ca28fd7aa9f8ee238170d1770d05fb4da","amp;dn":"Vivre.Sa.Vie.1962.720p.BluRay.x264-CtrlHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d57bc7ca28fd7aa9f8ee238170d1770d05fb4da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,87,188,124,162,143,215,170,159,142,226,56,23,13,23,112,208,95,180,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
