As he struggles to unearth the origins of the program, he embarks on \na hallucinatory journey into a shadow world of right-wing conspiracies, \nsadomasochistic sex games, and bodily transformation. Starring James Woods and \nDeborah Harry in one of her first film roles, Videodrome is one of \nwriter/director David CronenbergÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s most original and provocative works, fusing \nsocial commentary with shocking elements of sex and violence. With \ngroundbreaking special effects makeup by Academy AwardÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®-winner Rick Baker, \nVideodrome has come to be regarded as one of the most influential and \nmind-bending science fiction films of the 1980s.\n\nCAST\nJames Woods              - Max Renn\nSonja Smits              - Bianca O'Blivion\nDeborah Harry            - Nicki Brand\nPeter Dvorsky            - Harlan\nLes Carlson              - Barry Convex\nJack Creley              - Prof. Brian O'Blivion\nLynne Gorman             - Marsha\nJulie Khaner             - Briley\nLally Cadeau             - Rena King\nSam Malkin               - Bum\nDavid Bolt               - Rafe\nHarvey Chao              - Japanese Salesman\nBob Church               - Newscaster\nJayne Eastwood           - Caller\nHenry Gomez              - Brolley\nKay Hawtry               - Matron\nRainer Schwartz          - Moses \n\nCREW\nDavid Cronenberg         - Director / Screenwriter\nClaude Heroux            - Producer\nMark Irwin               - Cinematographer\nHoward Shore             - Composer (Music Score)\nRonald Sanders           - Editor\nCarol Spier              - Production Designer\nPierre David             - Executive Producer\nVictor Solnicki          - Executive Producer\nDelphine White           - Costume Designer\nFrank Carere             - Special Effects\nRick Baker               - Makeup Special Effects\nPeter Lauterman          - Properties Master\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA REVIEW\n\nJason Boyberg \n(http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/12109/videodrome-criterion-collection/)\n\nA sterling example of David Cronenberg's signature mindfuck style of weird \ncinema, 1983's Videodrome is one of those films that tends to elude you \nregardless of how many times you watch it. It's the type of trippy fright flick \nthat confounds you even as it pulls you relentlessly forward with its disturbing \nimagery and gross-out watchability. At film's end, you're likely to rub your \nnoggin and frown and wonder whether you've endured a waking nightmare during a \ngreat portion of Videodrome's running time. Is the film a bloody indictment of \nthe effects of television violence? Or is it more likely a Cronenbergian comment \non the increasingly organic relationship between man and media, between flesh \nand technology, between the mind and the machine? It's likely a bit of all those \nthings, and even today, I'm a bit bewildered by the prospect of summing up this \nfilm in a few short paragraphs.\n\nJaded Max Renn (James Woods) heads up a tiny, independent cable TV station that \nspecializes in edgy softcore erotica and disturbing violence. Max is always on \nthe lookout for the next piece of provocative sleaze, hunting the airwaves with \nhis technical assistant Harlan (Peter Dvorsky) and searching the globe with the \nhelp of video freelancers like Masha (Lynne Gorman). When, with the help of \nHarlan, he stumbles on a fuzzy broadcast of something called Videodrome, which \nseems to feature graphic depictions of torture and murder, Max believes he's \nfound something significant, the type of aggressively offensive video that's \nperfect for his station. As he pitches forward into his investigation of \nVideodrome's origin, he becomes involved with self-help maven Nicki Brand \n(Deborah Harry), and we find, as their relationship develops, that both share \nsadomasochistic desires that feed directly into Videodrome's allure. After Nicki \ndisappears on her own quest to find Videodrome, Max finds himself experiencing \nincreasingly bizarre hallucinations involving his stomach and his TV. By the \ntime he meets Videodrome's Barry Convex (Les Carlson) and the elusive Brian \nO'Blivion (Jack Creely), Max is at the epicenter of a horrifying dreamscape, \nunder the sway of some kind of video-borne mind control. That's Videodrome in a \nnutshell, and yet there's no way to adequately convey the way this film burrows \nunder your surface and leaves you feeling as mind-altered as poor Max.\n\nIt's also difficult to determine at what point in Videodrome's baffling plot \ntrajectory that its events become merely fragments of Max's fractured mind. It's \na slow descent into an alternate pseudo-reality in which a huge console TV \nbloats with life and folds Max into a moaning, gasping, sexual embraceÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦in which \nMax's abdomen cleaves into a vagina-like orifice that will accept firearms and \nBetamax tapes at its sucking whimÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦and in which characters come and go, dead or \nalive, within the dream reality of Videodrome. Soon, Max is himself a \nbiotechnical weapon infused with malicious intent, and you're reminded of \nCronenberg's eXistenZ, the 1999 film in which the director returned to story \nduties for the first time sinceÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½you guessed itÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Videodrome. The two films make \nfor a striking double feature, offering up twin stories of bizarre hallucinatory \nmindscapes and body-obsessed horror, and they might represent the most powerful \nmanifestations of Cronenberg's statement on the sway of the mind and the flesh.\n\nYou're left puzzled by the outward events of Videodrome, and yet you feel an \nalmost visceral charge resulting from the onslaught of eroticized video-and \ntechnology-based imagery. These are truly images from out of your weirdest \nnightmares, made all the better by the fact that they're all practical effects \nrather than today's distanced CG imagery. These effects ooze with fleshy \nrealism, and you can almost smell their wet messiness. These effects, combined \nwith the film's zealous statements about media violence and technoflesh, start \nyour synapses firing, and you begin searching for meaning in the muck. You start \nthinking about what you're watching on cable, and you start wondering fearfully \nabout what's going on in the minds of your children when you catch glimpses of \ntheir zombified stares in front of the TV. And you think, Maybe it's too late. \nMaybe we're already under the influence of the very thing Cronenberg \nforeshadowed with that Beta-tape-in-James-Woods'-guts thing. Jokes aside, \nVideodrome remains a remarkably prescient endeavor, particularly to those of us \nwriting and reading this reviewÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½yeah, you, you purveyor and obsessor of \nvideo-based media.\n\nThe actors do an admirable job of bringing all this weirdness to pulsing life. \nWoods is oddly mesmerizing as Renn, our protagonist, and even as the things \nhappening to him get more and more outrageous, we're there with him for every \nmoment, eager participants in his psychotic predicament. Harry is a little \nawkward in one of her first acting roles, but there's no denying her masochistic \nallure. The bit players all share that weirdly stilted Cronenberg vibe, which \nfeeds into the director's peculiar oddities. Maybe it's a Canada thing.\n\nHOW'S IT LOOK?\n\nCriterion presents Videodrome in a beautiful anamorphic-widescreen transfer of \nthe film's original 1.85:1 theatrical presentation. This is really a gorgeous \neffort that belies the film's 21 years. Boasting a filmlike depth, the transfer \noffers a supreme level of detail, reaching into backgrounds. Sharpness is out of \nthis world. The film's color palette is very accurately translated, with no \nbleeding or smearing. Everything is quite stable. I noticed some fairly \nsignificant source grain in a few outdoor shots, but nothing to get too uptight \nabout. It's a remarkably clean print. Through a digital-restoration process, a \nlot of debris has been removed from the source print, but occasional dirt specks \nare in evidence here and there. Blacks are inky. This is an extremely satisfying \npresentation.\n\nHOW'S IT SOUND?\n\nThe disc's Dolby Digital 1.0 mono presentation accurately translates \nVideodrome's original audio track. Obviously, it's a center-focused affair, \noffering no engagement from the sides, but the fidelity is very much intact. It \nalso offers a surprisingly effective low end, particularly in Howard Shore's \nmoody, electronic score. Dialog is clear and accurate, if a tad over-processed \nin a few scenes. Criterion has done an admirable job cleaning up hiss and other \nimperfections while retaining the track's fidelity. Overall, this is an amazing \npresentation considering its mono source.\n\n(removed part referred to extras)\n\nWHAT'S LEFT TO SAY?\n\nCriterion hits one out of the parkÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½shall we say, out of the mind?ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½with \nVideodrome. This is a lovingly packaged and presented film experience, complete \nwith uncommonly fine video and audio and stimulating extras. Cronenberg fans \nwill find this set an absolute must, and all others should at least consider a \nblind buy of one of the director's very best works.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93bb5d900994db57bdfeeab356b7aa739f5aebab","amp;dn":"Videodrome+%28David+Cronenberg%2C+1983%29+%28Criterion%29+%5BRePoPo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93bb5d900994db57bdfeeab356b7aa739f5aebab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,187,93,144,9,148,219,87,189,254,234,179,86,183,170,115,159,90,235,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
