At a time when the blues were in and most vocalists (particularly vaudevillians) were being dubbed &quot;blues singers,&quot; Bessie Smith simply had no competition.\n\nIn the 1970s, Bessie Smith's recordings were reissued on five double LPs. Her CD reissue series also has five volumes with the main difference being that the final volume includes all of her rare alternate takes (which were bypassed on LP). The first set (which, as with all of the CD volumes, is housed in an oversize box that includes an informative booklet) contains her first 38 recordings. During this early era, Bessie Smith had no competitors on record and she was one of the few vocalists who could overcome the primitive recording techniques; her power really comes through. Her very first recording (Alberta Hunter's &quot;Down Hearted Blues&quot;) was a big hit and is one of the highlights of this set along with &quot;'Tain't Nobody's Bizness If I Do&quot; (two decades before Billie Holiday), &quot;Jail-House Blues,&quot; and &quot;Ticket Agent, Ease Your Window Down.&quot; Smith's accompaniment is nothing that special (usually just a pianist and maybe a weak horn or two), but she dominates the music anyway, even on two vocal duets with her rival Clara Smith. All of these volumes reward close listenings and are full of timeless recordings.\n\nBessie Smith, even on the evidence of her earliest recordings, well deserved the title &quot;Empress of the Blues&quot; for in the 1920s there was no one in her league for emotional intensity, honest blues feeling, and power. The second of five volumes finds her accompaniment improving rapidly with such sympathetic sidemen as trombonist Charlie Green, cornetist Joe Smith, and clarinetist Buster Bailey often helping her out. However, they are overshadowed by Louis Armstrong, whose two sessions with Smith (nine songs in all) fall into the time period of this second set; particularly classic are their versions of &quot;St. Louis Blues,&quot; &quot;Careless Love Blues,&quot; and &quot;I Ain't Goin' to Play Second Fiddle.&quot; Other gems on this essential set include &quot;Cake Walkin' Babies From Home,&quot; &quot;The Yellow Dog Blues,&quot; and &quot;At the Christmas Ball.&quot;\n\nOn the third volume the great Bessie Smith is greatly assisted on some of the 38 selections by a few of her favorite sidemen: cornetist Joe Smith, trombonist Charlie Green, and clarinetist Buster Bailey. But the most important of her occasional musicians was pianist James P. Johnson, who makes his first appearance in 1927 and can be heard on four duets with Bessie, including the monumental &quot;Backwater Blues.&quot; Other highlights of this highly recommended set (all five volumes are essential) include &quot;After You've Gone,&quot; &quot;Muddy Water,&quot; &quot;There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight,&quot; &quot;Trombone Cholly,&quot; &quot;Send Me to the 'Lectric Chair,&quot; and &quot;Mean Old Bed Bug Blues.&quot; The power and intensity of Bessie Smith's recordings should be considered required listening; even 80 years later they still communicate.\n\nThe fourth volume traces her career from a period when her popularity was at its height down to just six songs away from the halt of her recording career. But although her commercial fortunes might have slipped, Bessie Smith never declined and these later recordings are consistently powerful. The two-part &quot;Empty Bed Blues&quot; and &quot;Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out&quot; (hers is the original version) are true classics and none of the other 40 songs (including the double-entendre &quot;Kitchen Man&quot;) are throwaways. With strong accompaniment during some performances by trombonist Charlie Green, guitarist Eddie Lang, Clarence Williams's band and on ten songs (eight of which are duets) the masterful pianist James P. Johnson, this volume (as with the others) is quite essential.\n\nBessie Smith cut 160 sides for the Columbia and OKeh labels between 1923 and 1933, and the four previous two-CD/cassette box sets of her complete recordings released in the 1990s covered 154 of them, which introduces the question, what can a fifth two-CD/cassette box set contain in addition to the remaining six cuts? First, there are five previously unreleased alternate takes; second, there is the 15-minute low-fi soundtrack to the two-reel short St. Louis Blues, which constitutes the only film of Smith; and third, taking up all of the second CD/cassette, there are 72 minutes of interview tapes of Ruby Smith, Bessie Smith's niece, who traveled as part of her show. The box contains a &quot;Parental Advisory -- Explicit Lyrics&quot; warning because of the nature of Ruby Smith's reminiscences. You won't learn much about Bessie Smith's music from her niece's remarks, but you will learn a lot about her sexual preferences.\n\nTracklisting:\n\nVolume 1 - disc 1\n01 - Down Hearted Blues\n02 - Gulf Coast Blues\n03 - Aggravatin' Papa\n04 - Beale Street Mama\n05 - Baby Won't You Please Come Home\n06 - Oh Daddy Blues\n07 - 'Tain't Nobody's Bizness If I Do\n08 - Keeps On A-Rainin' (Papa, He Can't Make No Time)\n09 - Mama's Got The Blues\n10 - Outside Of That\n11 - Bleeding Hearted Blues\n12 - Lady Luck Blues\n13 - Yodling Blues\n14 - Midnight Blues\n15 - If You Don't, I Know Who Will\n16 - Nobody In Town Can Bake A Sweet Jelly Roll Like Mine\n17 - Jail-House Blues\n18 - St. Louis Gal\n19 - Sam Jones Blues\n\nVolume 1 - Disc 2\n01 - Graveyard Dream Blues\n02 - Cemetery Blues\n03 - Far Away Blues\n04 - I'm Going Back to My Used to Be\n05 - Whoa, Tillie, Take Your Time\n06 - My Sweetie Went Away\n07 - Any Woman's Blues\n08 - Chicago Bound Blues\n09 - Mistreating Daddy\n10 - Frosty Morning Blues\n11 - Haunted House Blues\n12 - Eavesdropper's Blues\n13 - Easy Come, Easy Go Blues\n14 - Sorrowful Blues\n15 - Pinchbacks - Take 'Em Away\n16 - Rocking Chair Blues\n17 - Ticket Agent, Ease Your Window Down\n18 - Boweavil Blues\n19 - Hateful Blues\n\nVolume 2 - Disc 1\n01 - Frankie Blues\n02 - Moonshine Blues\n03 - Lou'siana Low-Down Blues\n04 - Mountain Top Blues\n05 - Work House Blues\n06 - House Rent Blues\n07 - Salt Water Blues\n08 - Rainy Weather Blues\n09 - Weeping Willow Blues\n10 - The Bye Bye Blues\n11 - Sing Sing Prison Blues\n12 - Follow the Deal on Down\n13 - Sinful Blues\n14 - Woman's Trouble Blues\n15 - Love Me Daddy Blues\n16 - Dying Gambler's Blues\n17 - The St. Louis Blues\n18 - Reckless Blues\n19 - Sobbin' Hearted Blues\n\nVolume 2 - Disc 2\n01 - Cold In Hand Blues\n02 - You've Been a Good Ole Wagon\n03 - Cake Walkin' babies (From Home)\n04 - The Yellow Dog Blues\n05 - Soft Pedal Blues\n06 - Dixie Flyer Blues\n07 - Nashville Woman's Blues\n08 - Careless Love Blues\n09 - J.C.
