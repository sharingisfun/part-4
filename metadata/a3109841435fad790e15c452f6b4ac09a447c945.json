Soon thereafter, the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s original lineup was fleshed out further with the addition of guitarist Anders Hidle, bassist Rune ÃƒÆ’Ã‹Å“sterhus (who was recently replaced by Ole Vistnes), and vocalist Vibeke Stene (who has been replaced by Mariangela Demurtas).\n\nThe bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music is usually classified as gothic metal, due to its strong ties with the genreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s history in addition to the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s use of styles and traits stereotypical of the genre. However, they pride themselves on their musical diversity, as evidenced by the evolution of their music over the course of their five studio albums.\n\nTristaniaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s earlier albums WidowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Weeds and Beyond the Veil put a lot of focus around classical like female vocals, haunting choruses and classical instruments such as pipe organ, flutes and violins. The leading voice on many of their songs was the menacing harsh vocals of Morten Veland. The atmosphere is also achieved by quite unique sounding guitar effects.\nMorten Veland left in 2000 for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmusical and social differencesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to form the band Sirenia.\n\nWith the release of the World of Glass album in 2001, VelandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s growls were replaced by guest vocalist Ronny Thorsen from Trail of Tears, and clean male vocals were provided by veteran guests ÃƒÆ’Ã‹Å“sten BergÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸y and Jan Barkverd. Despite the new lineup and a slightly changed style that turned off some fans, the album received critical acclaim.\n\nAshes was released in 2005 with another change in members. Of the three male vocalists from the previous album, only ÃƒÆ’Ã‹Å“sten BergÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸y joined permanently, and is now accompanied by Kjetil Ingebrethsen doing the honors on growling vocals. The band took another step away from the sound of their debut albums and more into an experimental avant-garde style that sounds uniquely refreshing.\n\nThe Ashes Tour in Europe (minus Einar Moen, who remained at home to work on more material for the band, but is still an active member) brought about another change for the band, the addition of a second guitarist ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Svein Terje Solvang ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ who previously played with the band for touring purposes. His addition to the band as a permanent member in May 2005 marked the first time Tristania has had a two-guitarist team since Beyond the Veil.\n\nTheir latest album, Illumination, was released on January 30, 2007. Just one month after the release, Vibeke announced her departure due to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpersonal reasonsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nOn October 19, 2007, Italian singer Mariangela Demurtas (Mary) was announced as the new female singer. Before joining Tristania, she has performed with Reel Fiction and Alight.\n\nIn May 2008, Svein Terje Solvang left the band.\n\nOn February 22 2009, Rune ÃƒÆ’Ã‹Å“sterhus left the band and Ole Vistnes is the new bassist. Second guitarist Gyri SmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸rdal Losnegaard joined the band in late 2009.\n\nJust before the release of Rubicon (august 2010) it was announced that the bands line-up had more changes. ÃƒÆ’Ã‹Å“sten BergÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸y was replaced by Kjetil Nordhus] so the former could focus on parenthood and founding member and drummer Kenneth Olsson was replaced by Tarald Lie, because of a knee injury of several years.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3109841435fad790e15c452f6b4ac09a447c945","amp;dn":"Tristania+-+Studio+Discography+%281998+-+2010%29+320+k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3109841435fad790e15c452f6b4ac09a447c945","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,16,152,65,67,95,173,121,14,21,196,82,246,180,172,9,164,71,201,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
