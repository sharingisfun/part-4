Just another day in the Dilemma Prison. Rescued by the mysterious Mieli and her flirtatious spacecraft, Jean is taken to the Oubliette, the Moving City of Mars, where time is a currency, memories are treasures, and a moon-turned-singularity lights the night. Meanwhile, investigator Isidore Beautrelet, called in to investigate the murder of a chocolatier, finds himself on the trail of an arch-criminal, a man named le Flambeur...\n\nIndeed, in his many lives, the entity called Jean le Flambeur has been a thief, a confidence artist, a posthuman mind-burgler, and more. His origins are shrouded in mystery, but his deeds are known throughout the Heterarchy, from breaking into the vast Zeusbrains of the Inner System to stealing rare Earth antiques from the aristocrats of Mars. In his last exploit, he managed the supreme feat of hiding the truth about himself from the one person in the solar system hardest to hide from: himself. Now he has the chance to regain himself in all his powerÃ¢â‚¬â€in exchange for finishing the one heist he never quite managed.\n\nThe Quantum Thief is a breathtaking joyride through the solar system several centuries hence, a world of marching cities, ubiquitous public-key encryption, people who communicate via shared memory, and a race of hyper-advanced humans who originated as an MMORPG guild. But for all its wonders, The Quantum Thief is also a story powered by very human motives of betrayal, jealousy, and revenge.\n\nimage\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The good thing is, no one will ever die again. The bad thing is, everyone will want to.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nA physicist receives a mysterious paper. The ideas in it are far, far ahead of current thinking and quite, quite terrifying. In a city of Ã¢â‚¬Å“fast ones,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ shadow players, and jinni, two sisters contemplate a revolution.\nAnd on the edges of reality a thief, helped by a sardonic ship, is trying to break into a SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger box for his patron. In the box is his freedom. Or not.\n\nJean de Flambeur is back. And heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s running out of time.\n\nIn Hannu RajaniemiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sparkling follow-up to the critically acclaimed international sensation The Quantum Thief, he returns to his awe-inspiring vision of the universeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and we discover what the future held for Earth.\n\nimage\n\n\nWith his infectious love of storytelling in all its forms, his rich characterisation and his unrivalled grasp of thrillingly bizarre cutting-edge science Hannu Rajaniemi has swiftly set a new benchmark for SF in the 21st century. And now with his third novel he completes the tale of his gentleman rogue, the many lives and minds of Jean de Flambeur.\n\nInfluenced as much by the fin de siecle novels of Maurice leBlanc as he is by the greats of SF Rajaniemi weaves, intricate, warm capers through dazzling science, extraordinary visions of wild future and deep conjecture on the nature of reality and story.\n\nAnd now we find out what will happen to Jean, his employer Mieli, the independently minded ship Perhonen and the rest of a fractured and diverse humanity flung through the solar system.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:974f2bc200cd17ac3e7d48d10837cc1774987795","amp;dn":"The+Jean+Le+Flambeur+Series+1-3+by+Hannu+Rajaniemi+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"974f2bc200cd17ac3e7d48d10837cc1774987795","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,79,43,194,0,205,23,172,62,125,72,209,8,55,204,23,116,152,119,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
