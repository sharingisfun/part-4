Other products claim to have Ã¢â‚¬Å“bangin soundsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the best ever made blah blah, but they all fall short and have no more than 2 or 3 usable sounds. DW3 builds on everything we did right in dw2 that made music weapons one of the fastest growing music software companies in the world. With an all new 530 kit library of head nodding beat inspired authentic boom-bap hiphop flavor, a rebuilt high resolution audio engine, brand new Ã¢â‚¬Å“true analog technology, sp1200 and mp60 variations built-in, touchscreen compatibility and countless other new features make drum weapons 3 the most exciting hiphop plugin to come along since our flagship drum weapons 2. Unlike dw2 the kits in dw3 were created for dw3 and not as an afterthought. That has led to the library in itself being much improved and a touch more diverse\n\nDW3 still has the authentic hip-hop sound that you all love but it now has a more diverse collection of kits ranging from more modern types of hip-hop kits but still with gritty character, to off the wall insane kits, to our traditional boom-bap sound, to legit all the way grimey vinyl kits. Each kit now contains 12 completely different sounds, over 6500 sounds make up dw3. DW3 also has the exact same mappings of dw2 meaning you can seamlessly transition from dw2 to dw 3. The dw2 library will be ported into dw3 format and be available free for users of both, and also as an expansion for dw3. The touchscreen capabilities of drum weapons 3 makes the plugin future proof, and with our next version we will have the pads on the gui even transmit midi so you can use dw3 as hardware as well. There will be dw3 and 23in touchscreen bundles available as well. Overall drum weapons 3 builds on what made dw2 so popular and improves the library and adds alot of new features. In addition to each kit being meticulously ran through high end gear, here is a run through of dw3Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s features:\n\n- All Completely New 530 Kit Library.\n- 12 Different Sounds Per Kit, 3500 sounds total.\n- Touchscreen Optimized GUI.\n- All New Improved Audio Engine.\n- True Analog Technology w/ Classic Console and Tape Machines Sound.\n- Categorized WAV Collection Included Free (USE IN ANYTHING).\n- New Kits And Features Added With Each Update (Usually Monthly).\n- MP60 and SP1200 Variations Within Each Kit.\n\nMany thanks to the supplier, who wish to remain anonymous!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo not make money with this software...\n\nRemember to BUY the stuff if you USE it.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndemonoid.pw\n1337x.to\nthepiratebay.se\nflashtorrents.org\nbtscene.cc\ncastradio.net\nbtdigg.org\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXV (05)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff138a5715da82d104225c40ccf6e8cc9d3a5b23","amp;dn":"Music+Weapons+Drum+Weapons+3+v3.12+OS+X+%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff138a5715da82d104225c40ccf6e8cc9d3a5b23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,19,138,87,21,218,130,209,4,34,92,64,204,246,232,204,157,58,91,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
