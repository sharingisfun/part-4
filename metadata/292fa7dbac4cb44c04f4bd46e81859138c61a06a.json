Hackers can activate baby monitors to spy on families, thieves are analyzing social media posts to plot home invasions, and stalkers are exploiting the GPS on smart phones to track their victimsâ€™ every move. We all know todayâ€™s criminals can steal identities, drain online bank accounts, and wipe out computer servers, but thatâ€™s just the beginning. To date, no computer has been created that could not be hackedâ€”a sobering fact given our radical dependence on these machines for everything from our nationâ€™s power grid to air traffic control to financial services. \r\n\r\nYet, as ubiquitous as technology seems today, just over the horizon is a tidal wave of scientific progress that will leave our heads spinning. If todayâ€™s Internet is the size of a golf ball, tomorrowâ€™s will be the size of the sun. Welcome to the Internet of Things, a living, breathing, global information grid where every physical object will be online. But with greater connections come greater risks. Implantable medical devices such as pacemakers can be hacked to deliver a lethal jolt of electricity and a carâ€™s brakes can be disabled at high speed from miles away. Meanwhile, 3-D printers can produce AK-47s, bioterrorists can download the recipe for Spanish flu, and cartels are using fleets of drones to ferry drugs across borders.\r\n\r\nWith explosive insights based upon a career in law enforcement and counterterrorism, Marc Goodman takes readers on a vivid journey through the darkest recesses of the Internet. Reading like science fiction, but based in science fact, Future Crimes explores how bad actors are primed to hijack the technologies of tomorrow, including robotics, synthetic biology, nanotechnology, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence. These fields hold the power to create a world of unprecedented abundance and prosperity. But the technological bedrock upon which we are building our common future is deeply unstable and, like a house of cards, can come crashing down at any moment.\r\n\r\nFuture Crimes provides a mind-blowing glimpse into the dark side of technological innovation and the unintended consequences of our connected world. Goodman offers a way out with clear steps we must take to survive the progress unfolding before us. Provocative, thrilling, and ultimately empowering, Future Crimes will serve as an urgent call to action that shows how we can take back control over our own devices and harness technologyâ€™s tremendous power for the betterment of humanityâ€”before itâ€™s too late","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:292fa7dbac4cb44c04f4bd46e81859138c61a06a","amp;dn":"Future+Crimes%3A+Everything+Is+Connected+by+Marc+Goodman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"292fa7dbac4cb44c04f4bd46e81859138c61a06a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,47,167,219,172,76,180,76,4,244,189,70,232,24,89,19,140,97,160,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
