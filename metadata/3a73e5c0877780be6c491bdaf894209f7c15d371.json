RAR files can usually compress content by 8 percent to 15 percent more than ZIP files can. WinRAR is a powerful compression tool with many integrated additional functions to help you organize your compressed archives. It can backup your data and reduce size of email attachments, decompress RAR, ZIP and other files downloaded from Internet and create new archives in RAR and ZIP file format.\n\nWinRAR puts you ahead of the crowd when it comes to compression. By consistently creating smaller archives, WinRAR is often faster than the competition. This will save you disc space, transmission costs AND valuable working time as well. WinRAR is ideal for multimedia files. WinRAR automatically recognizes and selects the best compression method. The special compression algorithm compresses multimedia files, executables and object libraries\n\nFeatures of WinRAR:\n\n- Using WinRAR puts you ahead of the crowd when it comes to compression by consistently making smaller archives than the competition, saving disk space and transmission costs.\n- WinRAR provides complete support for RAR and ZIP archives and is able to unpack CAB, ARJ, LZH, TAR, GZ, ACE, UUE, BZ2, JAR, ISO, 7Z, Z archives.\n- WinRAR offers a graphic interactive interface utilizing mouse and menus as well as the command line interface.\n- WinRAR is easier to use than many other archivers with the inclusion of a special &quot;Wizard&quot; mode which allows instant access to the basic archiving functions through a simple question and answer procedure. This avoids confusion in the early stages of use.\n- WinRAR offers you the benefit of industry strength archive encryption using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a key of 128 bits.\n- WinRAR supports files and archives up to 8,589 billion gigabytes in size. The number of archived files is, for all practical purposes, unlimited.\n- WinRAR offers the ability to create selfextracting and multivolume archives.\nRecovery record and recovery volumes allow to reconstruct even physically damaged archives.\n- WinRAR features are constantly being developed to keep WinRAR ahead of the pack.\n\n\nWhat is new in Version 5.21\n\n\nVersion 5.21\n\n1. &quot;Drag and drop context menu&quot; options in &quot;Settings/Integration/\nContext menu items&quot; dialog allow to disable WinRAR archiving\nand extraction commands in context menu displayed after dragging\nand dropping files with right mouse button.\n\n2. If winrar.ini file is present in the same folder as WinRAR installer,\nwinrar.ini will be copied to WinRAR program folder after completing\ninstallation.\n\n3. While previous versions could produce RAR5 volumes of slightly\nsmaller than requested size sometimes, such situation is less\nlikely now. In most cases volume size equals to specified by user.\n\n4. Now by default WinRAR skips symbolic links with absolute paths\nin link target when extracting. You can enable creating such links\nwith &quot;Allow absolute paths in symbolic links&quot; option on &quot;Advanced&quot;\npage of extraction dialog or with -ola command line switch.\n\nSuch links pointing to folders outside of extraction destination\nfolder can present a security risk. Enable their extraction only\nif you are sure that archive contents is safe, such as your own backup.\n\n5. Bugs fixed:\n\na) WinRAR 5.20 issued unnecessary user account control (UAC) prompt,\nwhen running an executable from archive stored in UAC protected\nfolder. Since nothing is extracted to folder containing an archive\nin such case, UAC prompt is not needed;\n\nb) WinRAR could overwrite files with read-only attribute only\nwhen unpacking RAR and ZIP archive formats. Now it is also\nimplemented for other archive formats supported by WinRAR;\n\nc) &quot;Elapsed time&quot; and &quot;Time left&quot; were displayed incorrectly\nwhen applying &quot;Convert&quot; command to multiple archives\nand enabling &quot;Add recovery record&quot; option.\n\n\n\nSupported OS:\n\nWindows 7/8/vista/xp\n\n\nHomepage: \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rarlab.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rarlab.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nInstall Notes:\n\n1] Install the app.\n\n2] Copy the file 'RarReg.key' to directory C:/Programe file/WinRaR. \n\n\n\nDone you got the full version....\n\n\nTested And Working...\nScanned (With Kaspersky) And 100% Clean","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a73e5c0877780be6c491bdaf894209f7c15d371","amp;dn":"WinRAR+x86+%2832+bit%29+5.21+Final%2BKey+%7BTeam+EAT%7D+%28Alien%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a73e5c0877780be6c491bdaf894209f7c15d371","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,115,229,192,135,119,128,190,108,73,27,218,248,148,32,159,124,21,211,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
