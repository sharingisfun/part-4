The gallery-style format allows readers to see what artists collect, and the resulting spectacular artwork they make from it. The book will feature the collections and the artwork of thirty-five major mixed-media artists. The artwork will include journals, assemblages, altered books, as well as jewelry pieces, and detailed descriptions of the materials and techniques used, plus tips and insights into using unusual materials and collections.\r\n\r\nMixed-media artists are naturally collectors. They are fascinated by the stuff of life, and they are always looking for the right elements to add to their collages and journals. This book offers a juicy combination â€“ sort of a walk through an artist-filled flea market, and a gallery of the pieces created using these collections with tips and insights on collecting and creating, and how they go hand in hand.\r\n\r\nFeatures a lineup of 35 contributing artists including:\r\n\r\n- Lynn Whipple\r\n- Graceann Warn\r\n- Gail Rieke\r\n- Beryl Taylor\r\n- Keith LoBue\r\n- Michael DeMeng\r\n- Nina Bagley\r\n- Susan Lenart-Kazmer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e39b296a0e3c37e977ed1947635468075b9571b6","amp;dn":"Art+Making+-+Collections+and+Obsessions+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e39b296a0e3c37e977ed1947635468075b9571b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,155,41,106,14,60,55,233,119,237,25,71,99,84,104,7,91,149,113,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
