They were formed in 2003 by Liv Kristine, the former lead singer of Theatre of Tragedy and the entire line-up of Atrocity. To date, the band has released five studio albums, a single, six EPs, one live album and a DVD.\n\nMost of Leaves' Eyes lyrics, written by Liv Kristine, concern Norse mythology and the Viking Age. The melodic singing vocals of Liv Kristine are occasionally backed up by death growled vocals from Krull, identified under the vocal style Kristine refers to as &quot;beauty and the beast&quot;\n\nLeaves' Eyes stated that in 2015, they will release a new album, entitled King of Kings, and it will feature the London Voices choir and guest vocals by Simone Simons of Epica. It is their first release on AFM Records, after parting ways with their long-time label, Napalm Records. King of Kings is a concept album that centers around the sagas of Norway's first king, Harald Fairhair (Harald HÃƒÂ¥rfagre). In an interview with Sonic Cathedral webzine, Liv Kristine discussed her inspiration for the album:\n\n    The nicest thing for me is that it is said in the sagas that Harald became the first king of Norway, after he won a battle that took place in one of the Norwegian fjords called Hafrsfjord. You know, that is a very important place -- not only for the history of Norway -- but also for me, because I was born there. So, this album is a concept album, but it's also a very PERSONAL album.\n\nThe first official video off King of Kings is for the track, &quot;The Waking Eye&quot;, which was filmed in Norway (for the background scenes) and in Germany (for the action scenes). The Viking reenactment group, VÃƒÂ¦rjaborg, supplied 40-plus members for the battle and action sequences. Leaves' Eyes considers &quot;The Waking Eye&quot; to be their most ambitious video to date.\n\nTrack listing\n\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Sweven&quot;   \t02:03\n2. \t&quot;King of Kings&quot;   \t04:47\n3. \t&quot;Halvdan the Black&quot;   \t04:22\n4. \t&quot;The Waking Eye&quot;   \t04:41\n5. \t&quot;Feast of the Year&quot;   \t00:37\n6. \t&quot;Vengeance Venom&quot;   \t03:17\n7. \t&quot;Sacred Vow&quot;   \t04:20\n8. \t&quot;Edge of Steel&quot; (featuring Simone Simons from Epica) \t05:06\n9. \t&quot;HaraldskvÃƒÂ¦ÃƒÂ°i&quot;   \t03:24\n10. \t&quot;Blazing Waters&quot; (featuring Lindy-Fay Hella from Wardruna) \t07:30\n11. \t&quot;Swords in Rock&quot;   \t03:01\n12. \t&quot;Spellbound&quot; (Bonus Track) \t04:06\n13. \t&quot;Trail of Blood&quot; (Bonus Track) \t03:54\nTotal length:\n\t51:08 \t\n\n\n\nBand members\nLiv Kristine &amp; Alexander Krull\n\nCurrent members\n\n    Liv Kristine EspenÃƒÂ¦s Krull Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals (2003Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n    Alexander Krull Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards, vocals (2003Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n    Thorsten Bauer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, bass (2003Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n    Pete Streit Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar (2015Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n    Joris Nijenhuis Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (2013Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\nLive members\n\n    Niels LÃƒÂ¶ffler Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar (2011Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n    Oliver Holzwarth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar (2009)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5f82a911291130bb9081d25e08cb65b0355c40c","amp;dn":"Leaves%27+Eyes+-+King+Of+Kings+%28Deluxe+Edition%29+%282015%29320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5f82a911291130bb9081d25e08cb65b0355c40c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,248,42,145,18,145,19,11,185,8,29,37,224,140,182,91,3,85,196,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
