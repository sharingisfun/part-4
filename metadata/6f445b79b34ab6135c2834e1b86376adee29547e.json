All four play together on the opening &quot;So What&quot; and the closer, Gillespie's &quot;That's Earl Brother&quot;; they split off in different groupings on the other tracks. With Mulgrew Miller on piano, Peter Washington on bass, and Carl Allen on drums, the rhythm section is well in the pocket, and while none of the tunes are copies of their more famous namesakes (no chorus quoting here), the spirit is dead on the money on every track, making for some exciting jazz very well played. Highlights include &quot;Jordu,&quot; &quot;Nostalgia,&quot; &quot;My Funny Valentine,&quot; &quot;The Sidewinder,&quot; and &quot;There's No You.&quot; An inspired and accessible session. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - So What\n02 - Jordu\n03 - My Funny Valentine\n04 - Lotus Blossom\n05 - The Sidewinder\n06 - There's No You\n07 - Fire Waltz\n08 - Nostalgia\n09 - That's Earl Brother\n\nEnjoy and share!
