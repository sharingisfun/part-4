He's always been the man, from his introduction as Sergeant Fury in 1963 to being a superspy Agent of Shield and then the cigar-chomping, ass-chewing Director of Shield and now to the modern day Ultimate and MCU film version played by none other than the bad motha f*cka himself, Samuel L. Jackson. Fury is the guy with all the answers, to questions you didn't even know existed, and he has backup plans for his backup plans. Whether its backdoors into the SHIELD mainframe on the run, Life Model Decoys that can kill you or aid you, remote satellite access from anywhere on (or off!) planet and just generally awesome weapons and tech, Nick Fury is probably the single most powerful man in the Marvel Universe and really the only one that commands the respect of nearly every hero out there. \n\nThis collection contains every major and minor Nick Fury series - the classic version - except for Sergeant Fury and His Howling Commandos, which was just released in digital editions and collected by Nemesis43 in this torrent:\nthepiratebay.se/torrent/9897287\n\nI have uploaded the digital copy of Secret War, which is all about Fury, and you can find it here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9970868&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9970868&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEverything else, however, is included, even the Fury-heavy runs in Strange Tales and Marvel Special Edition. I have also added the two SHIELD miniseries which are tricky to find as well. The full contents are as follows:\n\n-Fury: Peacemaker 01-06 (2006, Reiu-DCP)\n-Fury &amp; Agent 13 01-02 (1998)\n-Fury MAX 01-13 (2012-2013, Digital, Zone-Empire)\n-Fury of SHIELD 01-03 (1995)\n-Fury v3 01-06 [MAX] (2001-2002, theMarxBros-DCP)\n-Nick Fury And His Agents of SHIELD 01-06 (1972-1973)\n-Nick Fury vs SHIELD 01-06 (1988)\n-Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD v1 01-18 (1968-1970)\n-Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD v2 01-47 (1989-1991)\n-Nick Fury's Howling Commandos 01-06 (2005-2006, DCP+)\n-S.H.I.E.L.D. v1 01-06 (2010-2011, Digital, Zone-Empire)\n-S.H.I.E.L.D. v2 01-04 (2011-2012, Digital, Zone-Empire)\n-Special Marvel Edition 05-14 (1972-1973)\n-Strange Tales 135-168 (1965-1968, Digital, AnPymGold+TLK-Empire)\n\n-Assorted Singles, GNs &amp; One-Shots, which has:\n   -Captain America &amp; Nick Fury - Blood Truce (1995)\n   -Captain America &amp; Nick Fury - Otherworld War (2001)\n   -Fury &amp; Black Widow - Death Duty (1995)\n   -Fury 001 (1994)\n   -Marvel Knights - Double Shot 02 [featuring a Fury tale by Grant Morrison!]\n   -Marvel Spotlight 31 (1976 c2cized) [written by the great Jim Starlin!]\n   -Marvel Tales v2 001 (Sgt Fury only) [reprints Fury's first appearance, by Stan Lee &amp; Jack Kirby!]\n   -Marvel Team-Up v1 083 (Nick Fury)\n   -Marvel Team-Up v1 085 (Shang Chi &amp; Black Widow &amp; Nick Fury)\n   -Secret War - From The Files Of Nick Fury (2005) (Rook-DCP)\n   -SHIELD Sketchbook (MDCE)(2010)(F)(webrip PeteThePIPster)\n   -What If v1 14 Sgt Fury fought WW2 in Outer Space\n   -Wolverine &amp; Nick Fury - Scorpio Rising\n   -Wolverine &amp; Nick Fury The Scorpio Connection GN (1989) (Bchry-DCP)\n\nThere was an old Fury collection out there that was in a dead, seven year old torrent; this has everything that was in that one (including upgraded versions wherever possible) along with much more. It is definitely the most comprehensive Fury/SHIELD compilation that exists. Major thanks to all the scanner groups who are credited, included various DCP scanners, TLK, Zone, and AnPymGold-Empire and PeteThePIPster. All credits are in the titles of the individual issues and the folders too, whenever applicable. Hope you enjoy this one and PLEASE SEED if you grab it and like it as it is quite large. Enjoy! :-)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:533169bc41434036d3dfbe2e155bcfb02d1900d8","amp;dn":"The+Nick+Fury+%2B+SHIELD+Collection+%281963-2013%7CD%2BS%7CEmpire%2BDCP%2B%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"533169bc41434036d3dfbe2e155bcfb02d1900d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,49,105,188,65,67,64,54,211,223,190,46,21,91,207,176,45,25,0,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
