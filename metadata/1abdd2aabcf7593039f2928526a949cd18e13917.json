Theories about ultimate reality, The contemplative traditions in all major world religions and in particularly in Buddhism and Adviata Vedanta. Cultural and Individual Evolution/Transformation. Theories about mindfulness and other forms of meditation, How quantum physics is, and is not, related to phenomena and mind.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you like this torrent you will quite likely like this as well:\n\nMEDITATION - in the Perspective of Science, Health or Spirituality\n(10 hours Video 66 Hours Audio on one single DVD)\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4570538/MEDITATION_-_in_the_Perspective_of_Science__Health_or_Spirituali\n\nSpirituality, philosophy and science on video and audio from WIE:\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3541916/Spirituality__philosophy_and_science_on_video_and_audio_from_WIE\n\nAlso remember that knowledge and wisdom is useless if a person is not emotionally healthy balanced as well.
