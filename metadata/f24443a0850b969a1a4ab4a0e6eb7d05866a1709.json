The Way of the Knife is the untold story of that shadow war: a campaign that has blurred the lines between soldiers and spies and lowered the bar for waging war across the globe. America has pursued its enemies with killer drones and special operations troops; trained privateers for assassination missions and used them to set up clandestine spying networks; and relied on mercurial dictators, untrustworthy foreign intelligence services, and proxy armies.\n\n\n2013\nepub","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f24443a0850b969a1a4ab4a0e6eb7d05866a1709","amp;dn":"The+Way+of+the+Knife%3A+The+CIA%2C+a+Secret+Army+%282013+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f24443a0850b969a1a4ab4a0e6eb7d05866a1709","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,68,67,160,133,11,150,154,26,74,180,160,230,235,125,5,134,106,23,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
