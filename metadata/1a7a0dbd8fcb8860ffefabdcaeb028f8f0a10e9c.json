Volume 1 covers the fundamentals, operations and catalysts, volume 2 examines devices, reactions and applications, with volume 3 rounding off the trilogy with system, process and plant engineering. Fluid dynamics, mixing, heat/mass transfer, purification and separation microstructured devices and microstructured reactors are explained in the first volume. Volume 2 segments microreactor design, fabrication and assembly, bulk and fine chemistry, polymerisation, fuel processing and functional materials into understandable parts. The final volume of the handbook addresses microreactor systems design and scale-up, sensing, analysis and control, chemical process engineering, economic and eco-efficiency analyses as well as microreactor plant case studies in one book. Together, this 3-volume handbook explains the science behind micro process engineering to the scale-up and their real life industrial applications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a7a0dbd8fcb8860ffefabdcaeb028f8f0a10e9c","amp;dn":"Micro+Process+Engineering+-+A+Comprehensive+Handbook+%283+Vol+Set%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a7a0dbd8fcb8860ffefabdcaeb028f8f0a10e9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,122,13,189,143,203,136,96,255,239,171,220,174,176,40,248,240,161,14,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
