There wasn't any consolidated Shadowrun novel collection for mobi, and as far as I can tell, this is the most complete collection on the web thus far.\n\nThis is a gift to the Shadowrun community, without whose support the two highly anticipated PC games, Shadowrun Returns and Shadowrun Online, wouldn't exist (not to mention the resurgence in popularity of the PnP supplements).\n\nMuch gratitude to all Kickstarter backers and, of course, all the great men and ladies that continue to work tirelessly to make Shadowrun a fantastic universe for us to &quot;live&quot; and play in.\n\n&lt;3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5382fa64af90249ae8df985bf8d0ad9c8bd24fac","amp;dn":"Shadowrun+novels+in+MOBI+%2834+of+48%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5382fa64af90249ae8df985bf8d0ad9c8bd24fac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,130,250,100,175,144,36,154,232,223,152,91,248,208,173,156,139,210,79,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
