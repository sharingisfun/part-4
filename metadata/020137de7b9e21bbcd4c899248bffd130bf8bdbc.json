However, it was the singer's third album, Good Girl Gone Bad, that made her a full-fledged international pop star with a regular presence atop the charts. Born Robyn Rihanna Fenty on February 20, 1988, in Saint Michael, Barbados, she exhibited a certain star quality as a young child, often winning beauty and talent contests. Because she lived on the fairly remote island of Barbados in the West Indies, however, she never foresaw the sort of stardom that would later befall her.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nGiven the proliferation of young and beautiful urban dance-pop divas dominating the radio and music video airwaves in 2005, it initially was tempting to discount Rihanna as yet another BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©-Ciara-Ashanti cash-in. But like her Def Jam labelmate Teairra Mari -- another young and beautiful urban dance-pop diva who emerged out of nowhere in 2005 -- Rihanna is winsome rather than wannabe, thanks in no small part to her producers. Just as Teairra Mari benefited greatly from irresistibly shrewd beat-making on her debut album, Rihanna benefits from the knowing production work of Syndicated Rhythm Productions, aka Evan Rogers.\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Pon De Replay\n02.Here I Go Again\n03.If It's Lovin' That You Want\n04.You Don't Love Me (No, No, No)\n05.That La, La, La\n06.The Last Time\n07.Willing To Wait\n08.Music Of The Sun\n09.Let Me\n10.Rush\n11.There's A Thug In My Life\n12.Now I Know\n13.Pon De Replay (Remix)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:020137de7b9e21bbcd4c899248bffd130bf8bdbc","amp;dn":"Rihanna+-+Music+Of+The+Sun+%282005%29+Mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"020137de7b9e21bbcd4c899248bffd130bf8bdbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,1,55,222,123,158,33,187,205,76,137,146,72,191,253,19,11,248,189,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
