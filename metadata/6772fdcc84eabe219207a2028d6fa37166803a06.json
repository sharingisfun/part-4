The band members are Duke Erikson, Shirley Manson, Steve Marker and Butch Vig.\n\nGarbage released a string of increasingly successful singles in 1995?1996, culminating in the hit &quot;Stupid Girl&quot;. Their debut album, Garbage, was an unexpected smash, selling over 5 million copies and reaching double platinum status in the UK, USA and Australia. Garbage spent two years working on their follow-up album Version 2.0 which topped the charts in the UK and hit #13 in the US. It was nominated for two Grammy Awards, Album of the Year and Best Rock Album. In 1999, they performed the theme song to the James Bond movie The World Is Not Enough. That year, they also contributed the song &quot;When I Grow Up&quot; to the Adam Sandler movie Big Daddy.\n\nThe band struggled to sustain their initial success, and the band&amp;#039;s 2001 third album beautifulgarbage failed to match the commercial success achieved by its predecessors. The band struggled to remain together and almost split in 2003, before returning with Bleed Like Me in 2005, peaking at a career-high #4 in the United States.\n\nThe band cut short their 2005 world tour, and announced an indefinite hiatus, but emphasized it was not a break-up. Garbage recently announced they were reuniting and are working on a greatest hits album set for release in July.\n\nThis 2007 greatest hits package compiles 15 hit tracks from Garbage, from their debut &amp;#039;95 single &quot;Vow,&quot; through &quot;Bleed Like Me,&quot; released a decade later. Additionally, two never-released new songs and a DVD with the band&amp;#039;s videos are included.\n\nCategory Rock/Pop, Rock, Alternative \nLabel Geffen Records (USA) \nOrig Year 2007 \nDiscs 1 \nStreet Date Jul 24, 2007 \nStudio/Live Studio \nMono/Stereo Stereo \n\nSong Title \n \n  1.
