All designers have their own way of working and their own combinations of the thousands of techniques one can apply when planning a new design project. \nBut there are some dos and don'ts that always figure in any heated debate about what one should or should not accept as the right way to create the best graphic design.\n\nThis book looks at key dos and don'ts, bringing them together in the form of a classically structured almanac. Packed with practical advice, but presented in a light-hearted fashion, the advisory rather than dictative approach means designers can take or leave the advice presented in each rule as is typical of most creatives with their own strong views on what does and does not constitute good design practice. \nIndividual entries will either bring forth knowing nods of agreement or hoots of derision, depending on whether or not the reader loves or hates hyphenation, has a pathological fear of beige, or thinks that baseline grids are boring.\n\n Thou Shall Not Use Comic Sans is the must-have collection of the best advice that any graphic designer should have at his fingertips, with each entry combining a specific rule with a commentary from a variety of experienced designers from all fields of the graphic design industry. Grouped into six, color-coded categoriesÃ¢â‚¬â€œtypography, color, layout, imagery, production, \nand the practice of designÃ¢â‚¬â€œbut presented numerically and in mixed groups, the reader can either dip in at random or use the book as the source of a daily lesson in how to produce great graphic design.\n\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;\n\nvisit me on Facebook - Google &quot;TEAM NANBAN TPB&quot;\n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/5a4b/a9546272.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/5a4b/a9546272.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTO JOIN TMRG ON FACEBOOK\nTMRG IS TORRENT MAFIA RELEASE GROUP","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1560d47149f4829812175a4bd72916a4ce82ad99","amp;dn":"Thou+Shall+Not+Use+Comic+Sans-+365+Graphic+Design+Sins+and+Virtu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1560d47149f4829812175a4bd72916a4ce82ad99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,96,212,113,73,244,130,152,18,23,90,75,215,41,22,164,206,130,173,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
