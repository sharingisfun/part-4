For more information on these comics, please see the wikilink here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_tie-in_comics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_tie-in_comics&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI have organized the files into 4 sections, like so:\n\n-Movie Adaptations, which contains:\n   -Captain America - The First Avenger (The Junior Novel and the first issue of three; only the first has been scanned so far)\n   -Iron Man I (I Am Iron Man 01-02)\n   -Iron Man II (Official Movie Adaptation 01-02)\n   -Thor (Official Movie Adaptation 01-02)\n\n-Movie Tie-Ins, which contains:\n   -Captain America - First Vengeance 01-04 (2011, Minutemen-DTermined)\n   -Iron Man 2 - Public Identity 01-03 (2010, Minutemen-DTermined)\n   -Iron Man 3 - Prelude 01-02 (2013, Digital, G85-Empire)\n   -The Avengers - Black Widow Strikes 01-03 (2012, Empire+)\n   -The Avengers Prelude - Fury's Big Week (01 - 08) (Digital) (2012) (complete)\n   -Thor - The Dark World - Prelude 01-02 (2013, Digital, Zone-Empire)\n   -One-Shots (featuring the following):\n     -Avengers -The Avengers Initiative (2012) (Digtal) (Zone-Empire)\n     -Captain America &amp; Thor - Avengers 001 (2011) (Digital) (Cypher-Empire)\n     -Captain America Homecoming 001 (2014) (Digital) (Zone-Empire)\n     -Iron Man 2 - Agents of SHIELD 001 (2010)(c2c)(PeteThePIPster)\n     -Iron Man 2 - Fist of Iron 001 (MDCE)(F)(2010)(PeteThePIPster)\n     -Iron Man-Hulk-Fury 01 (2009) (Minutemen-DZs)\n     -Marvel's Captain America - The Winter Soldier Infinite Comic 001 (2014) (Digital) (Pirate-Empire)\n\n-Individual MDCE Issues (Redundant), which has Marvel Digital Comics Exclusives that are in other files in the Tie-Ins section; however I have added the individual issues here as well for the sake of completeness. YOU DO NOT NEED TO DOWNLOAD THIS FOLDER unless you want duplicates, are a completionist or prefer the digital versions done by PeteThePIPster:\n   -Incredible Hulk - The Fury Files 01-02 (in Iron Man-Hulk-Fury)\n   -Iron Man - Fast Friends 01-02 (in Iron Man-Hulk-Fury)\n   -Iron Man 2 - Black Widow 01, Phil Coulson 01, Nick Fury 01 (combined as Iron Man 2 - Agents of SHIELD)\n\n-Bonus:\n   -Captain America - The First Avenger (2011) (SDCC Poster, 2010) (digital) (Minutemen-InnerDemons) [a large, nice poster in cbr format, from San Diego Comic Con]\n   -Iron Man 2 [Daily Mirror][2010][c2c][PeteThePIPster] [a supplement to the movie from the Daily Mirror newspaper, with Iron Man against Doc Ock]\n   -Iron Man 2 Movie Promo (2010) (pink hot scans) [a short story titled &quot;Security Breach&quot; which takes place before the second film]\n\nThere is a mix of digital and traditional scans in the content, all of which are listing in the filenames of the comics themselves, these include Minutemen-DTermined, InnerDemons and DZ; PeteThePipster; Enjolras; Lusipher, UberSoldier and Team-DCP; and G85, Danger, Pirate, Cypher, and Zone-Empire. Massive credit to ALL the scanner groups for their time, hard work, and effort, without which we would not have any of these to read. Thank you!\n\nSpecial thanks to the great Nemesis43 for tracking down and posting the digital copies of Fury's Big Week for me; I really appreciate that! I have left his folder names intact so if you grabbed that recently, you can easily download the rest and re-seed that section as well with no extra effort. PLEASE SEED this one, I worked hard on it and hope you enjoy as always. :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8d6eb1596129a0ae6d1a1f47979306ed5ccd968","amp;dn":"The+Marvel+Cinematic+Universe+Collection+%282008-2014%7CD%2BS%7CMM%2BE%2B%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8d6eb1596129a0ae6d1a1f47979306ed5ccd968","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,214,235,21,150,18,154,10,230,209,161,244,121,121,48,110,213,204,217,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
