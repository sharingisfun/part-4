They treat it as a craft. They are professionals.\n\n \n\nIn The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers, legendary software expert Robert C. Martin introduces the disciplines, techniques, tools, and practices of true software craftsmanship. This book is packed with practical adviceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“about everything from estimating and coding to refactoring and testing. It covers much more than technique: It is about attitude. Martin shows how to approach software development with honor, self-respect, and pride; work well and work clean; communicate and estimate faithfully; face difficult decisions with clarity and honesty; and understand that deep knowledge comes with a responsibility to act.\n\n \n\nReaders will learn\n\n    * What it means to behave as a true software craftsman\n    * How to deal with conflict, tight schedules, and unreasonable managers\n    * How to get into the flow of coding, and get past writerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s block\n    * How to handle unrelenting pressure and avoid burnout\n    * How to combine enduring attitudes with new development paradigms\n    * How to manage your time, and avoid blind alleys, marshes, bogs, and swamps\n    * How to foster environments where programmers and teams can thrive\n    * When to say ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“and how to say it\n    * When to say ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“and what yes really means\n\n \n\nGreat software is something to marvel at: powerful, elegant, functional, a pleasure to work with as both a developer and as a user. Great software isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t written by machines. It is written by professionals with an unshakable commitment to craftsmanship. The Clean Coder will help you become one of themÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“and earn the pride and fulfillment that they alone possess.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 256 pages\n    * Publisher: Prentice Hall; 1 edition (May 23, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0137081073\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0137081073","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f68b59c5de4f107199cfc08a8a048925ebe30fb4","amp;dn":"The+Clean+Coder+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f68b59c5de4f107199cfc08a8a048925ebe30fb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,139,89,197,222,79,16,113,153,207,192,138,138,4,137,37,235,227,15,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
