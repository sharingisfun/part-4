Incredible Flying Machines takes a lighthearted but carefully researched look at Man's attempts to imitate the birds,Ã¢â‚¬â€ from the legendary Icarus to the present day. This book pays homage to the brave and brilliant schemers who flout aeronautical conventions in pursuit of more imaginative forms of flight, and charts triumph and disaster with equal candor. It spotlights the amazing number of 'first ever' flights as well as the considerable number of 'never-flew-at-all' contraptions. There are flying machines with no wings and some with nine; flapping arm fliers and 'flying flapjacks', alongside more serious innovations such as balloons, airships and autogiros. From the smallest to the largest, from the oldest to the projects of tomorrow, the extremes of aerial ingenuity are affectionately portrayed and illustrated by over 100 fascinating photographs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a25bbb067aa9802584a223c32aa2f25141d6187","amp;dn":"Incredible+Flying+Machines-An+Anthology+of+Eccentric+Aircraft","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a25bbb067aa9802584a223c32aa2f25141d6187","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,37,187,176,103,170,152,2,88,74,34,60,50,170,47,37,20,29,97,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
