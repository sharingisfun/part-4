One day, Himura Kenshin, a wandering swordsman with a disarming charm and an unusual sword with a reversed blade, comes across Kamiya Kaoru, a young woman who succeeded her father's school of sword fighting. However, while growing modernity gives the new age a veneer of order, troubles both new and old plague Japan: Kaoru's school has recently lost its followers after a string of murders by an individual claiming to use techniques from the school, while the industrialist Takeda KanryÃ…Â« plots to amass arms through profits brought in by a highly-addictive preparation of opium. Kenshin's dark past also continues to follow him, and he is forced to confront it when a chain of events beginning with an assault on Kaoru's dojo suddenly takes place one day.\n\n\n\nAudio language : Japanese\n\n\nSubTitle language : ENGLISH\n\n\n*English subs by Yuizaki_Libra*\n\n\n\n\nCAST :\n\n\nHimura Kenshin - Takeru SatÃ…ï¿½\n\nKamiya Kaoru - Emi Takei\n\nSagara Sanosuke - Munetaka Aoki\n\nMyÃ…ï¿½jin Yahiko - Taketo Tanaka\n\nTakani Megumi - Yuu Aoi\n\nSaitÃ…ï¿½ Hajime - Yosuke Eguchi\n\nUdÃ…ï¿½ Jin-e - Kouji Kikkawa\n\nTakeda KanryÃ…Â« - Teruyuki Kagawa\n\nGein - Ayano Go\n\nInui Banjin - Genki Sudou","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05eaeb23bb0fef6e26912088c426b431cbccb31e","amp;dn":"RUROUNI.KENSHIN.GB.BDRip.720P.x264.Hi10P.AAC.5.1CH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05eaeb23bb0fef6e26912088c426b431cbccb31e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,234,235,35,187,15,239,110,38,145,32,136,196,38,180,49,203,204,179,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
