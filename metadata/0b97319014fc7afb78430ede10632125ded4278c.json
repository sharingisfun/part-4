Wii (New Ã£â€šÂ¹Ã£Æ’Â¼Ã£Æ’â€˜Ã£Æ’Â¼Ã£Æ’Å¾Ã£Æ’ÂªÃ£â€šÂªÃ£Æ’â€“Ã£Æ’Â©Ã£â€šÂ¶Ã£Æ’Â¼Ã£â€šÂº Wii NyÃ…Â« SÃ…Â«pÃ„ï¿½ Mario BurazÃ„ï¿½zu WÃ„Â«?) is a 2009 side-scrolling platform video game published and developed by Nintendo for the Wii video game console. The game was released on November 11, 2009, in Australia, November 15, 2009, in North America, November 20, 2009, in Europe and December 3, 2009, in Japan. It is the first game in the Mario main series since Mario Bros. to feature simultaneous multiplayer gameplay, and the first title to include Nintendo's new 'Super Guide' feature. To highlight the uniqueness of the title, Nintendo chose to use a red keep case instead of the traditional white. The game is also the first Mario sidescroller to have up to four player multiplayer.\n\nThe gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plot is similar to those of other side-scrolling Mario games. New Super Mario Bros. Wii follows Mario as he fights his way through Bowser's henchmen to rescue Princess Peach. Mario has access to several power-ups that help him complete his quest, including the Ice Flower, the Fire Flower, and the Starman, each giving him unique abilities. While traveling through up to nine worlds with a total of 80 levels, Mario must defeat Bowser's children (the Koopalings and Bowser Jr.), Kamek, and Bowser himself before finally saving Princess Peach.\n\nNew Super Mario Bros. Wii has been critically and commercially successful with gaming aggregators GameRankings and Metacritic reporting average scores of 88% and 87/100, respectively. As of March 2014, it is the fourth best-selling game on the Wii, at 28.65 million copies sold worldwide. It received several honors, including the 2009 Best Wii Game award from the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards, IGN, and GameTrailers.\n\nA follow-up to New Super Mario Bros. Wii, entitled New Super Mario Bros. 2, was released for the Nintendo 3DS in August 2012. A direct sequel, New Super Mario Bros. U, was developed for the Wii U console and launched with the system in November 2012.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b97319014fc7afb78430ede10632125ded4278c","amp;dn":"New+Super+Mario+Bros+Wii+%5BMULTI3%5D+%5BNTSC%5D+%5BFULGAME%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b97319014fc7afb78430ede10632125ded4278c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,151,49,144,20,252,122,251,120,67,14,222,16,99,33,37,222,212,39,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
