Undaunted by her waspish reputation Petruchio attempts to woo the not-so-fair maiden, but is faced with a tirade of poisonous insults&quot;-\n\nMy notes\n\n   Surprises appear in this version of The Taming of the Shrew.  That's my teaser and I will give none away.  Having seen many of the Taming of the Shrew play to video productions each has special attractions.  This is why I began doing Shakespeare torrents with the Bard Productions version of Taming of the Shrew done by a company in San Fransisco which also uses the Globe replica stage design.    Again, without giving anything away,  I invite the viewer to look at both.  More information on my torrents  which are maintained in my collection follows in comments.  \n\n  For those who have followed these torrent shares from the Globe you will see some familair faces, most particularly from Doctor Faustus by Marlowe and also All's Well That Ends Well in this Globe collection.\n\n  There are many features of the complete dvd package not included here.  As always I encourage users to add my torrents to their permanent seeds but also request your libraries add these Globe productions to their collections everywhere.\n\nnotes written March 1, 2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ebbfd77dd95ea6df358da0da9d82d365e1b495a","amp;dn":"Shakespeares+Globe+On+Screen+The+Taming+of+the+Shrew+%282012%29+Opus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ebbfd77dd95ea6df358da0da9d82d365e1b495a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,187,253,119,221,149,234,109,243,88,218,13,169,216,45,54,94,27,73,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
