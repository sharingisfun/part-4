G. Jung: Dreams (From Volumes 4, 8, 12, and 16 of the Collected Works). Translated by R. F. C. Hull, with a new foreword by Sonu Shamdasani. Princeton University Press, 2010.\n\nISBN 9780691150482 | 368 pages | ePub\n\nDream analysis is a distinctive and foundational part of analytical psychology, the school of psychology founded by C. G. Jung and his successors. \n\nThis volume collects Jung's most insightful contributions to the study of dreams and their meaning. The essays in this volume, written by Jung between 1909 and 1945, reveal Jung's most essential views about dreaming -- especially regarding the relationship between language and dream. Through these studies, Jung grew to understand that dreams are themselves a language, a language through which the soul communicates with the body. \n\nThe essays included are &quot;The Analysis of Dreams,&quot; &quot;On the Significance of Number Dreams,&quot; &quot;General Aspects of Dream Psychology,&quot; &quot;On the Nature of Dreams,&quot; &quot;The Practical Use of Dream Analysis,&quot; and &quot;Individual Dream Symbolism in Relation to Alchemy&quot; (complete with illustrations).\n\nNew to this edition is a foreword by Sonu Shamdasani, Philemon Professor of Jung History at University College London and editor of The Red Book.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbfbed61464d8634b77d8fe7dfd453143ae29fb5","amp;dn":"C.+G.+Jung+on+Dream+Interpretation+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbfbed61464d8634b77d8fe7dfd453143ae29fb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,251,237,97,70,77,134,52,183,125,143,231,223,212,83,20,58,226,159,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
