Being off the grid can refer to many different aspects of energy and resource independence, from rainwater collection, to photovoltaic (PV) systems, to gray-water systems and more. Diagrams and clear explanations of technologies and their appropriate applications are provided alongside the case studies that explain just how the technologies work and how they may best be applied to each individual situation.\n\n\nBy Lori Ryker\nPublished by Gibbs Smith in 2007\nTags: nonfiction, architecture\nEPUB, Retail, 128 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:284964104a9c40ec4fd8ea73358648c5d3a36cf7","amp;dn":"Off+The+Grid+Homes++%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"284964104a9c40ec4fd8ea73358648c5d3a36cf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,73,100,16,74,156,64,236,79,216,234,115,53,134,72,197,211,163,108,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
