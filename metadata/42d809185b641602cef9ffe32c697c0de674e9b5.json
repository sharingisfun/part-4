Reminiscent of some of the slower jams from his popular mixtape So Far Gone and his debut LP, Drake continues in the vein of a tortured lover on the emotionally charged track. The song finds Drake playing the role of line stepper as he pines for a taken woman all while trying to gain her affections. Upon the songÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s release this morning, the track has spread throughout the Web with fans commenting in droves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42d809185b641602cef9ffe32c697c0de674e9b5","amp;dn":"Drake+-+Marvins+Room","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42d809185b641602cef9ffe32c697c0de674e9b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,216,9,24,91,100,22,2,206,249,255,227,44,105,124,13,230,116,233,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
