Also Haali splitter for the ordered chapters.\n\n\n\n\nSo this is a v2. What is different?\nThere were a few corrupt pieces in ep 3 and 4, which got corrupted due to bad disk or smth. File names are the same, so just recheck the files you have in this torrent, and you'll just need a few mb to complete the torrent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55dd87d5e36e13a10e75375c8abb84fa4ae92c02","amp;dn":"Highschool_of_the_Dead_%5B1080p%2CBluRay%2Cx264%5D_-_gg-THORA+v2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55dd87d5e36e13a10e75375c8abb84fa4ae92c02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,221,135,213,227,110,19,161,14,117,55,92,138,187,132,250,74,233,44,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
