Chances are it was because you didn't care about the characters. Screenwriter's Compass presents a new way of approaching screenwriting, examining how effective screen storytelling must be grounded in the vivid imagining and presentation of character.\n\nScreenwriter's Compass will not offer formulas to follow but instead will give you the tools needed to chart your own path to screenwriting success. It details useful ways of thinking about writing, as well as practical ideas and concepts to help you discover the unique geography of your own imagination and navigate the problems posed by the struggle to express vision, agenda, and story. You'll learn how to root your writing in motivation and voice, to create screenplays that seduce and make your reader lean forward, and, most importantly, identify with your characters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a095749e654306db7a40e35bd101eca63909c84c","amp;dn":"Screenwriter%27s+Compass%3A+Character+As+True+North+by+Guy+Gallo.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a095749e654306db7a40e35bd101eca63909c84c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,149,116,158,101,67,6,219,122,64,227,91,209,1,236,166,57,9,200,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
