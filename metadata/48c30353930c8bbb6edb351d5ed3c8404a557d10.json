It was released October 9, 2007, on Jablonsky's 37th birthday. According to the back of the CD cover, 11 of the 20 tracks are arranged differently from what is heard in the actual film, resulting in extended- but accurately-complete- soundtracks.\n\nBiography\nfonte:  Visit this link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jablonsky\nSteve Jablonsky (born October 9, 1970) is an American music composer for film, television and video games. He has composed the soundtracks to the movies The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), Steamboy (2004), The Island (2005), Transformers (2007), D-War (2007) and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009). He was also a contributor on Team America: World Police (2004) among many others. In addition, he helped compose some of the music to the video game Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, and composed the theme music in 2003 for the BBC's Seven Wonders of the Industrial World. He continues to write music for the television show Desperate Housewives (2004-current) since the fourth episode . His track &quot;Trailblazing&quot; served as the opening theme for WrestleMania X8 and WrestleMania XIX.\nSteve also wrote the music for Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars, taking the place of the former Command &amp; Conquer music composer Frank Klepacki, who was unable to write the game's score due to his involvement with Universe at War: Earth Assault.\nJablonsky's most recent projects include the scores for the Michael Bay live action feature film Transformers, the South Korean film D-War and Gears of War 2 for the Xbox 360 gaming console. He works in Hans Zimmer's studio Remote Control Productions.\n\nFormat\nMP3 - 320 Kbps - 44 kHz\n\nVisit http://www.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48c30353930c8bbb6edb351d5ed3c8404a557d10","amp;dn":"Transformers+-+Original+Soundtrack+%282007%29%2C+%5BLOSSY+MP3+320+kbps%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48c30353930c8bbb6edb351d5ed3c8404a557d10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,195,3,83,147,12,139,187,110,219,53,29,94,211,200,64,74,85,125,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
