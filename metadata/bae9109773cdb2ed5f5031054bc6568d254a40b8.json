The scene: two bodies in a carbon monoxide filled car. A former nurse Lesley Howell, and a police officer Trevor Buchanan, have apparently taken their own lives together.â€¦\r\n \r\nThis is the true story of a Sunday school teacher and a respectable dentist who formed a murderous partnership.\r\n \r\nHazel Buchanan and Colin Howell meet at their local Baptist Church in Coleraine, Northern Ireland and embark upon a passionate and destructive affair, which climaxes in an elaborate plot to commit the â€œperfect murderâ€ to kill both their partners, Lesley and Trevor, and make it look like a suicide pact.\r\n \r\nThe killers fool the police and get away with murder, but their relationship soon sours and they separate. They rebuild their lives, each remarrying and prospering, but can never escape what they have done. As a series of disasters befalls Howell, he finally confesses his crimes to the horrified elders of his church.\r\n \r\nConvicted of murder, Howell implicates Hazel in the killing. Hazel admits involvement but pleads not guilty, claiming she was coerced. In a climactic murder trial, Howell gives evidence against his former lover.\r\n \r\n \r\nColin Howell  JAMES NESBITT\r\nHazel Buchanan  GENEVIEVE Oâ€™REILLY\r\nLesley Howell  LAURA PYPER\r\nTrevor Buchanan  GLEN WALLACE\r\nPastor John Hansford  JASON WATKINS\r\nGrandpa Harry Clarke  JAMES GREENE\r\nAndy Comerford  DAVID PEARSE\r\nHilary McAuley  ALI WHITE\r\nDental Receptionist  EILEEN McCLOSKEY\r\nMatthew Howell  RILEY HAMILTON\r\nLauren Howell  NINA WOODS\r\nDaniel Howell  MURRAY SPEERS\r\nAndrew Buchanan  JACK ERDIS\r\nLisa Buchanan  SOPHIE MELLOTTE\r\n\r\n[b]Episode 3[/b]\r\n \r\nAs the inquest approaches, Colin and Hazel have to hold their nerve.
