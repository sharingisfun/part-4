Or if a passerby calls you a &quot;sausage&quot; (une andouille), should you respond by saying thank you? The answer to both questions is an indisputable, &quot;No!&quot; But how would a nonnative speaker know this? Thanks to David Burke's newest book, there's no need &quot;to hit your biscuit&quot; (se frapper le biscuit; &quot;to worry&quot;) any longer!

His love of language inspired him to delve into the intricacies of words and led him to become a prominent author of more than 100 books on understanding slang and idioms in different languages, as well as books that teach kids foreign languages through fairy tales. His materials on slang and idioms are currently used as course curriculum by Berlitz International, UCLA, Harvard University, NYU and Hewlett Packard, and even by the writers of The Simpsons to give Bart his coolness.\r\nIN 1986, DAVID FOUNDED SLANGMAN PUBLISHING which specializes in materials that teach children foreign languages, as well as products teaching teens and adults slang and idioms in a variety of languages.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nIntroduction . . .  vii\r\nLegend . . .  ix\r\nPart 1 STREET FRENCH DICTIONARY 1\r\n(popular French Terms Including Slang, Idioms, Colloquialisms, Vulgarities, Proverbs, Special Notes, Synonyms, Antonyms, &amp; Variations)\r\nPart 2 POPULAR FRENCH GESTURES 18\r\nPart 3 ENGUSH WORDS USED IN FRENCH 197\r\nPart 4 STREET FRENCH THESAURUS 205\r\n(General Slang Synonyms &amp; Expressions)\r\nPart 5 STREET FHENCH THESAURUS 299\r\n(Obscenities, Vulgarities, Insults, Bodily Functions &amp; Sounds, Sexual Slang, Offensive Language, etc.)\r\n \nhttps://s32.postimg.org/dm6i0itjp/Street_French_Slang_Dictionary_Thesaurus.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ac2db24382cf25d67b946855773cf366d31673e","amp;dn":"Street+French+Slang+Dictionary+%26amp%3B+Thesaurus+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ac2db24382cf25d67b946855773cf366d31673e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,194,219,36,56,44,242,93,103,185,70,133,87,115,207,54,109,49,103,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
