But the journey has a terrible cost. It alters not only the future but he &quot;present&quot; in which we live.\n\nA century after the publication of H. G. Wells' immortal The Time Machine, Stephen Baxter, today's most acclaimed new &quot;hard SF&quot; author, and the acknowledged Clarke, returns to the distant conflict between the Eloi and the Morlocks in a story that is at once an exciting expansion, and a radical departure based on the astonishing new understandings of quantum physics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d32976e2ae740c33ea9de3bc2b9cf3192c191c1","amp;dn":"Stephen+Baxter+-+The+Time+Ships+%28retail%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d32976e2ae740c33ea9de3bc2b9cf3192c191c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,50,151,110,42,231,64,195,62,169,222,59,194,185,207,49,146,193,145,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
