It was released on October 8, 1996 in the US through Nothing and Interscope Records. The record's success in mainstream charts turned the band and its frontman into a household name. This led to numerous protests from religious and civic groups such as the American Family Association due to the band's perceived anti-Christian stance as well as the transgressive and confrontational nature of their music, performance and appearance.\nIt is a rock opera concept album and the first installment in a trilogy that includes Mechanical Animals and Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death). After the release of Holy Wood, Manson revealed that the overarching story within the trilogy is divulged in reverse chronological order. Holy Wood, therefore, begins the story, followed by Mechanical Animals, and concluding with Antichrist Superstar. It was recorded at Nothing Studios in New Orleans and produced by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails.\nThe album has sold over 7 million copies worldwide, with 1.9 million of those sold in the United States alone.[3] It spawned two commercial singles (&quot;The Beautiful People&quot; and &quot;Tourniquet&quot;), and an autobiography (The Long Hard Road Out of Hell). The band supported the album with the controversial Dead to the World Tour. The album debuted at Ã¢â€žâ€“ 3 on the Billboard 200.\n\n\nimage Review:\nI remember buying Ã¢â‚¬ËœAntichrist SuperstarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ like it was yesterday: I was in Tokyo with my dad and I needed something to fill the silence during the long drives to the various tourist spots. Being that I was middle school at the time and I was a rebellious little scoundrel, the thought of getting away with buying a Marilyn Manson album was just too cool to not follow through on. My dad only realized what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d bought when it was too late: I was hooked. This was an album that was metal, industrial, dirty, grimy, violent, sexual, full of horror and perfect for my testosterone-ridden, hyper-sexualized teenage angst.\nTo quote Corinthians (which is strange enough seeing as IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Jewish AND an atheist), Ã¢â‚¬Å“When I was a child I spoke as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child; but when I became a man I put away childish things.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ There came a time when I had to rein in my hormones and grow out of my rebelliousness, if for no other reason than it just became boring and stale. So, the question then arises, how does Ã¢â‚¬ËœAntichrist SuperstarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ hold up considering this situation?\nLetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s get the production out of the way before I chat about the album and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impact, shall we? Ã¢â‚¬ËœAntichrist SuperstarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ has that unmistakable raw mid-90Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s sound. However, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only listening to it now that I fully appreciate just how much is actually going on in each track. There is an ungodly amount that will take who knows how many listens to fully appreciate. The album goes from furious raging industrial metal to mellow, haunting ambient soundscapes with great ease, all while sounding fantastic.\nOkay, so it sounds great. Does it still rock? Fuck yeah it rocks! I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t explain it, but listening to this album pumped me up as though I was that anger-fueled teenager again. I found myself reveling in the chaos, head banging until I was dizzy. There is something about this album that is undeniably infectious and powerful. This was definitely Manson at the top of his game.\nSongs like Ã¢â‚¬ËœLittle HornÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Beautiful PeopleÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ are prime examples of the angry side of the album while Ã¢â‚¬ËœCryptorchidÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ, Ã¢â‚¬ËœTourniquetÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ, and Ã¢â‚¬ËœMinute Of DecayÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ show the more haunting aspects.\nThe Final Word: ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been 15 years since Ã¢â‚¬ËœAntichrist SuperstarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ hit shelves and the album is still as intense as when I first heard it. Manson, if you read this, please find that energy and ferocity again. Meanwhile, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be blasting this until the day I die.\n\n\nAlbum List:\n\nSIDE A\n1. Irresponsible Hate Anthem\n2.
