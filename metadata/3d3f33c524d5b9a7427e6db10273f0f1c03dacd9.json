The RTFM contains the basic syntax for commonly used Linux and Windows command line tools, but it also encapsulates unique use cases for powerful tools such as Python and Windows PowerShell. The RTFM will repeatedly save you time looking up the hard to remember Windows nuances such as Windows wmic and dsquery command line tools, key registry values, scheduled tasks syntax, startup locations and Windows scripting. More importantly, it should teach you some new red team techniques.\n\n\nThis has been modified by 0E800 without permission from the author - it includes extra content.\n\n\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d3f33c524d5b9a7427e6db10273f0f1c03dacd9","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+RTFM+-+Red+Team+Field+Manual+v3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d3f33c524d5b9a7427e6db10273f0f1c03dacd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,63,51,197,36,213,185,167,66,126,109,177,2,115,240,241,192,61,172,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
