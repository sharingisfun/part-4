Shogren (Elsevier, 2013).pdf\r\n\r\nEvery decision about energy involves its price and cost.  The price of gasoline and the cost of buying from foreign producers; the price of nuclear and hydroelectricity and the costs to our ecosystems; the price of electricity from coal-fired plants and the cost to the atmosphere.  Giving life to inventions, lifestyle changes, geopolitical shifts, and things in-between, energy economics is of high interest to Academia, Corporations and Governments. \r\n\r\nFor economists, energy economics is one of three subdisciplines which, taken together, compose an economic approach to the exploitation and preservation of natural resources:\r\n\r\nenergy economics, which focuses on energy-related subjects such as renewable energy, hydropower, nuclear power, and the political economy of energy\r\nresource economics, which covers subjects in land and water use, such as mining, fisheries, agriculture, and forests\r\nenvironmental economics, which takes a broader view of natural resources through economic concepts such as risk, valuation, regulation, and distribution\r\nAlthough the three are closely related, they are not often presented as an integrated whole. This Encyclopedia has done just that by unifying these fields into a high-quality and unique overview.\r\n\r\nThe only reference work that codifies the relationships among the three subdisciplines: energy economics, resource economics and environmental economics. Understanding these relationships just became simpler!\r\nNobel Prize Winning Editor-in-Chief (joint recipient 2007 Peace Prize), Jason Shogren, has demonstrated excellent team work again, by coordinating and steering his Editorial Board to produce a cohesive work that guides the user seamlessly through the diverse topics\r\nThis work contains in equal parts information from and about business, academic, and government perspectives and is intended to serve as a tool for unifying and systematizing research and analysis in business, universities, and government","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70d676c6bcb28cff97bb605be6072d28f554e42e","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Energy%2C+Natural+Resource%2C+and+Environmental+Econ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70d676c6bcb28cff97bb605be6072d28f554e42e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,214,118,198,188,178,140,255,151,187,96,91,230,7,45,40,245,84,228,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
