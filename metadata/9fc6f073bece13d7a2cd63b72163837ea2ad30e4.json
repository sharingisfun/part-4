Unhalfbricking was, if only in retrospect, a transitional album for the young Fairport Convention, in which the group shed its closest ties to its American folk-rock influences and started to edge toward a more traditional British folk-slanted sound. That shift wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be definitive until their next album, Liege &amp; Lief. But the strongest link to the American folk-rock harmony approach left with the departure of Ian Matthews, who left shortly after the sessions for Unhalfbricking began.\nThe mixture of obscure American folk-rock songs, original material, and traditional interpretations that had fallen into place with What We Did on Our Holidays earlier in the year was actuallyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nstill intact, if not as balanced. Sandy DennyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two compositions, her famous Ã¢â‚¬Å“Who Knows Where the Time Goes?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the far less celebrated but magnetically brooding Ã¢â‚¬Å“Autopsy,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ were among the recordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s highlights.\nSo too were the goofball French Cajun cover of Bob DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“If You Gotta Go, Go NowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (here retitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Si Tu Dois Partir,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and a British hit) and the magnificent reading of DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“PercyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Song,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ though the bash through DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Million Dollar BashÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was less effective. Richard ThompsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pair of songs, however, were less memorable. The clear signpost to the future was their 11-minute take on the traditional song Ã¢â‚¬Å“A SailorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Life,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with guest fiddle by Dave Swarbrick, soon to join Fairport himself and make his own strong contribution toward reshaping the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fc6f073bece13d7a2cd63b72163837ea2ad30e4","amp;dn":"Fairport+Convention+-+Unhalfbricking+%282014%29+SHM-CD+SACD+FLAC+Beo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fc6f073bece13d7a2cd63b72163837ea2ad30e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,198,240,115,190,206,19,215,162,205,99,183,33,99,131,126,162,173,48,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
