It's a confident final trot 'round the track by one of the greats of postwar American literature. After 40 years of practice, Vonnegut's got his schtick down cold, and it's a pleasure--if a slightly tame one--to watch him go through his paces one more time.\n\nTimequake's a mongrel; it is half novel, half memoir, the project of a decade's worth of writer's block, a book &quot;that didn't want to be written.&quot; The premise is standard-issue Vonnegut: &quot;...a timequake, a sudden glitch in the space-time continuum, made everybody and everything do exactly what they'd done during past decades, for good or ill, a second time...&quot; Simultaneously, the author's favorite tricks are on display--frequent visits with the shopworn science fiction writer Kilgore Trout, a Hitchcockian appearance by the author at the book's end, and frequent authorial opining on love, war, and society.\n\nThanks to martin88 for originally uploading this torrent to theaudiobookbay.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7567f609baed7a20cc2f2e9908e61bd952985f63","amp;dn":"Kurt+Vonnegut+-+Timequake+-+%28audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7567f609baed7a20cc2f2e9908e61bd952985f63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,103,246,9,186,237,122,32,204,47,46,153,8,230,27,217,82,152,95,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
