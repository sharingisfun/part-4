From newborns and toddlers through grade school students and high school seniors, this resource addresses many issues faced by portrait photographers, including replacing stale poses with fresh ideas, retaining the attention of infants, allowing a subject's individuality to show, capturing group portraits, and posing kids of different ages together. Organized in chronological order, this book's accessibility is further enhanced by images that are arranged from head shots to full-length portraits for each age group. Providing inspiration for remaining creative on a daily basis, this work is the perfect resource for portrait photographers.\n\n\nBy Michelle Perkins\nPublished by Amherst Media Inc. in 2012\nEPUB, Retail, 125 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:307ef2c0bbde249c3d26073ec6d924581057ed9d","amp;dn":"500+Poses+for+Photographing+Children%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"307ef2c0bbde249c3d26073ec6d924581057ed9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,126,242,192,187,222,36,156,61,38,7,62,198,217,36,88,16,87,237,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
