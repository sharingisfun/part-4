ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no wonder that many parents approach their childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s adolescence with fear and trepidation. According to renowned neuropsychiatrist Daniel Siegel, however, if parents and teens can work together to form a deeper understanding of the brain science behind all the tumult, they will be able to turn conflict into connection and form a deeper understanding of one another.  \n \nIn Brainstorm, Siegel illuminates how brain development impacts teenagersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ behavior and relationships. Drawing on important new research in the field of interpersonal neurobiology, he explores exciting ways in which understanding how the teenage brain functions can help parents make what is in fact an incredibly positive period of growth, change, and experimentation in their childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lives less lonely and distressing on both sides of the generational divide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4533ba6c5b8d60508d7ac87db1e707b08cb954fd","amp;dn":"Brainstorm+-+Daniel+J.+Siegel.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4533ba6c5b8d60508d7ac87db1e707b08cb954fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,51,186,108,91,141,96,80,141,122,200,125,177,231,7,176,140,185,84,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
