It's without any doubt the album that made Simon Posford known, and that forever changed goa music. Clean sounds and a new way to use them, make this album a new reference in the goa movement. The Psychedelic-Trance was really born... LSD, the first title of the album, takes us directly to the psychedelic musical world of Simon Posford. Simon's style is well receive and places him in the ranks of musical genius. Twisted is well composed and no aspect of the tracks were neglected. The songs are mix together perflectly and we are captivated by this trip to the beginning to the end of the cd. With this album, Simon open a new way in the Goa movement. Every Goa fans should own this album. It would be sinful not to have it :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44c56c2ddb188fe43350e549cf218217fcd9ef77","amp;dn":"Hallucinogen+-+Twisted","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44c56c2ddb188fe43350e549cf218217fcd9ef77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,197,108,45,219,24,143,228,51,80,229,73,207,33,130,23,252,217,239,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
