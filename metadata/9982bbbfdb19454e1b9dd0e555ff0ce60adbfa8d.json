It was released on October 22, 2010 by Hollywood Records, exclusively to European countries, as the second single from Cyrus' third studio album, Can't Be Tamed. The writing group composed the track about the feelings a club's environment can lead one to believe. &quot;Who Owns My Heart&quot; is musically club-oriented and driven by synths. Lyrically, the song questions speaks of meeting a potential love interest at a club.\n\n&quot;Who Owns My Heart&quot; has garnered mixed reception from contemporary critics. Some critics argued it was dull and faceless, while other deemed it one of the best tracks on Can't Be Tamed. The song charted on the top forty of the Belgian Tip Singles Chart. A corresponding music video for &quot;Who Owns My Heart&quot; was directed by Robert Hales. It follows Cyrus throughout preparing herself for, arriving, and dancing at a mansion party.
