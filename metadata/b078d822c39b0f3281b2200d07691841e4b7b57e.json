Or what Steve Case might have done for PepsiCo if he hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t left for a gaming start-up that eventually became AOL. What if Salomon Brothers had kept Michael Bloomberg, or Bear Stearns had exploited the inventive ideas of Stephen Ross?\n\nScores of top-tier entrepreneurs worked for established corporations before they struck out on their own and became self-made billionaires. People like Mark Cuban, John Paul DeJoria, Sara Blakely, and T. Boone Pickens all built businessesÃ¢â‚¬â€in some cases, multiple businessesÃ¢â‚¬â€that are among todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most iconic brands. This fact raises two profound questions: Why couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t their former employers hang on to to these extraordinarily talented people? And why are most big companies unable to create as much new value as the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s roughly 800 self-made billionaires?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b078d822c39b0f3281b2200d07691841e4b7b57e","amp;dn":"The+Self-made+Billionaire+Effect%3A+How+Extreme+Producers+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b078d822c39b0f3281b2200d07691841e4b7b57e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,120,216,34,195,155,15,50,129,178,32,13,7,105,24,65,228,183,181,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
