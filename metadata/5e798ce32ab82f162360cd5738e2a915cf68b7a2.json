This heralded a string of successes, including A Streetcar Named Desire, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Orpheus Descending, and Sweet Bird of Youth. His later work attempted a new style that did not appeal to audiences, and alcohol and drug dependence further inhibited his creative output.\n\nWilliams adapted much of his best work for the cinema, and also wrote short stories, poetry, essays and a volume of memoirs. In 1979, four years before his death, he was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\nThe torrent contains all the books in PDF format unless otherwise stated:\n\n*  A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) -- ePUB\n\n* Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1955)\n\n* Sweet Bird of Youth (1959)\n\n* The Glass Menagerie (1950) -- ePUB\n\n* The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore (1963)\n\n* The Night of the Iguana (1961)\n\n* The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone (1950), novel\n\n* The Rose Tattoo (1951)\n\n\nRead the following article, interviews, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Williams&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Williams&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3209/the-art-of-theater-no-5-tennessee-williams&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3209/the-art-of-theater-no-5-tennessee-williams&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/books/00/12/31/specials/williams-interview75.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/books/00/12/31/specials/williams-interview75.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e798ce32ab82f162360cd5738e2a915cf68b7a2","amp;dn":"Tennessee+Williams+-+The+Glass+Menagerie+and+Other+Works+%288+Book","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e798ce32ab82f162360cd5738e2a915cf68b7a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,121,140,227,42,184,47,22,35,96,205,87,56,226,169,21,207,104,183,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
