Pichardo briefly left the group due to the Mexican listening public's lack of interest in electronic and synth music. When Lozano decided to leave MÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“nia as vocalist and form the still electronically oriented but more guitar-centered Morbo, despite the acclaimed success of 1997's MÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“nia and its subsequent album of remixes (a risky and previously unheard of novelty in the Mexican music industry), Pichardo reunited with the remaining two of his former bandmates to complete MÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“nia's line-up, which has remained unchanged since 1999.\n\nAlbums in this torrent:\n\n1.
