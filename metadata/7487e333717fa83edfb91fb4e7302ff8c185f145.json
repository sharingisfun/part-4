There, Arnold and his collaborators investigate temperature, carbonation, sugar concentration, and acidity in search of ways to enhance classic cocktails and invent new ones that revolutionize your expectations about what a drink can look and taste like.\nYears of rigorous experimentation and studyÃ¢â‚¬â€botched attempts and inspired solutionsÃ¢â‚¬â€have yielded the recipes and techniques found in these pages. Featuring more than 120 recipes and nearly 450 color photographs, Liquid Intelligence begins with the simpleÃ¢â‚¬â€how ice forms and how to make crystal-clear cubes in your own freezerÃ¢â‚¬â€and then progresses into advanced techniques like clarifying cloudy lime juice with enzymes, nitro-muddling fresh basil to prevent browning, and infusing vodka with coffee, orange, or peppercorns.\nPractical tips for preparing drinks by the pitcher, making homemade sodas, and building a specialized bar in your own home are exactly what drink enthusiasts need to know. For devotees seeking the cutting edge, chapters on liquid nitrogen, chitosan/gellan washing, and the applications of a centrifuge expand the boundaries of traditional cocktail craft.\nArnoldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book is the beginning of a new method of making drinks, a problem-solving approach grounded in attentive observation and creative techniques. Readers will learn how to extract the sweet flavor of peppers without the spice, why bottling certain drinks beforehand beats shaking them at the bar, and why quinine powder and succinic acid lead to the perfect gin and tonic.\nLiquid Intelligence is about satisfying your curiosity and refining your technique, from red-hot pokers to the elegance of an old-fashioned. Whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in search of astounding drinks or a one-of-a-kind journey into the next generation of cocktail making, Liquid Intelligence is the ultimate standardÃ¢â‚¬â€one that no bartender or drink enthusiast should be without","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7487e333717fa83edfb91fb4e7302ff8c185f145","amp;dn":"Liquid+Intelligence%3A+The+Art+And+Science+Of+The+Perfect+Cocktail","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7487e333717fa83edfb91fb4e7302ff8c185f145","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,135,227,51,113,127,168,62,223,185,31,180,231,48,47,248,193,133,241,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
