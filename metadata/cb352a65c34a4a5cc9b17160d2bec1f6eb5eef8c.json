Besides the I-love-it-immediately sound of &quot;Soul Makossa&quot; their are other outstanding tracks including the very similar but much faster tempo of &quot;Big Blow&quot; that will blow your socks off, the historical recording &quot;Dikalo&quot; which was a forerunner and echoes &quot;Soul Makossa,&quot; the Latin-influenced &quot;Hot Chicken&quot; that features Dibango's blistering sax, the childhood memories inspired song (a river in Cameroon), &quot;Wouri,&quot; that features Manu on alto sax and piano with nice orchestration, &quot;Goro City&quot; that features the reaggae-driven beat of Jamaican beatmiesters Sly and Robbie Shakespeare that fuses well with the Lion of Cameroons sax, &quot;Senga Abele&quot; an often sampled song that mixes the rap of M.C. Mello with the funky-cool sax of Dibango and African singers for a true world beat sound and finally the classic title track from the excellent disc &quot;Wakafrika&quot; that will have your head bopping and feat aching to move. \nManu Dibango has always been ahead of the musical curve and this disc proves just that. It would be hard to find a grittier-funky sound out there. Check it out if you like jazz, funk or world music; it's all here on this disc.
