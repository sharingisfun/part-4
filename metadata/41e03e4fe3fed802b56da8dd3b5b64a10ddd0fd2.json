A mousy letter carrier makes dough balls she \ngrotesquely ingests before bed. A shop clerk fixates on a TV news reader while he builds a machine to massage and masturbate him. One of his customers makes an elaborate chicken costume for a voodoo-like scene with a doll resembling his plump neighbor. She, in turn, has a doll that resembles him, which she whips and dominates in an abandoned church. The TV news reader has her own fantasy involving carp. Her husband, who is indifferent to her, steals materials to fashion elaborate artifacts that he rubs, scrapes and rolls across his body.\n\nI HAVE A LOT OF WIERD MOVIES BUT IÃ‚Â´M ONLY GOING TO UPPLOAD THEM IF YOU DOWNLOADERS SEEDING THEM! \n\nSEED AS LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE! \n\n'If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, this torrent will NEVER DIE' \n[thanks to cor for that] \n\n\nMy movies so far: \nFando y Lis \nThe holy mountain \nEl topo \nSanta Sangre \nUzumaki \nThe happiness of the katakuris \nSession 9 \nThe great silence \nFAUST \nAn Andalusian Dog \nThe Rainbow thief \nGlen or Glenda \nALICE \nThe Exterminating Angel \nViva la muerte \nBride of the monster \nThe Nine Lives of Tomas Katz \nConspirators of Pleasure \nBEGOTTEN\n\nDo you like really fucked-up, weird flicks?
