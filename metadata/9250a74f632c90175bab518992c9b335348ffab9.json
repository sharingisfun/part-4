The track spent four weeks as the No. 1 pop song on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and was fourth in the Billboard year-end chart of 1967 and earned her Grammy awards for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 1968. Gentry charted eleven singles on the Billboard Hot 100 and four singles on the United Kingdom Top 40.\n\nHer album Fancy brought her a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. After her first albums, she had a successful run of variety shows on the Las Vegas Strip. She lost interest in performing in the late 1970s, and since has lived privately in Los Angeles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9250a74f632c90175bab518992c9b335348ffab9","amp;dn":"Bobbie+Gentry+-+Discography+1967-71+%286+Albums%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9250a74f632c90175bab518992c9b335348ffab9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,80,167,79,99,44,144,23,91,171,81,137,146,201,179,53,52,143,250,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
