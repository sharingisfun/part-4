Creating music of many extremes, and with compositions often exceeding ten minutes in length, Ne Obliviscaris is at times very technical and complex and at others simple and subtle, creating an extremely original brand of metal that defies normal categorisation.\nCode\nCurrent Members:\n\n\n  - Tim Charles: Violin (2003-present), Vocals (clean) (2004-present)\n\n  - Xenoyr: Vocals (harsh) (2003-present) Matt Klavins Guitars (2004-present)\n\n  - Brendan &quot;Cygnus&quot; Brown: Bass (2005-present)\n\n  - Daniel &quot;Mortuary&quot; Presland: Drums (2005-2011, 2012-present)\n\n  - Benjamin Baret: Guitars (lead) (2009-present)\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n\n  1.
