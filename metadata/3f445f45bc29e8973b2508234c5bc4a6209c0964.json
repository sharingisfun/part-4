Georges Picquart is the ambitious, intellectual, recently promoted head of the counterespionage agency that helped convict Dreyfus of treason. Picquart staunchly believes in Dreyfus's guilt-even after he witnesses the man's protestations of innocence in front of twenty thousand spectators baying &quot;Death to the Jew!&quot; But gradually Picquart comes to suspect that a spy remains at large in the military. With evidence mounting, pointing to deceit at the highest levels of government, Picquart has nowhere to turn and is compelled to question his most deeply held beliefs about his country and himself. Bringing to life the scandal that mesmerized the world at the turn of the twentieth century, Harris tells a tale of uncanny timeliness-a whistle-blower, a witch hunt of a minority, secret tribunals, out-of-control intelligence agencies, government corruption, a cover-up-richly, dramatized with the storytelling mastery that has marked all of his internationally best-selling novels.\n\n\nFrom the Hardcover edition.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f445f45bc29e8973b2508234c5bc4a6209c0964","amp;dn":"Harris_Robert-An_Officer_and_a_Spy.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f445f45bc29e8973b2508234c5bc4a6209c0964","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,68,95,69,188,41,232,151,59,37,8,35,76,91,196,166,32,156,9,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
