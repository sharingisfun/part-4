In 1996, the two guitarists gathered over the course of several sessions and chose various instruments, often using several within one track via overdubbing. The two guitarists play together on just five of the 17 tracks, with Taylor playing ten solos and Howe two. Taylor's unusual setting of Kenny Dorham's &quot;Blue Bossa&quot; incorporates one guitar for rhythm, while he switches off among 18 other instruments for the solo. His setting of &quot;All the Things You Are&quot; adds a surprising lyrical introduction, while the arrangement contrasts with the typically over the top bop recordings. Howe's spacious &quot;Tailpiece&quot; suggests a lonely journey in the desert. Taylor also penned several originals, including the tasty bossa nova &quot;Cherokee Ridge.&quot; Among the duo features, the enchanting, understated interpretation of &quot;Smile&quot; has a special appeal. This session will be of special interest to guitarists, though anyone familiar with either Martin Taylor or Steve Howe ought to investigate this enjoyable CD. (Allmusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01.
