This isn't your retarded classical top 100 mozart collection, this is real repertoire.\n\nAll of the symphonies, piano concertos, preludes are here, along with some various other pieces (etudes tableaux, vespers, isle of the dead)\n\nEncoded in FLAC compression-level 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Tagging is done as follows:\nArtist == Composer\nAlbum == Name of the work\nTitle == Title of a part or movement in a work\nGenre == The performer(s)\nTrack == Merely orders the files within a folder so that the files will be organised if there is more than one performer for a certain piece.\n\nI've done filenames as &quot;%PARENT_DIR%/Album/Track. [Performer] Title&quot;\n\n\n\nIf there are any skips or pops in the files that I have missed, please comment and I will fix and upload that piece.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9be421aaba2a107f00158594c3e8ef00d045e40","amp;dn":"Classical+Music+-+Rachmaninov+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9be421aaba2a107f00158594c3e8ef00d045e40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,190,66,26,171,162,161,7,240,1,88,89,76,62,142,240,13,4,94,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
