It is rich with stunning photographs taken from the original glass negatives of the 1922 dig and vivid color photos that are still unsurpassed by todays digital imaging. The majority of artifacts of this 70's era United States tour were, unfortunately, not included in the recent 2006 exhibit. One such object is Tut's gold funerary mask that, by modern Egyptian law, can no longer leave the country","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6f032284a5877cfbd6cc7b4e3af5042fdb32c34","amp;dn":"Treasures+of+Tutankhamun%2C+National+Gallery+of+Art.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6f032284a5877cfbd6cc7b4e3af5042fdb32c34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,240,50,40,74,88,119,207,189,108,199,180,227,175,80,66,253,179,44,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
