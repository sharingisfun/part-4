With their army of Silver Spears, their elite company of Blade Maidens, and their holy defenders, the terrifying asirim, the Kings uphold their positions as undisputed, invincible lords of the desert. There is no hope of freedom for any under their rule.\r\n\r\nOr so it seems, until Ã‡eda, a brave young woman from the west end slums, defies the Kingsâ€™ laws by going outside on the holy night of Beht Zhaâ€™ir. What she learns that night sets her on a path that winds through both the terrible truths of the Kingsâ€™ mysterious history and the hidden riddles of her own heritage. Together, these secrets could finally break the iron grip of the Kingsâ€™ power...if the nigh-omnipotent Kings donâ€™t find her first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Sarah Coomes\r\nFormat: MP3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:324d87dd70ab1a72f4d061e700075a45900d04f4","amp;dn":"Bradley+P.+Beaulieu+-+Twelve+Kings+in+Sharakhai+%28The+Song+of+the","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"324d87dd70ab1a72f4d061e700075a45900d04f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,77,135,221,112,171,26,114,244,208,97,231,0,7,90,69,144,13,4,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
