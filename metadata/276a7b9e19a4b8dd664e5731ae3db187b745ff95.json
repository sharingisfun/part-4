During the race you will battle the Cardassians, ally with the Klingons, \ninvestigate the unpredictable Romulans and reveal a secret plot that threatens the Federation itself.\n\nThe excitement and the challenges grow as you and your crew race to find the cause through over \n30 different missions. \nThese will include many of Star Trek&amp;#039;s most fundamental elements - defense, combat, diplomacy, \nexploration, rescue, and scientific discovery. For the first time you will be able to command \nboth Galaxy and Sovereign class ships much like the U.S.S. Enterprise-D and U.S.S. Enterprise-E.\n\nThe question is -- can you keep your cool while bulkheads fail? Will you save your crew, \nsave the colonists and defend the Federation from a new threat?\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPublisher: Activision\nDeveloper: Totally Games\nGenre: Space Combat Sim\nRelease Date: Feb 27, 2002\nESRB: EVERYONE\nGame Information\nNumber of Players: 1-8\n\nMinimum System Requirements\nWindows 95/98/ME/2000/xp and works on vista\nSystem: PII 450 or equivalent\nRAM: 64 MB\nVideo Memory: 16 MB\nHard Drive Space: 650 MB\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Extract with latest Winrar or 7zip.\n*Start with stbc.exe in game folder.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPLEASE SEED WHEN YOU FINISH THE DOWNLOAD\n\nEnjoy!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:276a7b9e19a4b8dd664e5731ae3db187b745ff95","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+Bridge+Commander+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"276a7b9e19a4b8dd664e5731ae3db187b745ff95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,106,123,158,25,164,184,221,102,78,87,49,174,61,177,135,183,69,255,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
