Don Quixote is the mad, aging nobleman who embarrasses his respectable family by his adventures. Backed by his faithful sidekick Sancho Panza, he duels windmills and defends his perfect lady Dulcinea (who is actually a downtrodden whore named Aldonza). Written by Reid Gagle\n\nIn the sixteenth century, Miguel de Cervantes, poet, playwright, and part-time actor, has been arrested, together with his manservant, by the Spanish Inquisition. They are accused of presenting an entertainment offensive to the Inquisition. Inside the huge dungeon into which they have been cast, the other prisoners gang up on Cervantes and his manservant, and begin a mock trial, with the intention of stealing or burning his possessions. Cervantes wishes to desperately save a manuscript he carries with him and stages, with costumes, makeup, and the participation of the other prisoners, an unusual defense--the story of Don Quixote.\n\n\nCast:\nPeter O'Toole\t... \tDon Quixote de La Mancha / Miguel de Cervantes / Alonso Quijana\nSophia Loren\t... \tDulcinea / Aldonza\nJames Coco\t... \tSancho Panza / Cervantes' s Manservant\nHarry Andrews\t... \tThe Innkeeper / The Governor\nJohn Castle\t... \tSanson Carrasco / The Duke\nBrian Blessed\t... \tPedro\nIan Richardson\t... \tThe Padre\nJulie Gregg\t... \tAntonia Quijana\nRosalie Crutchley\t... \tThe Housekeeper\nGino Conforti\t... \tThe Barber\nMarne Maitland\t... \tCaptain of the Guard\nDorothy Sinclair\t... \tThe Innkeeper's Wife\nMiriam Acevedo\t... \tFermina\nDominic Barto\t... \tMuleteer (como Dominic BartÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³)\nPoldo Bendandi\t... \tMuleteer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a7762516dfb0f241473ce4d6613003e0d5424ec","amp;dn":"Man+of+La+Mancha+%281972%29+%5BDivX%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a7762516dfb0f241473ce4d6613003e0d5424ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,119,98,81,109,251,15,36,20,115,206,77,102,19,0,62,13,84,36,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
