ColtraneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thirst for new sounds is fundamentally intertwined with his desire to see the universe from a new, higher perspective, and this is why his music exudes its spiritual, even cosmic aura. \n\n\nJohn Coltrane\n\nLive in Japan\n\n1966\n\n\n  4CDs / 1991 / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nDisc 1: \n\n1.
