The term also refers to the associated dance styles and fashions that emanated from the Twisted Wheel club in Manchester and spread to other dancehalls and nightclubs, such as the Golden Torch (in Stoke-upon-Trent), the Highland Rooms at the Blackpool Mecca and the Wigan Casino. Northern soul dancing was usually athletic, resembling the later dance styles of disco and break dancing. Featuring spins, flips, and backdrops, the northern soul dancing style was inspired by the stage performances of visiting American soul acts.\nUnquestionably the World\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s most famous Soul Club, not only nationally, but internationally as well.

None of this at the Casino! It served no alcohol whatsoever, it was too hot and sweaty to wear a suit, although we did and changed into our dancing clothes ready to do the business, and for the most part men and women ignored each other, unless of course they were discussing the latest soul releases. Forgiving our American Friends their ignorance the Casino was never a Disco, it was a Soul Club.\nDespite not having the same financial baxkers as the Blackpool Mecca did the Casino was still remarkably successful in unearthing unknown soul obscurities. It also boasted a big turnaround of live American acts. This was not the main reason for its legendary reputation however as both the Torch and the Twisted Wheel brought them over on a more regular basis. It was much more to do with the venue itself which had begun life as a large post-Victorian theatre before turning into a Snooker hall. By the time it became a Soul Club it was more than a little dilapidated but was perfect for the soul lover\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s tastes.

There was plenty of seating downstairs where people could sit and replenish their bodily fluids purely on soft drinks. Just like the Mecca it also had a secondary room known as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;Mr M\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039; which opened a couple of hours after the doors had opened. This room was purely oldies and concentrated exclusively on sixties Soul. The Casino had a predominantly R&amp;B policy making it rare to hear anything with a funky influence, although a few did find their way to the turntables, nor did it concentrate exclusively on obscurities as normal issues were well integrated into the Casino playlists. This may well have been a significant factor in the Casino\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s success as any new member would almost certainly hear something with which they were familiar.\nUnfortunately the Casino\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s success may well have contributed to its demise because as its reputation grew so did its commercial viability. At one stage it could boast a membership of over 100,000 people. Record companies started exploiting Northern Soul favourites by pushing them into the pop charts. White Bands such as Soft Cell started making poor cover versions of the Casino\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s discoveries in a bid for commercial success. Silly dancers appeared on Top Of The Pops calling themselves \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;Wigan\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Chosen Few\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039; but the main reason was that DJ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s were seduced by the hype and promises of untold riches.Instead of it being a cool underground movement it became embarrasing. The authentic Soul records of the sixties had SUPPOSEDLY all been \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;DISCOVERED\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;, try telling the Soulies of  today that, so in an attempt to find new sounds they started introducing soul influenced pop songs and tried to pass them off as the genuine article ~ in other words \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;crap\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;!. Alot of the true Soul Fans moved on as the Casino became increasingly populated by curious trendies all wanting to jump on the Northern Soul bandwagon. As well as the introduction of crap music there was the newcommers who only came along to take speed and pretend to be a part of the scene.\nOn December 6th. 1981 its doors closed for the last time as the local Council shut it down due to the bad reputation the club was getting from the regular drug busts and the local thugs trying to fight the soulies at the local hot dog van apart from the criminal element surrounding the amphetemines.. A few months later in a freak accident the Casino caught fire and was razed to the ground. Despite its later loss of direction the Casino will forever remain a treasured memory for those who were fortunate enough to attend.

Supposedly ther has been 6 more coppies surface but only rumours )\nI have been on the Northern Soul scene for many years as Promoter, Dj and total freak. And thought it was about time to put a bit back into the scene that causes me to have so many memories and so many sleepless nights.\nThis torrent is compiled by me and ripped by myself and other friends on the scene ( Thanks alot guys ~ Keep the Faith ). Although it was bloody hard putting these together I cant begin to tell ya the fun I had and the memories it brought back playing some of these for the first time in a while. I was asked by many to make these torrents a smaller size and to put them into cattegories so this I have painstakingly done, and made several of the very best Northern Soul compilations money can buy ( If you can find them that is ).\nAll that is left for me to say is ENJOY and to please seed for a while as we need to get these rarities out there\n. \nunionjack ( Soul ~ As Deep As You Like and Some )\nThe 3 Degrees\tContact\t2:33\nA Case of Thyme\tManifesto\t3:22\nAdams Apples\tDont take it out on this world\t2:02\nAd~libs\tNothings worse than being alone\t2:42\nAl Wilson\tThe Snake\t3:29\nAlice Clark\tYou hit me\t2:53\nAnn Sexton\tYouve been gone too long\t2:16\nAren Demain\tSilent Treatment\t2:55\nAstral Trip\t\t2:33\nBrooks and Jerry\tI got what it takes\t2:32\nBarry Gray\tJoe90 Theme\t2:14\nBenny Spellman\tFortune teller\t2:12\nBernie Williams\tEver again\t2:33\nBetty Boo\tSay it isnt so\t2:57\nBeverley Ann\tYouve got your mind on other things2:19\nBilly Prophet\tWhat can I do\t2:03\nBilly Watkins\tThe Iceman\t2:16\nBobby James \tI really love you\t2:22\nBobby Lawson\tBurning sensation\t2:02\nBobby Mac\tShy guy\t2:21\nBobby Paris\tI walked away\t3:04\nBobby Paris\tPer~so~nally\t2:16\nBobby Treetop\tWait till I get to know ya\t2:27\nBobby Wells\tBe that ways sometimes\t2:56\nBoots Randolph\tTake a letter Maria\t2:05\nBurning Bush\tKeep on talking\t2:24\nBurning Spear\tBurning Spear\t2:36\nCandi Staton\tNow you got the upper hand\t1:55\nCapreez\tHow to make a sadman glad\t2:01\nLittle Carl Carlton\tSo what\t3:07\nCase of thyme\tManifesto\t3:21\nCashmeres\tShowstopper\t2:05\nCavaliers\tHold on to my baby\t2:29\nCavaliers\tOoh it hurts me\t2:34\nCharlie Gracie\tHe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;ll never love you like I do\t2:19\nCollins and Collins\tAt the top of the stairs\t4:41\nCompared to what\tMr Floods Party\t3:48\nConnie Clark\tMy sugar baby\t2:46\nCrackin up over you\tRoy Hamilton\t2:18\nCreation\tFever\t2:57\nCurtis Mayfield\tMove on up\t3:40\nDanny Wagner\tI lost a true love\t1:58\nDarrell Banks\tAngel Baby\t2:53\nDarrow Fletcher\tWhat good am I without you\t2:24\nDean Courtney\tIll always need you\t2:10\nDean Parish\tIm on my way\t2:43\nDel Larks\tJob opening (part 1)\t2:57\nDee Lites\tLover\t2:05\nDena Barnes\tIf you ever walk out of my life\t2:24\nDianna Ross supremes\tHoney Bee\t2:30\nDonnie Burdick\tBari track\t2:40\nDon Thomas\tCome on train\t3:15\nDrifters\tPay your dues\t2:34\nDuettes\tEvery beat of my heart\t2:44\nEddie and Ernie\tI cant do it\t2:09\nEddie Foster\tI never knew\t2:28\nEddie Holman\tWhere Im not wanted\t2:44\nEde Robin\tThere must be love \t2:04\nEloise Laws \tLove factory\t3:35\nEpitome of sound\tYou dont love me\t2:43\t\nEsther Phillips\tWhat a difference a day makes   4:31\nFascinations\tGirls are out to get ya\t2:09\nFlirtations\tStronger than her love\t2:51\nFour perfections\tIm not strong enough\t2:24\nFrank Wilson\tDo I love you\t2:33\nFrankie &amp;
