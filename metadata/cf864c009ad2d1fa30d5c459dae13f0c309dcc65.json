New installments are released in six full-colour page episodes every week,[2][3] a schedule that allows the story the chance to grow naturally.[4]\n\nThe story grew out of Ellis' question as to what would have happened if the Midwich Cuckoos had survived and grown to &quot;disaffected and confused twenty-one-year-olds.&quot; The story builds on the legacy of John Wyndham's style of disaster fiction.[5]\n\nThe series will run for 144 episodes, completing on Friday, August 5th, 2011.\n\nEllis' synopsis of the plot involves characters &quot;living in a post-flood London that they might possibly have had something to do with.&quot;[1] The so-called FreakAngels, who possess telepathy and many other &quot;special&quot; abilities, such as space-time manipulation/distortion, and pyrokinesis, live in Whitechapel.[3]\n\nAs the story progresses, eleven of the FreakAngels are introduced and their role in the community is expanded. For the most part cooperatively they have created a small community of roughly three hundred people with fresh water, watch towers, markets, home-grown vegetables and a medical clinic. Their society is threatened, however, externally from refugee attacks and internally from personal conflicts and crime.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf864c009ad2d1fa30d5c459dae13f0c309dcc65","amp;dn":"Freak+Angels+Complete+1-144+by+Warren+Ellis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf864c009ad2d1fa30d5c459dae13f0c309dcc65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,134,76,0,154,210,209,250,48,213,196,89,218,225,63,12,48,157,204,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
