Although the 24fps material consists mostly of the  |\n| present-day landscape scenes (arguably the prettiest parts of each        |\n| episode), they comprise only 10-25% of each episode, so it was decided    |\n| that it would be better to keep the original 30fps frame rate.            |\n|                                                                           |\n| Container format: Although the MKV format is more efficient, the space    |\n| savings would have been insignificant relative to the size of each        |\n| episode, and the use of AVI ensures that each episode can be &quot;natively&quot;   |\n| played by Windows 7, with no need for any additional software.            |\n|                                                                           |\n| A small portion of episode 3 was lost due to glitches; this was repaired  |\n| by splicing in the same scenes from a different source recording.         |\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| PLEASE support your local public media stations by donating during their  |\n| pledge drives or by purchasing their DVDs!                                |\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a61934bf3cdb9d799ea2a5c0d20873cee7a6cb0d","amp;dn":"PBS%3A+The+National+Parks%2C+America%5C%27s+Best+Idea+%28720p%2C+complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a61934bf3cdb9d799ea2a5c0d20873cee7a6cb0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,25,52,191,60,219,157,121,158,162,165,192,210,8,115,206,231,166,203,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
