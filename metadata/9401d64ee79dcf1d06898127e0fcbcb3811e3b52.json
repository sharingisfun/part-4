According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Baywatch is the most watched TV show in the world of all time, with over 1.1 billion viewers a week.[5]\n\nBaywatch premiered on NBC in 1990, but was cancelled after only one season due to low ratings and also because the studio, GTG, went out of business.[4] Feeling the series still had potential, David Hasselhoff, creators and Executive Producers Michael Berk, Douglas Schwartz and Greg Bonann revived it for the first-run syndication market in 1991. Hasselhoff was given the title of Executive Producer for his work on bringing the show back. The series was hugely successful, especially internationally.[6] [7] The show led to a spin-off: Baywatch Nights, and a reunion movie, Baywatch: Hawaiian Wedding.\n\nIn 1999, with production costs rising in Los Angeles, and the syndication market shrinking, the plan was to move the show to Australia and launch Baywatch Down Under. A pilot was filmed but the series was stopped when residents of Avalon put forth strong objections, including potential damage to a fragile ecosystem. The Avalon city council permanently barred all future filming.[8][9] The pilot finally aired as a two-part episode of Baywatch.\n\nHawaii offered the producers large financial incentives to move the show to the islands and in Season 10 Baywatch Hawaii was launched.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9401d64ee79dcf1d06898127e0fcbcb3811e3b52","amp;dn":"Baywatch+-+1+season","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9401d64ee79dcf1d06898127e0fcbcb3811e3b52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,1,214,78,231,157,207,29,6,137,129,39,224,252,188,179,129,30,59,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
