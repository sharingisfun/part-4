Divide and Rule\n\nThough Birgitte is surprised at the defence minister's choice of new fighter jets, she allows him to make public the decision on the government's behalf. When unpleasant surprises surface in the wake of the big plane purchase, the media launch an offensive against members of parliament. Meanwhile, Birgitte becomes more and more controlling both at work and at home, costing her dearly. Katrine is really on her toes but runs into problems with her boss when she acts too arbitrarily.\n\n\nBirgitte Nyborg Christensen  -  Sidse Babett Knudsen\nMichael Laugesen   -  Peter Mygind\nBent Sejro  -  Lars Knutzon\nPhilip Christensen  -  Mikael Birkkjaer\nKasper Juul  -  Pilou Asbak\nKatrine Fonsmark  -  Birgitte Hjort Sorensen\nTorben Friis  -  Soren Malling\nHanne Holm  -  Benedikte Hansen\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4a6d8bed7e8e1fdf27691536baf804ee3f94229","amp;dn":"Borgen.BBC.S01E09","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4a6d8bed7e8e1fdf27691536baf804ee3f94229","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,166,216,190,215,232,225,253,242,118,145,83,107,175,128,78,227,249,66,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
