For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two\nways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements, where youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re\nrestricted to 2,000 calories of badly flavored soy every day. You can\nhope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling\noff-world, or you can join the service. With the colony lottery a pipe\ndream, Andrew chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real\nfood, a retirement bonus, and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts\na career of supposed privilege, he soon learns that the good food and\ndecent health care come at a steep priceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and that the settled galaxy\nholds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats or the gangs that\nrule the slums.\nThe debut novel from Marko Kloos, Terms of Enlistment is a new addition\nto the great military sci-fi tradition of Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman,\nand John Scalzi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3ce26359297f8175550b7ebb46d7cb36a6b1301","amp;dn":"Marko+Kloos+-+Terms+of+Enlistment","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3ce26359297f8175550b7ebb46d7cb36a6b1301","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,206,38,53,146,151,248,23,85,80,183,235,180,109,124,179,106,107,19,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
