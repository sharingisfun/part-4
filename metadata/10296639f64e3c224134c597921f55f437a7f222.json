This is a VHS rip of the OFFICIAL APPLE/MPI release, which was digitally remastered directly from the negative and with sound remixed and remastered by GEORGE MARTIN. This version is far more superior to the DVD that was released by Avenue One Entertainment. \n\n\n\n\n&quot;Away in the sky, beyond the clouds, live 4 or 5 Magicians. By casting wonderful spells they turn the Most Ordinary Coach Trip into a Magical Mystery Tour. If you let yourself go, the Magicians will take you away to marvellous places. Maybe you've been on a Magical Mystery Tour without even realising it. Are you ready to go?\nSplendid!&quot;\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10296639f64e3c224134c597921f55f437a7f222","amp;dn":"THE+BEATLES++-+MAGICAL+MYSTERY+TOUR+%5BMOVIE%5D+%7E+OFFICIAL+HQ+%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10296639f64e3c224134c597921f55f437a7f222","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,41,102,57,246,78,60,34,65,52,197,151,146,31,85,244,55,167,242,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
