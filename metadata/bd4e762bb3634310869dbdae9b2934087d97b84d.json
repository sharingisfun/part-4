There is no denying that Nicola Sacco (Riccardo Cucciolla) and Bartolomeo Vanzetti (Gian Maria VolontÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨) were anarchists. But it is highly doubtful that Sacco and Vanzetti were guilty of murder. However, their trial took place at the height of the 1920s &quot;Red Scare,&quot; so there was little opportunity for the two men to receive fair treatment. Despite worldwide protests from politicians, intellectuals, and &quot;average Joes,&quot; Sacco and Vanzetti were executed on August 23, 1927, after spending nearly seven years on death row. Like most TV and film accounts of this story, Sacco and Vanzetti is clearly sympathetic to the main characters.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Sacco &amp; Vanzetti.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 58mn\n      Bit rate : 1643 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 18.0 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n      IAS1 : Italiano\n      IAS2 : Italiano\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Custom\n      PlayTime : 1h 58mn\n      Bit rate : 1337 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 368 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 16/9\n      Frame rate : 29.970 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.187\n      StreamSize : 1.11 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 1h 58mn\n      Bit rate : 191 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 163 MiB\n   Audio #2\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 58mn\n      Bit rate : 105 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 89.0 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.97 \n      Encoding settings : ABR\n\nIMDB: tt0067698\n\nItalian audio, English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd4e762bb3634310869dbdae9b2934087d97b84d","amp;dn":"Sacco+e+Vanzetti+%281971%29+-+Montaldo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd4e762bb3634310869dbdae9b2934087d97b84d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,78,118,43,179,99,67,16,134,157,189,174,155,41,52,8,125,151,184,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
