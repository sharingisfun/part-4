He asks the iCarly team to help him restore this image, but a first attempt to regain his popularity fails. After he offers a sincere apology to the girl on iCarly, he gets many positive comments again, but when a handicapped man bumps into him with his wheelchair shortly afterwards, Nevel starts screaming at the man and is filmed yet again. \nMeanwhile, Freddie is becoming popular with girls after playing a vampire in an iCarly short film. He deeply enjoys this situation, but shortly afterwards, his popularity fades as werewolves become more popular than vampires. Gibby then dresses up as a werewolf and steals Freddie's date.
