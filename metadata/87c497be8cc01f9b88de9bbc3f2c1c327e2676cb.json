A conscripted soldier is beginning to consider her life after the war and the family she has left behind. But for ScurÃ¢â‚¬â€and for humanityÃ¢â‚¬â€peace is not to be.\n\nOn the brink of the ceasefire, Scur is captured by a renegade war criminal, and left for dead in the ruins of a bunker. She revives aboard a prisoner transport vessel. Something has gone terribly wrong with the ship.\n\nPassengersÃ¢â‚¬â€combatants from both sides of the warÃ¢â‚¬â€are waking up from hibernation far too soon. Their memories, embedded in bullets, are the only links to a world which is no longer recognizable. And Scur will be reacquainted with her old enemy, but with much higher stakes than just her own life.\n\n\nRead by Susan Duerden\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87c497be8cc01f9b88de9bbc3f2c1c327e2676cb","amp;dn":"Alastair+Reynolds+-+Slow+Bullets","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87c497be8cc01f9b88de9bbc3f2c1c327e2676cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,196,151,190,140,192,31,155,136,222,155,188,63,44,28,50,126,38,118,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
