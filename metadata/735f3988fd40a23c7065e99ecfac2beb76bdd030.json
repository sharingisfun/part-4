Although War's lyrics were sometimes political in nature (in keeping with their racially integrated lineup), their music almost always had a sunny, laid-back vibe emblematic of their Southern California roots. War kept the groove loose, and they were given over to extended jamming -- in fact, many of their studio songs were edited together out of longer improvisations. Even if the jams sometimes got indulgent, they demonstrated War's truly group-minded approach: no one soloist or vocalist really stood above the others (even though all were clearly talented), and their grooving interplay placed War in the top echelon of funk ensembles.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tR&amp;B\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Spill The Wine\n02.Tobacco Road\n03.All Day Music\n04.Slippin' Into Darkness\n05.The World Is A Ghetto\n06.The Cisco Kid\n07.City Country City\n08.Gypsy Man\n09.Me And Baby Brother\n10.Why Can't We Be Friends\n11.Low Rider\n12.Summer\n13.Galaxy 2000\n14.Outlaw\n15.You Got The Power\n16.East L.A.\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Slippin' Into Darkness (Armand Van Helden Remix)\n02.Low Rider (Ganja Kru Remix)\n03.Galaxy 2000 (Plump DJs Remix)\n04.Outlaw (Orinoko Remix)\n05.You Got The Power (Peter Reis Remix)\n06.The World Is A Ghetto (La Pozze Latina Remix)\n07.Why Can't We Be Friends (Hithunter Remix)\n08.Tobacco Road (Soundprops Remix)\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:735f3988fd40a23c7065e99ecfac2beb76bdd030","amp;dn":"War+-+Grooves+%26+Messages+Greatest+Hits+%281999%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"735f3988fd40a23c7065e99ecfac2beb76bdd030","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,95,57,136,253,64,162,60,112,101,233,158,207,172,43,235,118,189,208,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
