It is not an epic dirgy sludge of trailer-making strings. It is pure in its detail and beauty and is designed to encourage and inspire you to write better orchestral music for your canon.\n\nMural also features many scripting and sampling innovations developed when producing our seminal Sable range and comes with the full feature set and intuitive GUI developed for the whole of the BML range. As you would expect with BML, Mural will feature a comprehensive selection of microphone perspectives and labour saving Jake Jackson mixes. Mural also has some additional expression features including intensity, tightness and control of release triggers to give even more human elements and a further ability to tweak.\n\n=======[ Instruction ]===============================================================\n\n- Open Kontakt 5.3\n- Go to File tab\n- Browse for the torrent folder\n- Drag n Drop the NKI files into the Right Panel to use.\n\n=======[ Extra ]=====================================================================\n\nI DO NOT OWN THIS PRODUCT - IF YOU ENJOY IT, PLEASE CONSIDER BUYING TO SUPPORT OWNER!\n\n=======[ Greets ]====================================================================\n\nGreeting to awesome uploaders:\n\n- deepstatus\n- datsn1pah\n- imafaggot\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea36009d65b81238d4ab2d4945254b1ed4872a43","amp;dn":"Spitfire+Audio+-+BML+Mural+Volume+1+%5BKONTAKT%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea36009d65b81238d4ab2d4945254b1ed4872a43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,54,0,157,101,184,18,56,212,171,45,73,69,37,75,30,212,135,42,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
