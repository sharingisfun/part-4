This is the follow up in what I hope will be a series of bootlegs covering McCartney's most recent &quot;Out There&quot; tour. The source for this material is professional concert footage taken by the Bonnaroo concert organizers themselves. I hope you all enjoy this material. If you do, please look into my previous installment by searching TPB for the previously mentioned title. P.S. It is my opinion that the audio quality in this material is sub-par, but is the best I could possibly offer.
