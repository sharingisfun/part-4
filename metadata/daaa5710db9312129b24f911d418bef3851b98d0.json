He and the crew of the Odysseus must hunt down those who unleashed the hellish attack on his homeworld and that of Earthâ€™s Priminae allies.\r\n\r\nBut the situation turns dire when they catch sight of a ship belonging to the mysterious beings who orchestrate the fearsome Drasinâ€™s depredations. This powerful Empire, it seems, has two primary aims: to conquer new worlds and settle old scores.
