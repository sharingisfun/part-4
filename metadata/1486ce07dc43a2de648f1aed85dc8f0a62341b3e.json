Baker is aided and abetted by American tenorman and flutist Bobby Jaspar and propelled by the exhuberant Daniel Humair, Europe's answer to the sensational hard bop drummer Philly Joe Jones.  Although Chet is primarily known as an interpreter of wispy ballads and standards, he stands out on this set as an advanced, aggressive be-bop improviser.  His playing on the Thelonious Monk classic 'Well, You Needn't' and high-speed romp through 'Pent-Up House' are two of the best versions of these tunes ever recorded, and he excels on Charlie Parker's 'Barbados'.  Also worth mentioning is 'Blues In The Closet', unusual in the sense that Chet did not record many good interpretations of tunes based on blues changes.\n\nAlthough there is no singing here, Chet's unusually focused command and skilled playing make this album a must-have for fans of Chet's trumpet playing. If you are a traditional be-bop/hard bop fan who has never approached Chet Baker, give this album a try. ~ Michael Laprarie\n\nI've owned half a dozen Chet Baker CD's and half of them were poorly recorded or the performances were mediocre. This album, however, is absolutely awesome. I've owned it for a couple of years and it is all scratched up but I still listen to it often. Chet is in top form here and the sound quality as well as the musicianship has to be the best I've ever heard. The strength of material wanes a bit after track 5 but this is still remarkable stuff. There is no singing on this album for those of you looking for a vocal CD (try My Funny Valentine-it's great). His tone is so powerful on this CD and really pries at something inside -- a great recording and a fantastic CD. You can't go wrong here. ~ Bob Schlump\n\nPersonnel:\nChet Baker ( trumpet )\nBobby Jaspar ( flute, tenor sax )\nAmadeo Tommasi ( piano )\nRene Thomas ( guitar )\nDaniel Humair ( drums )\nBenoit Quersin ( bass )\n\nChet Baker - The Italian Sessions Tracks:\n01  We'll You Needn't ( 6:24 )\n02  These Foolish Things ( 4:59 )\n03  Barbados ( 8:30 )\n04  Star Eyes ( 7:01 )\n05  Over The Rainbow ( 3:31 )\n06  Pent-Up House ( 6:54 )\n07  Ballata In Forma Di Blues ( 10:06 )\n08  Blues In The Closet ( 7:43 )","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1486ce07dc43a2de648f1aed85dc8f0a62341b3e","amp;dn":"Chet+Baker+-+The+Italian+Sessions+%281962%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1486ce07dc43a2de648f1aed85dc8f0a62341b3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,134,206,7,220,67,162,222,100,143,26,237,133,220,143,10,98,52,27,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
