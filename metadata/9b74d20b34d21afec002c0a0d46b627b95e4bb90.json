Coulter states in the book that, in order to obtain the votes of African Americans, the Democratic Party has continually played the &quot;race card&quot; and accused the Republican Party of racism &quot;when it's not deserved&quot;. In relation to Barack Obama, Coulter said that he was only elected because of the idea that &quot;you're a racist if you don't vote for the first black president&quot; and that &quot;someone with his youth and lack of experience would not be elected if he was white.&quot;\n\nCoulter dedicates a section of the book to discussing the O.J. Simpson murder case and how, after his acquittal when African Americans were cheering for his release, it led to the shutdown of the &quot;white guilt bank&quot; related to white people feeling &quot;guilty for racial unfairness&quot;. She continued saying that &quot;everyone Ã¢â‚¬â€ blacks especially Ã¢â‚¬â€ are better off&quot; because of this and that, afterward, &quot;people werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t walking on eggshells, you could have then-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani enforcing sane criminal laws in New York and not caring that we was constantly being called a racist by liberals and Al Sharpton&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b74d20b34d21afec002c0a0d46b627b95e4bb90","amp;dn":"Mugged%3A+Racial+Demagoguery+Obama+-+Ann+Coulter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b74d20b34d21afec002c0a0d46b627b95e4bb90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,116,210,11,52,210,26,254,192,2,192,160,212,107,98,123,149,228,187,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
