All of his poetry was written as a teenager; he gave up creative writing completely before he turned 20.  He traveled extensively on three continents before his death from cancer just after his 37th birthday.\n\nAs part of the decadent movement, he profoundly influenced modern literature and arts, inspired a wide variety of musicians, and prefigured surrealism.  More than a century after his death, the young rebel-poet continues to appeal to modern readers as much for his turbulent life as for his poetry; his stormy affair with fellow poet Paul Verlaine and his nomadic adventures in eastern Africa are as iconic as his hallucinatory poems and symbolist prose.\n\n\nHere, in a variety of translations, are his complete works -- poetry, prose, and letters -- in a mix of PDF and ePUB formats:\n\n* A SEASON IN HELL &amp; ILLUMINATIONS (Modern Library, 2005).  Translated, edited and with an Introduction by Wyatt Mason. -- ePUB\n\n* COLLECTED POEMS (Oxford World's Classics, 2001).  Includes Parallel French text.
