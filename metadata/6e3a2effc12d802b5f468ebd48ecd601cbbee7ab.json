Starring Mexican actor DemiÃƒÂ¡n Bichir and German-American actress Diane Kruger, the series debuted on July 10, 2013.\n\n\nPremise:\n----------\nBased on the Danish/Swedish TV series of the same name, The Bridge follows two police detectives Ã¢â‚¬â€œ one Mexican, one American Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and their joint effort to investigate a serial killer menacing both nations along the TexasÃ¢â‚¬â€œChihuahua border. Their investigation is complicated by the rampant corruption and general apathy among the Mexican authorities and the violence of the powerful borderland drug cartels. The show title refers to the Bridge of the Americas that serves as a border crossing between El Paso, Texas and JuÃƒÂ¡rez, Chihuahua, where the series is set.\n\n\n\nCast: Diane Kruger\n      DemiÃƒÂ¡n Bichir\n      Annabeth Gish\n      Thomas M.
