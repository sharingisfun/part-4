Barnes suffered an injury during World War I which makes him unable to consummate a sexual relationship with Brett Ashley. The story follows Jake and his various companions across France and Spain. Initially, Jake seeks peace away from Brett by taking a fishing trip to Burguete, deep within the Spanish hills, with companion Bill Gorton, another veteran of the war. The fiesta in Pamplona is the setting for the eventual meeting of all the characters, who play out their various desires and anxieties, alongside a great deal of drinking.\n\n\nPlease seed 1:1\t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34943fc823e765be7b68bb9fd4fd36d443dc4d02","amp;dn":"Ernest+Hemingway+-+The+Sun+Also+Rises","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34943fc823e765be7b68bb9fd4fd36d443dc4d02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,148,63,200,35,231,101,190,123,104,187,159,212,253,54,212,67,220,77,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
