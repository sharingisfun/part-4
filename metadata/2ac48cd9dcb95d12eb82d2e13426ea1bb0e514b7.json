This bestselling reference gives you direct access to a complete range of full-color clinical images and patient radiographs that illustrate the differentiating characteristics of lesions in the oral and maxillofacial region. Significantly revised and updated content throughout this edition brings you the latest information on the etiology, clinical features, histopathology, treatment, and prognosis of each disease entity, as well as cutting-edge topics such as bisphosphonate osteonecrosis, the oral complications associated with methamphetamine abuse, solitary fibrous tumors, gene mutation, and plasminogen deficiency.\nOver 1,300 clinical photos and radiographs, most in full color, facilitate identification and classification of lesions.\nCurrent concepts of pathogenesis and disease management help you understand the diseases that affect the oral and maxillofacial structures, formulate an accurate diagnosis, and institute proper treatment.\nEach chapter is logically organized by body system or disease group, enabling you to easily identify a specific condition.\nA comprehensive appendix of differential diagnosis among oral and maxillofacial disease processes helps you rule out invalid diagnoses.\nThe bibliography divided by topic presented at the end of each chapter enables you to pursue supplemental literature.\nHighly accomplished authors and contributors with a broad range of clinical and classroom teaching experience provide well-balanced coverage of the entire subject.\nChapter outlines at the beginning of each chapter allow immediate access to specific topics.\nOver 200 new illustrations have been added to this popular, visual reference.\nA new section on bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis thoroughly explores and illustrates this recently identified complication resulting from medications used to prevent bone loss in patients with multiple myeloma, metastatic tumors, and osteoporosis.\nA new section about the oral complications of methamphetamine abuse details characteristic oral manifestations such as &quot;meth mouth cariesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and factitial injuries.\nExpanded coverage of oral piercings, intraoral tattoos, and other body modifications includes unusual entities such as tongue splitting and charm needles.\nA new section on transient lingual papillitis sheds light on this common cause of transitory tongue irritation.\nA new section on solitary fibrous tumors familiarizes you with this popular designation for certain benign fibrous neoplasms.\nA new section on hypoplasminogenemia (ligneous conjunctivitis), or plasminogen deficiency, includes images from a patient case that illustrate the characteristic gingival lesions associated with this rare but fascinating systemic condition.\nA new section on hereditary mucoepithelial dysplasia describes the characteristic oral manifestations that can lead you to accurately diagnose this condition, potentially preventing a woman with this disorder from having cytologically unusual cells misdiagnosed as carcinoma on her cervical PAP smears.\nA new section discusses the clinical and microscopic features of chronic ulcerative stomatitis, an immune-mediated condition of the oral mucosa that presents with erosive lesions and is often mistaken for lichen planus.\nThe chapter on Forensic Dentistry has been thoroughly revised and updated by leading forensic odontology author, Dr. Edward Herschaft, to include the latest information on this fascinating topic.\nSeveral chapters have been updated to include the most current knowledge of specific gene mutations associated with hereditary oral disorders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ac48cd9dcb95d12eb82d2e13426ea1bb0e514b7","amp;dn":"Oral+and+Maxillofacial+Pathology%2C+3E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ac48cd9dcb95d12eb82d2e13426ea1bb0e514b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,196,140,217,220,185,93,18,235,130,210,225,52,38,234,27,176,229,20,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
