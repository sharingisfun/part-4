And his sideline as an art thief keeps him busy when his job as a corporate headhunter gets dull.\n\nSTEAL.\n\nThen his wife introduces him to Clas Greve. Ambitious and talented, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the perfect candidate for a top job Roger needs to fill Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the priceless painting he owns makes him the perfect target for a heist.\n\nMURDER?\n\nBut soon Roger finds out that thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more to Greve than meets the eye, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not long before the hunter becomes the huntedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n---\n\nWith Headhunters, Jo NesbÃƒÂ¸ has crafted a funny, dark, and twisted caper story worthy of Quentin Tarantino and the Coen brothers.  Roger Brown is a corporate headhunter, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a master of his profession. But one career simply canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t support his luxurious lifestyle and his wifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fledgling art gallery. At an art opening one night he meets Clas Greve, who is not only the perfect candidate for a major CEO job, but also, perhaps, the answer to his financial woes: Greve just so happens to mention that he owns a priceless Peter Paul Rubens painting thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been lost since World War IIÃ¢â‚¬â€and Roger Brown just so happens to dabble in art theft. But when he breaks into GreveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s apartment, he finds more than just the painting. And Clas Greve may turn out to be the worst thing thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever happened to Roger Brown. \n\n\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1eddd87fbb1f5eda291b25d1aa95a43c6d6132bd","amp;dn":"Jo+Nesbo+-+Headhunters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1eddd87fbb1f5eda291b25d1aa95a43c6d6132bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,221,216,127,187,31,94,218,41,27,37,209,170,149,164,60,109,97,50,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
