Ã¢â‚¬Å“I stumbled across the guitar, because I needed something I could play that wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t in my mouth, and that I could write music on,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he laughs. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I was never going to get any girls playing clarinet. Not that I got any playing guitar, but it was a lot more fun.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nTaking a cue from the title of his latest album, Analog Man, Walsh criticizes the Ã¢â‚¬Å“digital recipeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of most pop music today, explaining, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all about the magic of a human performance.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAnd thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no better example of that than the interaction between Walsh and his host on the latest edition of Live from DarylÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s House, which turns HallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s living room into a garage, with a slam-bang version of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wrecking BallÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ ending in what Daryl dubs, Ã¢â‚¬Å“a Neil Young moment.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ There were more than several of those over the course of the episode.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a691708dfcf5b6fdc23d156164d94a35b4c1470a","amp;dn":"Daryl.Hall.Live.from.Daryl%27s.House.E60.Joe.Walsh.WEB-DL.%5BPSoul%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a691708dfcf5b6fdc23d156164d94a35b4c1470a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,145,112,141,252,245,182,253,194,61,21,97,100,217,74,53,180,193,71,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
