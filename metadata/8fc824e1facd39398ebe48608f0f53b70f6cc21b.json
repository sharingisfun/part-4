Grasshopper offers new ways to expand and control the 3D design and modeling processes, including automating repetitive processes; generating geometry through mathematical functions; quickly making changes to complex models; and creating complex forms through repetitions of simple geometry. Grasshopper requires no programming or scripting knowledge, but still allows designers a high degree of flexibility in creating both simple and complex forms. So join author Chris Reilly for this quick course, and get up and running with Grasshopper, fast.\nTopics include:\n\n    What is Grasshopper?\n    What's an algorithm?\n    Setting input data\n    Using data matching\n    Looking at mathematical and logical functions\n    Analyzing curves and surface data\n    Working with transformations\n    Manipulating the Data Tree","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fc824e1facd39398ebe48608f0f53b70f6cc21b","amp;dn":"Lynda-+Up+and+Running+with+Grasshopper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fc824e1facd39398ebe48608f0f53b70f6cc21b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,200,36,225,250,205,57,57,142,190,72,96,143,15,83,183,15,108,194,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
