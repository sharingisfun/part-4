R is a powerful open-source implementation of the statistical language S, which was developed by AT&amp;T. R has eclipsed S and the commercially-available S-Plus language, and has become the de facto standard for doing, teaching, and learning computational statistics.\n\nR is both an object-oriented language and a functional language that is easy to learn, easy to use, and completely free. A large community of dedicated R users and programmers provides an excellent source of R code, functions, and data sets. R is also becoming adopted into commercial tools such as Oracle Database. Your investment in learning R is sure to pay off in the long term as R continues to grow into the go to language for statistical exploration and research.\n\n- Covers the freely-available R language for statistics\n- Shows the use of R in specific uses case such as simulations, discrete probability solutions, one-way ANOVA analysis, and more\n- Takes a hands-on and example-based approach incorporating best practices with clear explanations of the statistics being done\n\nWhat youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn\n- Acquire and install R\n- Import and export data and scripts\n- Generate basic statistics and graphics\n- Program in R to write custom functions\n- Use R for interactive statistical explorations\n- Implement simulations and other advanced techniques\n\nWho this book is for\nBeginning R: An Introduction to Statistical Programming is an easy-to-read book that serves as an instruction manual and reference for working professionals, professors, and students who want to learn and use R for basic statistics. It is the perfect book for anyone needing a free, capable, and powerful tool for exploring statistics and automating their use.\n\nTable of Contents\nPart I: Learning the R Language\nChapter 1.
