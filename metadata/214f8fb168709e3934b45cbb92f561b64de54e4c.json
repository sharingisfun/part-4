Matagorda Bay (03:56)\n\nIf there was any question about Josh AbbottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intention as a Texas country artist, he answers it on Ã¢â‚¬ËœSmall Town Family Dream,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ his third studio album. Actually, he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just answer the question, he pulls a hot poker out of the fire and brands his love for the Lone Star state across his chest, back and arms. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no doubt where the Josh Abbbott Band frontmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s loyalty lies.\n\nHe also makes his disdain for Nashville clear. Ã¢â‚¬ËœIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Sing About MineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flagship song. Those who agree with his evaluation of Music City will likely enjoy what he has to say on the remaining 10 songs (11 if you get the bonus track). The singer gets personal when singing that Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tractors ainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sexyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ during his assault on country radio. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The radio is full of rich folks singing about places theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never seen,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he adds soon after.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœFlatland FarmerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ offers the same message with more artistry than Ã¢â‚¬ËœIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Sing About Mine.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ From there, songs like Ã¢â‚¬ËœDallas LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœMy TexasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (featuring Pat Green) pour cement over any ideas that Abbott is looking to go mainstream.\n\nVocally, Abbott is limited, but he makes the most of his talents with honest and urgent stories of small town America. A few songs that get overlooked amongst the Texas love letters are perhaps the best on the album (available now). Ã¢â‚¬ËœIdalou,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬ËœShe Will Be FreeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœRain Finally Coming DownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ come with sharp, imaginative lyrics that more than make up for pedestrian melodies. There are a few moments Ã¢â‚¬â€ specifically during the chorus of Ã¢â‚¬ËœHotty ToddyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€ where Abbott sounds like a young Garth Brooks. Whether or not this is a compliment to a singer focused on railing against Ã¢â‚¬Å“the establishmentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t clear, but it certainly should be.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:214f8fb168709e3934b45cbb92f561b64de54e4c","amp;dn":"Josh+Abbott+Band+-+Small+Town+Family+Dream+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"214f8fb168709e3934b45cbb92f561b64de54e4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,79,143,177,104,112,158,57,52,180,92,187,146,245,97,182,77,229,78,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
