This torrent was originally found via (ChingLiu) but he hasn't updated the versions so I'm gonna do it. He had version 310 and though that is great, a newer build came out. \n\nTo be honest, I did this because I was bored and plan on using this for my editing. \n\nNot looking to get a trusted skull green or pink, I just wanna help others.\n\nAlso if you are fascinated with learning Windows tech, check out FlippinWindows on YouTube and he has all sorts of tutorials on Windows and also customization ideas. I do not have any association with that person:\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks, joshfoun\n\nDesigned for complete creative control\nVegasÃ¢â€žÂ¢ Pro 13 is a contemporary NLE designed for complete creative control.
