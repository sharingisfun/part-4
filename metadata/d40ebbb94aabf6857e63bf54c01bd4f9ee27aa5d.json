Not long after they had formed, they released a split EP with Adelaide band I Killed The Prom Queen. Later that year, the band also made an appearance on the Byron Bay Hardcore compilation What WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Built, preceded by their debut EP, DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Close Your Eyes.\n\nIn May 2005 the PwD headed to the USA to record their debut album with renowned metal producer, Killswitch Engage guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz (who is responsible for acclaimed releases from the likes of Unearth, August Burns Red, Underoath and Johnny Truant.)\n\nSince the release of DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Close Your Eyes, Parkway Drive have rapidly accumulated a loyal fanbase Australia-wide, courtesy of support slots for international acts including Hatebreed, In Flames, Chimaira, Shadows Fall, As I Lay Dying, Bleeding Through, Alexisonfire, and performances at Metal for The Brain 2005 and AustraliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hardcore 2005. They have built quite a strong reputation within the music industry, this led to their signing with Epitaph record label.\nIn June 2006 they released Killing With a Smile in the United States during August of that year.\n01.
