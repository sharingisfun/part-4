She unravels the multi-generational blood, intermarriage, and protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ© relationships that have confined national influence to a privileged cluster of people. This unprecedented history of American power illuminates how financiers have retained their authoritative position through history, swaying presidents regardless of party affiliation. It explores the alarming global repercussions of a system lacking barriers between public office and private power. Prins leaves us with an ominous choice: either we break the alliances of the power elite, or they will break us.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08fa5a6e6c4a5ed6265902310cbebe48a328cb38","amp;dn":"All+the+Presidents%27+Bankers+-+Nomi+Prins+-+Audiobook+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08fa5a6e6c4a5ed6265902310cbebe48a328cb38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,250,90,110,108,74,94,214,38,89,2,49,12,190,190,72,163,40,203,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
