Whether it's medical marijuana (cannabis indica) or recreational marijuana (cannabis sativa), a grower needs clear information and helpful tips presented in a straightforward way. \n\nMedical marijuana must be free of contaminants, which could prove harmful to patients using it, and so it's usually grown indoors where the environment can be controlled. Temperature and humidity need to be carefully monitored, and the grower must watch out for and get rid of any insects, moulds, or fungi through the use of air filters and positive ventilation. Sound complicated? Not if you follow Jay Carter Brown's instructions. \n\nWith Growing Marijuana Indoors: A Foolproof Guide, growers will learn to breed a variety of plants that can be ingested easily or smoked with a minimum of coughing and which yield a soothing 'body high'.\n\nAuthor:\n\nJay Carter Brown is the author of Smuggler's Blues: The Saga of a Marijuana Importer. He lives in Vancouver, British Columbia.
