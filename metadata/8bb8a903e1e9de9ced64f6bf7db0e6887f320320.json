After learning the hands-on techniques to perform an effective and covert attack, specific routes to the target will be examined, including bypassing physical security. You will also get to grips with concepts such as social engineering, attacking wireless networks, web services, and remote access connections. Finally, you will focus on the most vulnerable part of the networkÃ¢â‚¬â€directly attacking the end user.\n\nThis book will provide all the practical knowledge needed to test your network's security using a proven hacker's methodology.\nApproach\n\nThis book provides an overview of the kill chain approach to penetration testing, and then focuses on using Kali Linux to provide examples of how this methodology is applied in the real world. After describing the underlying concepts, step-by-step examples are provided that use selected tools to demonstrate the techniques.\nWho this book is for\n\nIf you are an IT professional or a security consultant who wants to maximize the success of your network testing using some of the advanced features of Kali Linux, then this book is for you. This book will teach you how to become an expert in the pre-engagement, management, and documentation of penetration testing by building on your understanding of Kali Linux and wireless concepts.\n\n\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bb8a903e1e9de9ced64f6bf7db0e6887f320320","amp;dn":"Mastering+Kali+Linux+for+Advanced+Penetration+Testing+%5BPDF%5D+%5BSto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bb8a903e1e9de9ced64f6bf7db0e6887f320320","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,184,169,3,225,233,222,156,237,100,246,191,125,176,230,136,127,50,3,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
