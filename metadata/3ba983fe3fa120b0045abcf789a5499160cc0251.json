Their remarkable reign saw England emerge from the Dark Ages to become a highly organised kingdom that spanned a vast expanse of Europe. Plantagenet rule saw the establishment of laws and creation of artworks, monuments and tombs which survive to this day, and continue to speak of their sophistication, brutality and secrets.\n\nDan Jones brings you a new vision of this battle-scarred history. From the Crusades, to King JohnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s humbling over Magna Carta and the tragic reign of the last Plantagenet, Richard II Ã¢â‚¬â€œ this is a blow-by-blow account of EnglandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most thrilling age.\n\nAuthor:\n\nDan Jones took a first in History from Pembroke College, Cambridge in 2002. He is an award-winning journalist and a pioneer of the resurgence of interest in medieval history. His first book on the PeasantsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Revolt received widespread critical acclaim. This is his second book. He lives in London.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ba983fe3fa120b0045abcf789a5499160cc0251","amp;dn":"The+Plantagenets+-+The+Kings+Who+Made+England+By+Dan+Jones+%28Epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ba983fe3fa120b0045abcf789a5499160cc0251","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,169,131,254,63,161,32,176,4,90,188,247,137,165,73,145,96,204,2,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
