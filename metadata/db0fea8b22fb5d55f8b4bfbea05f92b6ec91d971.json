Lightfoot's songs are literate but down to earth, and deal with personal matters as well as global issues in a manner that's poetic yet accessible, and his rich, strong voice is a superb vehicle for his material, though his songs are versatile enough that many artists have enjoyed success with his tunes. \n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t97.42% CDDA% &amp; 99.77% CDDA &amp; 99.81% CDDA &amp; 94.76% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tRhino\nCatalogue:\t\tR2 75802\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.(Remember Me) I'm The One\n02.It's Too Late, He Wins\n03.For Lovin' Me\n04.Early Morning Rain\n05.The Way I Feel\n06.Steel Rail Blues\n07.A Message To The Wind\n08.Song For A Winter's Night\n09.Canadian Railroad Trilogy\n10.Go-Go Round\n11.Crossroads\n12.You'll Still Be Needing Me\n13.The Mountains And Maryann\n14.The Last Time I Saw Her\n15.Did She Mention My Name\n16.Pussywillows, Cat-Tails\n17.Boss Man\n18.Something Very Special\n19.Bitter Green\n20.Affair On 8th Avenue\n21.Medley: I'm Not Sayin'/Ribbon Of Darkness\n22.Softly\n23.Mama Said\n24.Station Master\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Sit Down Young Stranger\n02.If You Could Read My Mind\n03.Poor Little Allison\n04.The Pony Man\n05.Cobwebs &amp; Dust\n06.Too Much To Lose\n07.Summer Side Of Life\n08.Cotton Jenny\n09.10 Degrees &amp; Getting Colder\n10.Nous Vivons Ensemble\n11.Same Old Loverman\n12.Heaven Don't Deserve Me\n13.Don Quixote\n14.Alberta Bound\n15.Beautiful\n16.Ode To Big Blue\n17.Stone Cold Sober\n18.Old Dan's Records\n19.That Same Old Obsession\n20.Lazy Mornin'\n21.Hi'way Songs\n22.Can't Depend On Love\n\nDisc 3\n\n01.Sundown\n02.Carefree Highway\n03.Seven Island Suite\n04.Borderstone\n05.Cold On The Shoulder\n06.Now And Then\n07.Rainy Day People\n08.Fine As Fine Can Be\n09.All The Lovely Ladies\n10.Summertime Dream\n11.The Wreck Of The Edmund Fitzgerald\n12.Never Too Close\n13.Betty Called Me In\n14.Endless Wire\n15.The Circle Is Small\n16.Sea Of Tranquility\n17.Make Way For The Lady\n18.Dream Sweet Rose\n19.Ghosts Of Cape Horn\n20.Keepin' On Yearnin'\n21.Canary Yellow Canoe\n\nDisc 4\n\n01.Shadows\n02.She's Not The Same\n03.14 Karat Gold\n04.Baby Step Back\n05.In My Fashion\n06.Never Say Trust Me\n07.Why Should I Feel Blue\n08.Someone To Believe In\n09.Romance\n10.Broken Dreams\n11.Always On The Bright Side\n12.Forgive Me Lord\n13.Lifeline\n14.East Of Midnight\n15.Morning Glory\n16.A Lesson In Love\n17.A Passing Ship\n18.Waiting For You\n19.Drink Yer Glasses Empty\n20.I'll Prove My Love\n21.A Painter Passing Through\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db0fea8b22fb5d55f8b4bfbea05f92b6ec91d971","amp;dn":"Gordon+Lightfoot+-+Songbook+Box+Set+%281999%29+FLAC+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db0fea8b22fb5d55f8b4bfbea05f92b6ec91d971","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,15,234,139,34,251,93,85,248,180,191,190,160,95,146,182,236,145,217,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
