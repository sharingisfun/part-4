Starting with real business problems, see how concepts from functional programming can help you in Java. From function values Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹to streams, learn the significance of some of Java 8's additions - and get the same benefits in Java 6! This course teaches ways of thinking that help functional programmers write code that doesn't break. This course is designed for Java programmers, although any object-oriented developer can benefit from the very clear explanations of concepts. It assumes no familiarity with functional programming.\n\nAfter this course, you'll have more design options and ideas, and you'll find writing Java more fun than before.
