One may wonder who has the worst problems -- the neurotic, famous actress-mother, or her upcoming actress-daughter in rehab. Meryl showed already in this film that she really can sing on her own.\n\nBased on first novel by Carrie Fisher, depicting the life with her actress mother, Debbie Reynolds.\n\n'One of the best American screenplays of the last 50 years' - User comment on Imdb.\n\nOne of my favourites, could never find a torrent for it, so I picked up the DVD during a recent visit to the U.S.\n\n\nWidescreen, good stereo\nDVDrip. XviD Two-pass 704x384 AC3\nSource: NTSC IVTC\nBurn tested, runs well in my DivX player.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:defb0c9a7d7a0d6cdaaee161f9e961632054bb36","amp;dn":"Postcards+from+the+Edge+%281990%29+Streep%2BMacLaine+DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"defb0c9a7d7a0d6cdaaee161f9e961632054bb36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,251,12,154,125,122,13,108,218,174,225,97,249,233,97,99,32,84,187,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
