It's new release of 2008.\n\nWuthering Heights is a wild, passionate story of the intense and almost demonic love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, a foundling adopted by Catherine's father. \n\nAfter Mr Earnshaw's death, Heathcliff is bullied and humiliated by Catherine's brother Hindley and wrongly believing that his love for Catherine is not reciprocated, leaves Wuthering Heights, \n\nonly to return years later as a wealthy and polished man. He proceeds to exact a terrible revenge for his former miseries. The action of the story is chaotic and unremittingly violent, \n\nbut the accomplished handling of a complex structure, the evocative descriptions of the lonely moorland setting and the poetic grandeur of vision combine to make this unique novel a masterpiece of English literature.\n\nAuthor: Emily Bronte\nTitle: Wuthering Heights\nYear: 2008\nGenre: Classic\nRead By: Lisa Ray Campbell\n\nAudio: MP3, 192 kbit/s, 44.1 kHz, Stereo\nSize: 274 MB\nDuration: 6:23:15\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
