Describing himself as the most controversial speaker and author in the world, he has written 18 books explaining his position, dubbed New Age-conspiracism, and has attracted a substantial following across the political spectrum. His 533-page The Biggest Secret (1999) has been called the conspiracy theorist's Rosetta Stone.[1]\n\nIcke was a well-known BBC television sports presenter and spokesman for the Green Party, when he had an encounter in 1990 with a psychic who told him he was a healer who had been placed on Earth for a purpose. In April 1991 he announced on the BBC's Terry Wogan show that he was the son of God, and predicted that the world would soon be devastated by tidal waves and earthquakes. The show changed his life, turning him practically overnight from a respected household name into an object of public ridicule.\n\nHe continued nevertheless to develop his ideas, and in four books published over seven yearsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Robots' Rebellion (1994), And the Truth Shall Set You Free (1995), The Biggest Secret (1999), and Children of the Matrix (2001)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½set out a moral and political worldview that combines New-Age spiritualism with a passionate denunciation of what he sees as totalitarian trends in the modern world. At the heart of his theories lies the idea that a secret group of reptilian humanoids called the Babylonian Brotherhood controls humanity, and that many prominent figures are reptilian, including George W. Bush, Queen Elizabeth II, Kris Kristofferson, and Boxcar Willie.\n\nSome of Icke's theories have attracted the attention of the far right and the suspicion of Jewish groups. He has argued, for example, that the reptilians were the original authors of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a 1903 Russian forgery purporting to be a plan by the Jewish people to achieve world domination. Icke strongly denies there is anything antisemitic about this claim. He was allowed to enter Canada in 1999 only after persuading immigration officials thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as British journalist Jon Ronson put itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½when he said lizards, he meant lizards, but his books were still removed from the shelves of Indigo Books, a Canadian chain, after protests from the Canadian Jewish Congress. Icke's problems in Canada became the focus in 2001 of a documentary by Ronson, David Icke, the Lizards and the Jews.\n\nBooks Collection:\n\nDavid Icke - ...And The Truth Shall Set You Free\n\nDavid Icke - A Concise Description of the Illuminati\n\nDavid Icke - Aids - The Great Con Trick\n\nDavid Icke - Aids Agenda - Genocide\n\nDavid Icke - Alice in Wonderland and The World Trade Center\n\nDavid Icke - Alice In Wonderland And The Wtc Disaster\n\nDavid Icke - Are There Aliens Among Us\n\nDavid Icke - Attack\n\nDavid Icke - Barack Obama - The Naked Emperor\n\nDavid Icke - Bible Errors\n\nDavid Icke - Bloodlines of the Illuminati\n\nDavid Icke - Bush, Bin Laden, Illuminati\n\nDavid Icke - CANADA-A TOTALITARIAN STATE\n\nDavid Icke - Children of the Matrix\n\nDavid Icke - Claims Conspiracy At Highest Level\n\nDavid Icke - Credo Mutwa (Zulu Shaman) - Transcription\n\nDavid Icke - Exposing the Dream World We Believe to be Real\n\nDavid Icke - Federal Reserve System Fraud\n\nDavid Icke - Freemasons,Satanism and Symbolism\n\nDavid Icke - Hitler And The Rothschilds\n\nDavid Icke - Holocaust Industries\n\nDavid Icke - I Am Me I Am Free - The Robots' Guide To Freedom\n\nDavid Icke - Illuminati Mind Controled Slaves\n\nDavid Icke - Illuminati-The European Spider's Web\n\nDavid Icke - Infinite Love is the Only Truth, Everything Else is Illusion-Exposing The Dreamworld We Believe To be Real\n\nDavid Icke - Innocents Attacked\n\nDavid Icke - Lucid 666-Human Control System\n\nDavid Icke - Mapped Layout of the U.S. Media\n\nDavid Icke - Mind Controlled Celebrities\n\nDavid Icke - Mono-Atomic Gold A Secret Of Shapeshifting And The Reptilian Control\n\nDavid Icke - NASA Masonic Conspiracy Apollo Missions Masonic Symbols\n\nDavid Icke - Occultic Numerology\n\nDavid Icke - Origins of Christianity-Religious Frauds Archive\n\nDavid Icke - Predictions - Global Governance\n\nDavid Icke - Protocol Of The Of The Learned Elders Of Zion\n\nDavid Icke - Rare Book Of Scottish Rite Of Freemasonry Rituals-1st to 33rd Degrees\n\nDavid Icke - Reptilian Research Archives\n\nDavid Icke - Responds To Charges In Canada\n\nDavid Icke - Since When is The TRUTH Negative\n\nDavid Icke - Tales from the Time Loop\n\nDavid Icke - Tales Of A Government Sex Slave\n\nDavid Icke - The Biggest Secret\n\nDavid Icke - The Biggest Secret Companion Book Instructions How To Protect\n\nDavid Icke - The Book The Bushes Banned\n\nDavid Icke - The Gold of the Gods (Referenced in Revelations of A Mother Goddess)\n\nDavid Icke - The Hidden Codes In The Bible\n\nDavid Icke - The Hidden Gears Of Freemasonry\n\nDavid Icke - The European Spider's Web\n\nDavid Icke - The Illuminati Millennium Rituals\n\nDavid Icke - The Illuminati Rituals On The False Millenium And Coming Age Of Light\n\nDavid Icke - The New Mark Of The Beast-Part 1\n\nDavid Icke - The New Mark Of The Beast-Part 2\n\nDavid Icke - The New Mark Of The Beast-Part 3\n\nDavid Icke - The New Mark Of The Beast-Part 4\n\nDavid Icke - The New Mark Of The Beast-Part 5\n\nDavid Icke - The Reptilian Connection\n\nDavid Icke - The Robots' Rebellion - The Story of the Spiritual Renaissance\n\nDavid Icke - The Rothschild Dynasty\n\nDavid Icke - The Round Table Bilderburg Network\n\nDavid Icke - The Secret History Of America-The Greatest Conspiracy On Earth\n\nDavid Icke - The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.\n\nDavid Icke - The Windsor-Bush Bloodline\n\nDavid Icke - Turquoise\n\nDavid Icke - Was Hitler A Rothschild\n\nDavid Icke - Who Really Rules The World\n\nDavid Icke - WTC-Problem Reaction Solution\n\n\nPlease seed and share with others.
