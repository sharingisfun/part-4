Self-deception results when someone acts contrary to what they know is right. By ignoring that altruistic, internal voice, one triggers a chain of events that ultimately result in destructive behavior.\n\nThe &quot;disease&quot; of self-deception underlies all leadership problems in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s organizations. However well intentioned they may be, leaders who deceive themselves always end up undermining their own performance. This straightforward audio uses Tom Callum's story to demonstrate that while knowing how to avoid this problem is central to business relationships and success, awareness is equally important in one's personal relationships.\n\n\nBook Description\nPublication Date: January 5, 2010\n\nSince itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original publication nine years ago, Leadership and Self-Deception has become an international word-of-mouth phenomenon. Rather than tapering off, it has sold more copies each year since 2004 than it did in any of the first four years after publication. The bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s central insightÃ¢â‚¬â€that the key to leadership lays not in what we do, but in who we areÃ¢â‚¬â€has proved to have powerful resonances not only for organizational leadership, but in readersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ personal lives as well. Leadership and Self-Deception uses an entertaining story about an executive facing challenges at work and at home to expose the precise psychological processes that conceal our true motivations and intentions from us and trap us in a Ã¢â‚¬Å“boxÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of endless self-justification. Most importantly, the book shows us the way out.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4d610898ab4feca24f97d2bf39a22ff715156e1","amp;dn":"Leadership+And+Self-Deception%3A+Getting+Out+Of+The+Box","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4d610898ab4feca24f97d2bf39a22ff715156e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,214,16,137,138,180,254,202,36,249,125,43,243,154,34,255,113,81,86,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
