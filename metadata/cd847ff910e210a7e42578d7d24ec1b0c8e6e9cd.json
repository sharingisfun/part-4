Created by Terry Nation, a prolific television writer best known for creating the popular Dalek monsters for the television series Doctor Who, it ran for four series between 1978 and 1981. Popular from the time it was first broadcast, it remains well regarded on account of its dystopian tone, moral ambiguity and strong characterisation. It is also remembered for the dramatic ending that concluded the series.\n\nBlake's 7 follows the exploits of a group of political renegades, led by freedom fighter Roj Blake, and consisting initially of Blake, Jenna Stannis and Kerr Avon. They escape from a prison transport spacecraft and occupy an abandoned spacecraft called by them Liberator with a main computer called Zen. Vila Restal and Olag Gan are rescued from the prison planet Cygnus Alpha and are later joined by the alien telepath Cally. Later, a supercomputer called Orac is procured. Gan is killed during the second series. After the second series, Blake and Jenna disappear and are replaced by new characters Dayna Mellanby and Del Tarrant. In the fourth series, Cally dies and is replaced by a new character, Soolin. Following the destruction of the Liberator, the computer Zen is replaced with Slave, a new computer character, part of the newly acquired ship &quot;Scorpio&quot;. The group are pursued through space by Space Commander - and later renegade - Travis and Servalan, Supreme Commander and later President of the Terran Federation.\n\n\n\nBlake's 7 - The Making Of The Audio Series @ 25 mim\n\nBlake's 7 - The Sevenfold Crown @ 90 min\nBlake's 7 - The Syndeton Experiment @ 60 mim\n\nBlake's 7 - S01 - E01 - Rebel @ 60 mim\nBlake's 7 - S01 - E02 - Traitor @ 60 mim\nBlake's 7 - S01 - E03 - Liberator @ 60 mim\n\nBlake's 7 - The Early Years - S01 - E01 - Eye Of The Machine @ 30 mim\nBlake's 7 - The Early Years - S01 - E02 - Blood &amp; Earth @ 30 mim\nBlake's 7 - The Early Years - S01 - E03 - The Dust Run @ 30 mim\nBlake's 7 - The Early Years - S01 - E04 - The Trial @ 30 mim\nBlake's 7 - The Early Years - S01 - E05 - When Villa Met Gan @ 30 mim\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 25 to 90mn \nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd847ff910e210a7e42578d7d24ec1b0c8e6e9cd","amp;dn":"Blake%5C%27s+7+-+Audio+Sci-fi+Drama+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd847ff910e210a7e42578d7d24ec1b0c8e6e9cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,132,127,249,16,226,16,167,228,37,120,215,210,78,193,176,200,230,233,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
