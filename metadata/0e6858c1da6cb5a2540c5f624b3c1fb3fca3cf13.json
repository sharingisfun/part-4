Part of the US Cities series. Tested and working.\n\nBuy if you like it, it will allow you do download updates that increase fps, fix bugs, add stuff etc etc. It will also keep the developers in business. Trust me the updates are crucial for a smooth fsx experience.\n\nWord on performance, this isnt a heavy hitter like manhattan but a tip for any aerosoft product; in the scenery folder of the add on, change the extension of anything that has the word sounds, traffic or birds or simillar stuff to .off from .bgl. This will give a nice boost in certain setups. also use the AESlite tool to disable traffic and animations on the airports. Doing this i have an unchanged Amsterdam airport running lightning fast on an AMD 980. Same results on manhattan x, running that at 30+ all sliders to the right with fsdt jfk and all other addon imagineable.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e6858c1da6cb5a2540c5f624b3c1fb3fca3cf13","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%5D+Aerosoft+US+Cities+Los+Angeles+X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e6858c1da6cb5a2540c5f624b3c1fb3fca3cf13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,104,88,193,218,108,181,162,84,12,95,98,75,60,31,179,252,163,207,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
