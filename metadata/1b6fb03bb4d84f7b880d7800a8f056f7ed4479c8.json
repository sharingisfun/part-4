But what if you could take these and other meal favorites to the next level with an amazing, healthy marinade, rub or topping? Nothing beats salads or steamed veggies for healthful eating, but why not make them more tempting--and even more nutritious--with a delicious dressing that's loaded with antioxidants and healthful fats? And berries make a satisfying dessert, for sure, but the right topping can make it a decadent dessert.\n\n\n Sometimes all it takes to transform basic natural foods into a quick culinary masterpiece is a little added a rub, a sauce, a marinade, or a dressing. The problem is, most traditional sauces, glazes, and dressings that add zip and zest also tend to add sugar, trans fats, gluten, MSG, and other damaging ingredients.\n\nFollowing the remarkable worldwide success of The Primal Blueprint, best-selling author Mark Sisson and chef Jennifer Meier now present the solution to these problems: Primal Blueprint: Healthy Sauces, Dressings and Toppings. Based on the scientifically proven eating strategy that has enabled millions to burn off body fat, lose weight, boost energy, and become abundantly healthy, Healthy Sauces, Dressings and Toppings offers easy-to-prepare recipes and an almost infinite number of uses. Bring incredible flavor to basic good food while adding the important healthful benefits, including Omega-3 fats, powerful antioxidants, and countless other important nutrients lacking in most plain meals. Why suffer with bland food? Why not savor living your healthy life to the fullest!\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UsO1WdgFL._SL500_PIsitb-sticker-arrow-big,TopRight,35,-73_OU01_SS500_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UsO1WdgFL._SL500_PIsitb-sticker-arrow-big,TopRight,35,-73_OU01_SS500_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe Primal Blueprint 21-Day Total Body Transformation: A step-by-step, gene reprogramming action plan \n\n\nPublisher: Primal Nutrition, Inc \nMark Sisson\n2011 \nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0982207778\nISBN-13: 978-0982207772 \n192 pages\nEPUB  \n2.91 MB \n\nPrimal Blueprint author Mark Sisson presents a fun, easy-to-follow, practical guidebook to help you &quot;get Primal&quot; in only 21 days.
