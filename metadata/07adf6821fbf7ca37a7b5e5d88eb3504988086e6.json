Strum GS-2 embeds an elaborate \n   chord  recognition and  voicing module  which automatically  voices chords \n   played on the keyboard as a guitar player would on the fretboard. Strumming \n   and picking  swings into  action with  an auto-strum  function and  special \n   strumming keys. Elaborate rhythm figures available from a large  collection \n   of MIDI loops are on hand to supplement chord progressions. Strum GS-2 is a \n   complete redesign  of its  predecessor. In  addition to  the synthesis  and \n   strumming engines  which have  been completely  reviewed, Strum  GS-2 ships \n   with a new streamlined interface, a new equalizer and compressor module,  a \n   new multi-effect processor, brings native 64-bit operation on Mac OS X  and \n   Windows, and much more. Strum GS-2 also features an all-new factory library \n   comprising a number of nylon  and steel acoustic guitars of  various sizes, \n   both in natural and production-ready configurations. \n             \n   &quot;We have completely reviewed the  modeling behind Strum-from the string  to \n   the body-and  reconsidered how  the different  elements interact  with each \n   other; we have also re-examined how strumming is performed, now giving us a \n   whole new  level of  realism, tone  control, and  expressivity, &quot; said Marc \n   -Pierre Verge, CEO  of AAS. &quot;With  its extensive collection  of guitars and \n   the ability to tweak  them as required, Strum  GS-2 is an even  more clever \n   solution  than ever  for creating  great-sounding acoustic  guitar tracks. \n   Playing guitar on a keyboard has never been easier.&quot;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo not make money with this software...\n\nRemember to BUY the stuff if you USE it.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndemonoid.pw\n1337x.to\nthepiratebay.se\nflashtorrents.org\nbtscene.cc\ncastradio.net\nbtdigg.org\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXV (05)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07adf6821fbf7ca37a7b5e5d88eb3504988086e6","amp;dn":"AAS+-+Strum+GS-2+v2.0.0.OS+X+%5BAiR%5D%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07adf6821fbf7ca37a7b5e5d88eb3504988086e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,173,246,130,31,191,124,163,122,123,94,93,136,235,53,4,152,128,134,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
