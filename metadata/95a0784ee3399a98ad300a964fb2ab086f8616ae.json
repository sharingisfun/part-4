A new cast featuring Ken Stott as DI Rebus was introduced in the second series (which went into production in 2005, made in-house by STV).\n\nMain characters:\n\nDetective Inspector John Rebus - Ken Stott \nDetective Chief Inspector Gill Templer - Jennifer Black \nDetective Sergeant Siobhan Clarke - Claire Price\n\nSeason 2 \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSeason 2, Episode 1: The Falls\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½2 January 2006\n \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSeason 2, Episode 2: Fleshmarket Close\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½16 January 2006\nA man from Kosovo is killed in a seedy Edinburgh slum. Considered by some to be a hate crime, due largely to the racist slur painted on the victim's head -- Rebus is unconvinced. Clues lead to the dirty underworld of gangland bosses, and their control over the local underprivileged. Fingerprints, blood stains, odd looks, dramatic music cues -- even unused tickets to a soccer match -- all lead Rebus to another corpse. Rebus sees the killer's motivation not as racist, but rather of sibling rivalry, hidden passion, or something much more devious... Or maybe not. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95a0784ee3399a98ad300a964fb2ab086f8616ae","amp;dn":"Rebus+Season+Two+-+Ken+Stott","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95a0784ee3399a98ad300a964fb2ab086f8616ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,160,120,78,227,57,154,152,173,48,10,150,79,178,171,8,111,134,22,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
