The movie starts with Cesar (Collins Jr.) being released from the St. Louis Cardinals and moving back to Mexico. A group of rag tag kids (Moises Arias, Jake T. Austin, Ryan Ochoa) who love baseball recruit him to be their coach. When they are finally approved to get a official little league team their journey begins. Together, they beat the odds and overcome hardships and bigotry to compete in the 1957 Little League World Series.\n\nThe movie chronicles the formation of a misfit Little League team in Monterrey Mexico. In 1957, this motley crew crossed the border, challenged much larger and more experienced teams, and ascended to the Little League World Series. It was the first time an International team qualified for the World Series and the only time in history a perfect game was pitched during this competition. \n\nRuntime: 118 mins\nLanguage: English\nYear: 2009\nQuality: 9/10\nFormat: avi format \n\nSee reviews here,  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Perfect-Game-Clifton-Collins/dp/B004X2TYG2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Perfect-Game-Clifton-Collins/dp/B004X2TYG2&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI would ask every Christian to do 2 things.\n\n1. If possible please buy this movie. Do you know that there are 2.2 billion Christians on earth today. But only a privileged few, around 12% have the means and the accessibility to buy Christian films. Many Christians are too poor to buy movies or live in places where Christian films are not available. \nThat's not all. Out of the 12% who have the means and accessibility to buy Christian media, only around 0.5% ever buys a Christian movie. In other words only 1 out of 200 Christians ever buys a Christian movie. Pathetic isn't it?\nPlease buy the movies to keep Christian films in business. And please do pray for the Christian movie makers and their families.\n\n2. Please seed the movies for as long as possible. If possible make copies and distribute to your poor neighbors. And please do pray for the movie makers and their families. Remember the Kingdom of Heaven is in you and so is the choice of Heaven/Hell. \n\nPS: If you need any specific Christian movie or have something to say then kindly send a mail to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;ee87808a878f808d869c879d9a878f80dcdeded7ae978f868181c08d81c08780&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nKindly mention the subject as Christian Movies or something similar. \n\n&quot;Don't ask me what Christ can do for you! He has done all he could. Tell me what you can do for Christ?&quot;\n\nUploaded by Indian Christian\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1261f3cfbfef15d6a7e4cf99ce6d57ff1883bb90","amp;dn":"The+Perfect+Game+%28Christian+Movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1261f3cfbfef15d6a7e4cf99ce6d57ff1883bb90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,97,243,207,191,239,21,214,167,228,207,153,206,109,87,255,24,131,187,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
