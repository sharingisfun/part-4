After getting involved in school plays, the young and promising artist had the opportunity to join Daniel Jones in an outfit originally called Crush. They formed Savage Garden in 1997 in their native Brisbane, Australia. Hayes ended his marriage and decided to settle in the U.S. while Daniel Jones stayed in Australia before releasing their second and last album, called Affirmation. Savage Garden split up in 2001, leaving behind three successful years including the honor of becoming a leading number in the annual Most Broadcast Artists List issued by the Phonographic Performance Company of Australia (PPCA) for two years. Hayes debuted as a solo artist with the release of Spin, recorded in San Francisco, CA, and co-produced with Grammy Award-winning Walter Afanasieff. The 12-track record featured the hit single &quot;Insatiable,&quot; a chart-topping song in Australia and one of the most added tracks on the American Top 40 radio stations soon after its release. Since that time, Hayes has released several recordings including Too Close for Comfort in 2003, Tension and the Spark in 2004, and This Delicate Thing We've Made in 2007.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Strange Relationship\n02.Insatiable\n03.Heart Attack\n04.I Miss You\n05.Creepin' Up On You\n06.Dirty\n07.Crush (1980 ME)\n08.Good Enough\n09.I Can't Ever Get Enough Of You\n10.Like It Or Not\n11.What You Like\n12.Spin\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:176ff7dd5710a121a5c48cc1267830ef611695b5","amp;dn":"Darren+Hayes+-+Spin+%282002%29+%5BCD+Rip%5D+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"176ff7dd5710a121a5c48cc1267830ef611695b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,111,247,221,87,16,161,33,165,196,140,193,38,120,48,239,97,22,149,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
