Eating honey can help lower the risk of heart disease, cancer , diabetes--even help reduce body fat and unwanted weight!--and increase longevity.\n\nPure, raw, unprocessed honey is a healthier sweetener than table sugar and high fructose corn syrup. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chock-full of antioxidants, minerals, and vitamins--and only has 21 calories per teaspoon.\n\nSuper Ã¢â‚¬Å“bee foodsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (including nutrient-rich bee pollen, propolis, and royal jelly) are used and touted for their healing powers by beekeepers and medical experts in the present-day.\n\nHoney can relieve a variety of ailments, including allergies, coughs, fatigue, pain, and stress, as well as boost libido.\n\nThe honey bee pollinates about one-third of the food we consume (including nutritious fruits and nuts).\n\nDrawing on the latest honey buzz and interviews with medical doctors, beekeepers, and researchers, this charming and enlightening book (sweetened with stories about honey bees and humans) reveals 30 healing honey varieties paired with cinnamon and teas, tells you how to incorporate honey into Mediterranean-style, heart-healthy recipes like Honey Custard French Toast, Honey-Glazed Game Hen, and Filo Pear and Honey Tarts, and provides more than 50 home cures that combat digestive woes to skin woes. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also enjoy CleopatraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s milk-and-honey beauty treatments and eco-friendly beeswax household uses--all made with the amazing honey beeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gifts!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A fascinating read about a natural remedy that is a rich source of antioxidants.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ --Ray Sahelian, M.D., author of Mind Boosters\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This eye-opening book provides you with a delicious truth of the traditional Mediterranean diet: Honey is a sumptuous route to optimal health.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ --Dr. Will Clower, Ph.D., author of The French DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Diet Plan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2731bc730bc41320a11630c8fa84c343c5f697d6","amp;dn":"The.Healing.Powers.of.Honey.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2731bc730bc41320a11630c8fa84c343c5f697d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,49,188,115,11,196,19,32,161,22,48,200,250,132,195,67,197,246,151,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
