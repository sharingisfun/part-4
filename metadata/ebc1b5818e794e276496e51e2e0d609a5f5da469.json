WHAT IF the watershed moment you could change was the JFK assassination? 11.22.63, the date that Kennedy was shot - unless . . .\n\nKing takes his protagonist Jake Epping, a high school English teacher from Lisbon Falls, Maine, 2011, on a fascinating journey back to 1958 - from a world of mobile phones and iPods to a new world of Elvis and JFK, of Plymouth Fury cars and Lindy Hopping, of a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald and a beautiful high school librarian named Sadie Dunhill, who becomes the love of Jake's life - a life that transgresses all the normal rules of time.\n\nWith extraordinary imaginative power, King weaves the social, political and popular culture of his baby-boom American generation into a devastating exercise in escalating suspense. \n\nOn November 22, 1963, three shots rang out in Dallas, President Kennedy died, and the world changed. What if you could change it back? Stephen KingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s heart-stoppingly dramatic new novel is about a man who travels back in time to prevent the JFK assassinationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a thousand page tour de force.\n\nFollowing his massively successful novel Under the Dome, King sweeps readers back in time to another momentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a real life momentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½when everything went wrong: the JFK assassination. And he introduces readers to a character who has the power to change the course of history.\n\nJake Epping is a thirty-five-year-old high school English teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine, who makes extra money teaching adults in the GED program. He receives an essay from one of the studentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a gruesome, harrowing first person story about the night 50 years ago when Harry DunningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s father came home and killed his mother, his sister, and his brother with a hammer. Harry escaped with a smashed leg, as evidenced by his crooked walk.\n\nNot much later, JakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s friend Al, who runs the local diner, divulges a secret: his storeroom is a portal to 1958. He enlists Jake on an insaneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and insanely possibleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½mission to try to prevent the Kennedy assassination. So begins JakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new life as George Amberson and his new world of Elvis and JFK, of big American cars and sock hops, of a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald and a beautiful high school librarian named Sadie Dunhill, who becomes the love of JakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a life that transgresses all the normal rules of time.\n\nA tribute to a simpler era and a devastating exercise in escalating suspense, 11/22/63 is Stephen King at his epic best.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebc1b5818e794e276496e51e2e0d609a5f5da469","amp;dn":"Stephen+King+-+11.22.63%3A+A+Novel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebc1b5818e794e276496e51e2e0d609a5f5da469","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,193,181,129,142,121,78,39,100,150,229,30,46,13,96,154,95,93,164,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
