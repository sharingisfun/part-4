Craig Gisto, head of the latest branch of Private, is enjoying the glamorous launch party with his new team when their celebrations are interrupted by the bloodied arrival of a boy with his eyes gouged out. The boy is the kidnapped son of one of Australia's richest men but investigating his death isn't their only pressing case. The rock star Micky Stevens is convinced someone's trying to kill him, and believes Private are the only ones who can help. As if that wasn't enough, someone is murdering the wealthy wives of the Eastern Suburbs, in the most brutal way imaginable. And if they don't catch the killer soon, the next victim could be someone close to Private.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6f996436ce2cf2efed25e1365ed73fab784582e","amp;dn":"Private+Down+Under+by+James+Patterson+Epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6f996436ce2cf2efed25e1365ed73fab784582e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,249,150,67,108,226,207,46,254,210,94,19,101,237,115,250,183,132,88,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
