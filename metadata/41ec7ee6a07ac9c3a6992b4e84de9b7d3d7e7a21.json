A common attitude is that obese people should be ashamed - it is their fault, they have no will power and if they could just 'eat less and exercise more', the problem would soon be solved. Yet, despite millions of pounds being spent on this simple message, the UK is getting fatter every year.\r\nCambridge geneticist Dr Giles Yeo believes that for many obese people, simply eating less is a lot harder than you might think - and he is taking a road trip around the UK and America to uncover why. He meets the real people behind some of the more shocking newspaper headlines and, through their stories, reveals surprising truths which dispel commonly held myths about obesity. He gains access to scientists and doctors trialling cutting-edge techniques to tackle the crisis - from a 'miracle' hormone injection to a transfusion of faecal matter, and even learns a thing or two about his own size and relationship with food.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/82/Why-are-We-Getting-So-Fat-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/53/Why-are-We-Getting-So-Fat-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/89/Why-are-We-Getting-So-Fat-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f5/Why-are-We-Getting-So-Fat-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/60/Why-are-We-Getting-So-Fat-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/08/Why-are-We-Getting-So-Fat-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/40/Why-are-We-Getting-So-Fat-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e6/Why-are-We-Getting-So-Fat-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/91/Why-are-We-Getting-So-Fat-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CALVC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: 1208 Kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 832 x 468\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\r\nAudio: English\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 59 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 562 MB\r\nContainer: MP4\r\nSource: PDTV\r\nEncoded by: Harry65\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English subtitles\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07fys2y\r\n\r\n2)  Related Documentaries \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Why%20are%20Thin%20People%20not%20Fat","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41ec7ee6a07ac9c3a6992b4e84de9b7d3d7e7a21","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon+2016+Why+Are+We+Getting+So+Fat+PDTV+x264+AAC+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41ec7ee6a07ac9c3a6992b4e84de9b7d3d7e7a21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,236,126,230,160,122,201,195,166,153,43,78,132,222,155,125,61,126,122,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
