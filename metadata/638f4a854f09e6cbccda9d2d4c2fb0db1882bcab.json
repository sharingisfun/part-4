Produced by Alan Moulder, Ritual is the perfect epic and roaring follow up taking us on a sonic journey through dancefloor beats meets raging guitars and everything in between, fused together perfectly, and all at an incredibly melodic breakneck speed. Ritual teems with dark distorted anthems for the modern age. British critics have given White Lies accolades as successors to the likes of Echo &amp; The Bunnymen, The Teardrop Explodes, Depeche Mode, The Psychedelic Furs and Magazine and have called lyricist Charles Cave a &quot; classic doom-rock dreamweaver; Nick Cave meeting Edgar Allen Poe.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:638f4a854f09e6cbccda9d2d4c2fb0db1882bcab","amp;dn":"White+Lies+-+Ritual+%5Bmp3-vbr-2011%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"638f4a854f09e6cbccda9d2d4c2fb0db1882bcab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,143,74,133,79,9,230,203,204,218,157,45,76,47,176,219,24,130,188,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
