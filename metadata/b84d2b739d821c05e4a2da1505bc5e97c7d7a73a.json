From the creator of THE AUTHORITY and PLANETARY comes the craziest and most horrifying superhero comic you've ever read! In the world of SUPERGOD, superhumans are the ultimate expression of the Messiah complex, and scientists can build Messiahs who will fly down from the skies to save the world. No-one thought about how they'd do it -- or even if they'd want to. So begins the apocalyptic tomorrow of SUPERGOD -- the story of how supermen killed us all and ended the world just because we wanted to be rescued by human-shaped things from beyond Science itself! Take every superhero comic ever published, shove them into a nuclear-powered blender, soak it in bad vodka and set the whole thing alight -- and SUPERGOD will crawl out and eat your brain! This five issue color series is drawn by Garrie Gastony with colors by Digikore. SUPERGOD is available with a Regular cover painted by Felipe Massafera, a Wraparound by series artist Garrie Gastony, and a special retailer incentive Church Of Supergod Edition!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b84d2b739d821c05e4a2da1505bc5e97c7d7a73a","amp;dn":"Warren+Ellis%27+Supergod+%2801+-++05%29+%282010%29+%28digital%29+%28Minutemen-Ph","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b84d2b739d821c05e4a2da1505bc5e97c7d7a73a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,77,43,115,157,130,28,5,228,162,218,21,5,188,94,151,199,215,167,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
