These trains were a vital cog in the military machine from carrying troops, to moving hospitals, to being transformed into actual weapons. In this compelling series we tell the stories of these incredible trains...\r\nWe combine expert interviews, authentic reconstruction, engineering graphics and archive, highlighting the extraordinary human stories alongside the engineering detail and military perspective. The stories are dramatic, exciting and filled with fascinating historical detail. Each of these incredible stories is set against a backdrop of conflict and we put the events into context. In addition to the stories of the trains we learn more about the military, political and domestic battles happening at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8)  World War Two \r\nBetween 1939 and 1945 war came to Britain's railways. By now an established technology, in the Second World War trains operating in Britain came into their own - bringing troops back home after the humiliation of Dunkirk, as well as taking hundreds of thousands of city children to safety. The programme interviews eye-witnesses to both railway adventures, and discovers the disused Tube station where the evacuations were coordinated. There are tales of the heroism of the railway staff during the Blitz, and how a small siding in a Hampshire railway station played its part in the preparations for D-Day.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/36/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/99/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f6/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b8/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3c/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/28/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/82/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4f/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2d/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6c/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ea/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/38/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/56/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8b/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/35/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4f/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 1666 Kbps\r\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 468\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 45 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 8\r\n * Part Size: 518 MB\r\n * Source: PDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.historychannel.com.au/tv-shows/1918/combat-trains-the-death-railway","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b43d0f4ebebe218f9ba0a9925a714fbb44236f3","amp;dn":"Combat+Trains+8of8+World+War+Two+PDTV+x264+AAC+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b43d0f4ebebe218f9ba0a9925a714fbb44236f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,67,208,244,235,235,226,24,249,186,10,153,37,167,20,251,180,66,54,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
