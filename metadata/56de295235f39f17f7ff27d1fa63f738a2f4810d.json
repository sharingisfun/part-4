The year is 1942. On \n\nthe majestic terraces of the ominous fortress of Berchtesgaden, perched above the Bavarian Alps, a woman prances in the \n\nnude, waving randomly at the spying telescopes. This is the restless Eva (Elena Rufanova), who is waiting for her beloved \n\n&quot;Adi,&quot; the Fuhrer (eonid Mosgovoi), who arrives with a thunder and bolt. In his entourage are his right-hand man Martin \n\nBormann and his propaganda specialist Joseph Goebbels with his loving wife, Magda. The scene is set for a peaceful retreat \n\nof several hours. However, an uncontrollable war is raging in the heart of Eva, who is caught in the complexities of a man \n\nincapable of intimacy. Rather than a historical treatise, the film is a psychological study of the man who was the terror of \n\nthe twentieth century and the person who was the closest to him. The clue to how it all happened seems to be hidden in \n\nsome of the intimate moments between the two characters. Sokurov is dealing with a very sensitive subject in a film which \n\nis a complex reflection on power. Each frame carries the mark of his previous nine films and is a testimony to his meticulous \n\nart. Moloch is a very powerful film that gives the impression that time is suspended. Particularly for this reason, it is not \n\nrecommended to those who like their cinema fast paced and light-hearted. Sokurov used Russian theater actors from St. \n\nPetersburg to shoot the film, but their voices were later dubbed by theater actors from Berlin. The film received the Best \n\nScreenplay award of the 52nd Cannes Film Festival, 1999.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Moloch - 1999 - Alexander Sokurov.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 47mn\n      Bit rate : 1811 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 13.0 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : No\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Custom\n      PlayTime : 1h 47mn\n      Bit rate : 1623 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 384 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 1.667\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.274\n      StreamSize : 1.22 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 47mn\n      Bit rate : 180 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 138 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.97 \n      Encoding settings : ABR\n\nGerman audio, English subtitle\n\nIMDB: D:BT DownloadsMoloch - 1999 - Alexander SokurovMoloch - 1999 - Alexander Sokurov.avi\n   General\n      Complete name : D:BT DownloadsMoloch - 1999 - Alexander SokurovMoloch - 1999 - Alexander Sokurov.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 47mn\n      Bit rate : 1811 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 13.0 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : No\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Custom\n      PlayTime : 1h 47mn\n      Bit rate : 1623 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 384 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 1.667\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.274\n      StreamSize : 1.22 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 47mn\n      Bit rate : 180 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 138 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.97 \n      Encoding settings : ABR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56de295235f39f17f7ff27d1fa63f738a2f4810d","amp;dn":"Moloch+-+1999+-+Alexander+Sokurov","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56de295235f39f17f7ff27d1fa63f738a2f4810d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,222,41,82,53,243,159,23,247,255,39,209,250,99,247,56,162,244,129,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
