But the city survives, and Simone Pierce is one of its best private investigators. Her latest case, running surveillance on a potentially unfaithful husband, was supposed to be easy. Then her target is murdered, and the search for his killer points Simone towards a secret from the past that canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t possibly be realÃ¢â‚¬â€but that wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most powerful men and women from trying to acquire it for themselves, with Simone caught in the middle.\n\n&quot;Heinlein meets Hammett in this whip-smart whodunnit set amid the billowing fog and rising waters of a future New York in which the truth, like the monuments and skyscrapers of the city's past, seems always to lie just below the surface.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Chuck Greaves, award-winning author of Hush Money, Green-Eyed Lady, and The Last Heir.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I have long admired Lev RosenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strange, genre-bending work, and Depth is an exciting display of his many gifts. His vision of postÃ¢â‚¬â€œglobal warming Manhattan is richly imagined and noir-ishly melancholy, and his riff on the traditional detective story is elegant, surprising, and, yes, deep.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Dan Chaon, author of Await Your Reply and Stay Awake","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c940873737b7889358909dbb2ac9c4ef32e8da61","amp;dn":"Lev+A.C.+Rosen+-+Depth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c940873737b7889358909dbb2ac9c4ef32e8da61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,64,135,55,55,183,136,147,88,144,157,187,42,201,196,239,50,232,218,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
