The Light Properties control allows the user to toggle specific lights to preview in the scene, with accumulated brightness for each selected light. MIP Map support improves performance when previewing large textures. Our OpenGL hardware improvements preview textures more efficiently, with reliable onscreen display of lights, shadows, and color, for smarter interactive scene creation.[/b]\n\n\nSubSurface Scattering\n\nSkin, wax, and marble are just some of the materials that are translucent when struck by light. To recreate this subtle yet crucial effect when rendering these materials in Poser, we've incorporated a set of easy to configure SubSurface Scattering Material Nodes. New Nodes include SubSurface Skin, Fast Scatter, and basic Scatter. The Scatter Node includes a number of optimized pre-sets for Skin, Marble, Milk, Fruit and Vegetables. With Poser's new SubSurface Materials, you'll transform your scenes into rendered masterpieces with lifelike translucent surfaces.\n\n\nRendering Performance Improvements\n\nPoser's FireFly Rendering Engine keeps getting better with numerous improvements in reflections, transparencies, depth of field and motion blur quality, netting visibly smoother results without significantly impacting render times. We've invested time in Indirect Lighting (IDL) which now supports Ambient Occlusion (AO) with faster transparency rendering. We've also enabled Light Casting Objects to be invisible in final renderings yet still contribute illumination to the scene. In addition to our new SubSurface Scattering Nodes, we've included a new Custom Scatter Node to support effects such as bioluminescent skin.\n\n\nWeight Map Rigging\n\nHigh-end professional 3D applications like Max and Maya have set the standard for Weight Map Rigging, and now both Poser and Poser Pro provide the most open vertex Weight Mapping support available to Poser users today. Weight Map Rigging offers several benefits including smoother bending folds and bulges with vertex by vertex control over every bend or bulge. Weight Maps can be added to any joint bend, to twist and scaling channels and can be used to control bulges. Plus Poser takes the standard of Weight Map Rigging several steps further with support for Hybrid Joint Rigging (combining traditional Poser Sphere/Capsule Zones with Weight Maps), using either single mesh geometry or traditionally grouped geometry, and enables Weight Maps or zones to affect any number of body parts beyond the current joint. Poser's new Weight Map Rigging provides a platform that will support third party figures that use Weight Mapping, by expanding the open, well documented and easily editable Poser PZ3 file format, to encourage creativity and user driven enhancements to Poser figures.\n\n\nExpanded Context Menus\n\nSometimes, it's the simple things that make the biggest difference. Poser's expanded Context Menus will vastly improve interaction and scene creation, and change the way you work with Poser forever. Six unique Context Menus have been developed for Figures, Actors, Objects, Lights, Cameras and Backgrounds to provide quick access to the most useful menu operations including selecting, toggling IK on/off, copying symmetry in poses, pointing lights, conforming clothing, setting parenting, changing light types, and even hiding/revealing all items in a Grouping Object. Once you start using Poser's new Context Menus, you'll enjoy working and playing with Poser all over again.\nweightmap riggingsubsurface scattering Poser\n\n\nGrouping Objects\n\nNeed a way to move, scale or hide a bunch of objects in a Poser scene, at the same time? Now you can simply add any number of scene elements, from figures and props to lights, into a Grouping Object. They can be moved, rotated, scaled and animated or even hidden and revealed. Create multiple Grouping Objects to hold different areas of a scene, or related props and figures. Adding selected scene elements into any Grouping Object is easy using our powerful new Context Menu controls. This significant new feature will change how you manage your scenes, providing you plenty of control over whole groups of objects in that scene.\n\n\nMulti-select drag and drop from Library\n\nWhen we introduced Drag and Drop support in Poser's Library, our users found it so much easier to apply materials, or conform clothing, or drop a pose right onto a figure. With the Library's new Multi-select feature, you'll be able to select several items of clothing and drag them right onto a figure and auto-conform them in one step. But it gets even better when working with multiple categories of items in your Favorites; Multi-select a hairstyle, several clothing items and a pose all at once, then click and drag them right onto your target figure. Poser will automatically apply the items. It doesn't get much easier.\n\n\nMorph Tool Tablet Support\n\nIf you own a Wacom pressure sensitive tablet, Poser is going to make you a very happy camper. We've engineered Wacom tablet support into the Morph Tool so you can have much finer control when creating morphs. Vary brush strength with pressure for any brush size you've set. The Morph Tool is powerful, but with tablet support, it's gotten even better.\n\n\nConstraint Channels and Constraint Objects\n\nFor our animators that have been looking for a way to animate a ball being throw or caught, we've introduced Constraint Channels and Objects. Basically, the Constraint is an animatable handle for an object that will allow you to parent it to a figure's hand as it winds up for the throw, and then have the object leave the hand and fly through the air as if it's being thrown. Constraints are a simple to use feature that will permit all kinds of cool animation effects.\n\n\nLight Casting Objects\n\nWe changed the face of rendering in Poser when we introduced Indirect Lighting (IDL). And it became obvious when Poser users discovered that IDL enabled objects with high ambient values to cast light that with a few tweaks we could open up a huge array of lighting effects. Now you can toggle off visibility in rendering for objects, yet still enable them to cast light. This will allow the creation of light domes, environment domes and large area lights to cast ambient light without being rendered in the scene. Combined with our new Poser Scene Library category, this feature will be a great way to deliver a fully lit IDL environment.\n\n\nOver 5GB of Poser Content\n\nPoser includes a complete collection of well organized, easy to find content supplied by talented third party content artists as well content created by the Smith Micro team of 3D artists. Fully articulated human skeletons that match the male and female figures body topology are included along with artist manikins, animals, dinosaurs and a dragon, robots, vehicles, toy and cartoon characters; over 140 ready to pose figures total. Various new poses, animations, light sets, props, and accessories to help new users get started are included in the Poser content installers.\n\n\n\n\n\nMacintosh:\n\n   Mac OS X 10.6, 10.7, 10.8 or 10.9\n   1.5 GHz Intel Core processor (Core 2 Duo or faster recommended, 64-bit CPU required for 64-bit support)\n   1 GB system RAM (4 GB or more recommended)\n   OpenGL enabled graphics card or chipset recommended (recent NVIDIA GeForce OR ATI Radeon required for advanced real-time preview features)\n   24-bit color display, 1440 x 900 minimum resolution\n   3 GB free hard disk space (6 GB recommended)\n   DVD-ROM drive (Physical product only)\n   Internet connection required for Content Paradise\n   AdobeÃ‚Â® FlashÃ‚Â® Player 11 or newer\n   AdobeÃ‚Â® AIRÃ‚Â® (external library)\n   Hosting plugins require a valid English language installation of their respective host application:\n       Maxon CINEMA 4D R10-14 (64 &amp; 32-bit)\n       Autodesk Maya 2010 - 2014 (64 &amp; 32-bit)\n       Newtek Light Wave 3D 9 - 11 (64 &amp; 32-bit)\n       ZBrush 4 or later required for GoZ interoperability\n\n\n\n\nInstallation:\n\nUnRAR and Install\n\nUse keymaker to register the application.\n\nThese instructions should be followed:\n- Enter any name with serial\n- Untick &quot;I would like to receive periodic communications from Smith Micro&quot;\n- Untick &quot;Submit Registration Online&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ³  That's it!
