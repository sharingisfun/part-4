Debut album Taking On the World was also released this year.\n\n Rankin's cousin Sharleen Spiteri, of fellow Scottish band Texas and ex drummer Thornton contributed backing vocals to several songs on the album.\n The single &quot;Better Days&quot; from the album made the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart.
