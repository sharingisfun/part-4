It began in violence and war as the Manchus swept down from the north, but invaders became emperors, with three generations of one family ruling the country. Among them, Michael Wood argues, was China's greatest emperor - Kangxi.\r\nUnder the Qing, China doubled in size to include Xinjiang in the far west, as well as Mongolia and Tibet, creating the essential shape of China today. The new dynasty tolerated a diversity of cultures and religions, including Islam. In Kaifeng, Michael visits a women's mosque with a female imam, a delightful scene that ends with laughter and selfies! The Qing also undertook huge cultural enterprises. At a traditional printing house where the wood blocks are hand-carved, we see how the Complete Tang Poems were reproduced - all 48,000 of them. We travel through the wintry countryside to a remote village where a hardy audience watch open-air opera in the snow and visit a painter's studio, and 'storytelling' houses in Yangzhou.\r\nIn the 18th century, China was arguably the greatest economy in the world, and we get a fabulous sense of the rich culture that came with prosperity. But then came the clash with the British, in the first Opium War, when a British expedition destroyed the Qing navy and extracted territory and trading rights. We leave with a glimpse of the future. 'Every dynasty has risen and declined,' says Michael, 'and has needed new life to regenerate, and this time the catalyst was the British.' Among the ports China ceded was an almost uninhabited island, Hong Kong, one of today's greatest financial centres, and Shanghai, a small town then but now one of the greatest cities in world.\r\n                 This Is Part 5 Of a 6 Part Series\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/21/The-Last-Empire-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3e/The-Last-Empire-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4c/The-Last-Empire-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7d/The-Last-Empire-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/34/The-Last-Empire-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6d/The-Last-Empire-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d0/The-Last-Empire-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a2/The-Last-Empire-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/48/The-Last-Empire-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ed/The-Last-Empire-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6c/The-Last-Empire-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b0/The-Last-Empire-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bf/The-Last-Empire-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cf/The-Last-Empire-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c2/The-Last-Empire-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/10/The-Last-Empire-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3011 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.30 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b071c2kf\r\n\r\n2)  Related Documentaries \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Ancestors \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Silk%20Roads%20and%20China%20Ships \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Golden%20Age \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Ming","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ed01850df403ae5bc642323c4b4c2bee908f37b","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Story+Of+China+The+Last+Empire+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGrou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ed01850df403ae5bc642323c4b4c2bee908f37b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,208,24,80,223,64,58,229,188,100,35,35,196,180,194,190,233,8,243,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
