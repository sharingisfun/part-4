Oscar Peterson's control of the piano is one of the most exquisite I've ever heard. In his runs, even though they're at least as rapid as any I've heard from classical pianists-- Mr. Peterson did have classical training for a while until his teacher wisely suggested that he move to playing jazz-- you can hear every single note clean and clear, which I don't always hear elsewhere. Someone mentioned his performance on &quot;Just a Gigolo.&quot; This song is full of contrast, and a simple song becomes an exhibition of the universe of human emotion. There are waves of exuberant playing suddenly followed by soft, reflective playing, and it all seems logical. &quot;Laura&quot; is also an example of fine, imaginative piano playing. In the tracks where Mr. Peterson is playing with his trio, the transitions between the solos are some of the smoothest I've ever heard. His trios have a wonderful sense of balance and follow each other perfectly dynamically, knowing how to highlight the soloist to best effect. Unlike so many I've heard who use beautiful music to make jazz, Oscar Peterson is one of the few who use jazz to make beautiful music. I emphatically recommend this CD to those who are studying to play jazz and want to hear some exquisite stuff to learn from; and to those who want to have pleasure from an album of beautiful music to &quot;unwind&quot; to[/quote]\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Oscar Peterson - Jazz 'Round Midnight\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Oscar Peterson\nAlbum................: Jazz 'Round Midnight\nGenre................: Jazz\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1989\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 100 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
