Why should we believe in God?  What evidence is there?  Where does right and wrong come from?  Do people who do wrong believe they are doing right?  What basic tenets of morality seem to be established from birth?  Lewis is an amazing thinker who can explain much of his thoughts even to me.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2919beee7e9f4190f1f8d2bb3b50abc9aff052f8","amp;dn":"Mere+Christianity+-+C.+S.+Lewis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2919beee7e9f4190f1f8d2bb3b50abc9aff052f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,25,190,238,126,159,65,144,241,248,210,187,59,80,171,201,175,240,82,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
