The basic text clarifies the Steps which constitute the A.A. way of life and the Traditions, by which A.A. maintains its unity.\n\nNOTE: I put AAWS/Bill Wilson because it was in fact written by Bill Wilson however it does NOT state his name on the cover or anywhere else because of the 11th Tradition which states:\n\n&quot;Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio, and films.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7c9720c4565b4dbeb6c23e073f9a1263db66de0","amp;dn":"Twelve+Steps+And+Twelve+Traditions+By+Alcoholics+Anonymous.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7c9720c4565b4dbeb6c23e073f9a1263db66de0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,201,114,12,69,101,180,219,235,108,35,224,115,249,161,38,61,182,109,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
