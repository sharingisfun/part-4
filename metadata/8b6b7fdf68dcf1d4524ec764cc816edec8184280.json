Not knowing this fact is a severe handicap, as the Universe is designed to care for and nurture all its creatures and help make our lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journey easier and more successful. When we learn how to connect with our angelic guides, our lives naturally fall into a pattern of ease and flow during which we grow our souls, fulfill our lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s purpose, and make our time on Earth endlessly entertaining. This fascinating and inspirational book by Sonia Choquette provides all the information you need to help you connect with your spirit guides so that you can enjoy all the love, abundance, and joy youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re entitled to.\n\n-----------------\n\ncreated by Yasser Adnan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b6b7fdf68dcf1d4524ec764cc816edec8184280","amp;dn":"Ask+Your+Guides+-+by+Sonia+Choquette+-+Yasser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b6b7fdf68dcf1d4524ec764cc816edec8184280","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,107,127,223,104,220,241,212,82,78,199,100,204,129,110,222,200,24,66,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
