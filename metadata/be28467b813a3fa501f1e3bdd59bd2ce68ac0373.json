Now you must find your way out... or stay trapped forever.\r\nWelcome to UNDERTALE, an RPG game where you don't have to kill anyone. Each enemy can be &quot;defeated&quot; nonviolently. Dance with a slime. Pet a dog. Whisper your favorite secret to a knight.\r\nOr, ignore this choice and rain destruction upon your foes.\r\nBut your journey will take determination. Each adversary has unique bullet patterns that you must dodge as well (don't worry, it's not that hard).\r\n\r\n- Killing is unnecessary: negotiate out of danger using the unique battle system.\r\n- Time your attacks for extra damage, then dodge enemy attacks in a style reminiscent of top-down shooters.\r\n- Soulful, character-rich story with an emphasis on humor.\r\n- Created mostly by one person.\r\n- Become friends with all of the bosses!\r\n- At least 5 dogs.\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements (from GOG):\r\n\r\nUbuntu 14.04, 16.04 or later\r\nProcessor: 2GHz+\r\nMemory: 2 GB RAM\r\nStorage: 200 MB available space\r\n\r\nRequires the following packages to be installed: libc6:i386 libasound2:i386 libasound2-data:i386 libasound2-plugins:i386 libcurl3:i386 libgtk2.0-0:i386 libopenal1:i386 libglu1:i386 and dependencies.\r\n\r\nNotice: this game comes with a 32-bit binary only","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be28467b813a3fa501f1e3bdd59bd2ce68ac0373","amp;dn":"Undetale+%28GOG%29+%7C+Linux+%7C+TRANsPARENT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be28467b813a3fa501f1e3bdd59bd2ce68ac0373","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,40,70,123,129,58,63,165,1,241,227,189,213,155,210,206,104,172,3,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
