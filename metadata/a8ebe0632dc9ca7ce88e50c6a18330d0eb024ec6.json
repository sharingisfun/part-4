Kawasaki (Reality Check: The Irreverent Guide to Outsmarting, Outmanaging and Outmarketing Your Competition, 2011, etc.) transforms the otherwise exhausted and overwrought tropes of how to win friends and influence people with a complete makeover here, whether he's talking about wardrobe choice or tips for effective swearing.\n\nThe author, a modern-day Dale Carnegie, offers explanations on how to wield the most influence in the digital age: Push Technologies like presentations, e-mails and Twitter are discussed as active means of enchanting others, while Pull Technologies like Facebook, YouTube and LinkedIn passively draw them in. The author's suggestions for achieving likeability and trustworthiness, as well as overcoming resistance, are thoroughly explained and can easily translate from the workplace to the real world.\n\nKawasaki makes good use of subheads and bullet points, rendering information in a searchable format. He ends each chapter with an anecdote that illuminates the effectiveness of his techniquesÃ¢â‚¬â€while it's not original, it's effective. The author's trademark light and airy style is on display, but it's his humor and empathy that makes the heavy use of BusinessSpeak and buzzwords more easily palatable.\n\nInformative, concise guide from one of America's most influential and, yes, enchanting entrepreneurs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8ebe0632dc9ca7ce88e50c6a18330d0eb024ec6","amp;dn":"Enchantment+-+The+Art+of+Changing+Hearts%2C+Minds%2C+and+Actions+-+G","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8ebe0632dc9ca7ce88e50c6a18330d0eb024ec6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,235,224,99,45,201,202,124,232,142,80,198,161,131,48,208,235,2,78,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
