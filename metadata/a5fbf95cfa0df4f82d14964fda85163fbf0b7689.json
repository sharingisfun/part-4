We have often been asked when Nave would be available on other platforms. This new Nave brings that notable Nave sound engine to your favourite DAW.\n\nDesigners have optimized its spectacular graphical user interface to work with the tried-and-tested computer combo of keyboard and mouse (or track pad) rather than touch screen surface technology, yet nothing has been lost in translation.\n\nThe featured-packed Nave comes pre-packed with superb sounds, ranging from spatial pads to vivid wavetable scans and cutting leads to solid basses, but, above and beyond that, also an abundance of incredibly imaginative sound worlds Ã¢â‚¬â€œ many of them professionally produced by some of the top sound designers around.\n\nblades beschnittenAs a synthesizer thoroughbred at heart, Nave really represents a phenomenal playground for sound creation creativity. Its oscillators offer expanded wavetable functionality with elaborate editing facilities and an extremely effective speech synthesizer.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nN0TES\n\n@Waldorf: do you use Syncroshit protection because you like the name or because it works for your purpose? (that is protecting your software, in theory)\n\nThis is the worst soft-eLicenser implementation ever.\n\nIf you really need to make your users (the paying ones) have useless 3rd party CP software installed and also pay an inflated retail price for the protection licensing costs at least read Syncrosoft's documentation and do it properly!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGREETZ!\nALL PRESENT, PAST &amp; FUTURE TEAMS AND iNDs\nWHO MADE AUDiO WAREZ HiSTORY\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSUPPORT GOOD DEVS WHO DON'T TORTURE USERS\nWiTH SHiTTY PROTECTiONS AND BUY WHAT YOU USE AND LiKE!\n\nNFO v.1.1 - 09.2014\n- C0ME T0 THE DARK SiDE -\n- HEXWARS -\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndemonoid.pw\n1337x.to\nthepiratebay.se\nflashtorrents.org\ncastradio.net\nbtdigg.org\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXV (05)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5fbf95cfa0df4f82d14964fda85163fbf0b7689","amp;dn":"Waldorf+-+Nave+v1.01+OS+X+%5BHEXWARS%5D%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5fbf95cfa0df4f82d14964fda85163fbf0b7689","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,251,249,92,250,13,244,248,45,20,150,79,218,133,22,63,191,11,118,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
