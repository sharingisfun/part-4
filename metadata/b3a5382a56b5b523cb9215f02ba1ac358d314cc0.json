This single-disc compilation covers the whole journey, from her earliest hits with the Springfields (&quot;Silver Threads and Golden Needles&quot;) to her solo hits (&quot;Wishin' and Hopin,&quot; &quot;Son of a Preacher Man&quot;) and her collaboration with the Pet Shop Boys (&quot;What Have I Done to Deserve This&quot;). While Rhino's three-disc Anthology is still probably the best comprehensive introduction to Springfield on the market, this one has the added advantage of including three early tracks from the Springfields, as well as tracks featuring her later orchestrated adult contemporary style.\nAll Music Review by Steve Leggett\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Wishin' And Hopin'\n[02] Little By Little\n[03] All Cried Out\n[04] Losing You\n[05] Son Of A Preacher Man\n[06] All I See Is You\n[07] In The Middle Of Nowhere\n[08] What Have I Done To Deserve This\n[09] Goin' Back\n[10] Island Of Dreams\n[11] I'll Try Anything\n[12] Reputation\n[13] Stay Awhile\n[14] In Private\n[15] Time And Time Again\n[16] I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself\n[17] I Only Want To Be With You\n[18] Windmills Of Your Mind\n[19] Silver Threads And Golden Needles\n[20] Say I Won't Be There\n[21] Some Of Your Lovin'\n[22] The Look Of Love\n[23] I Close My Eyes And Count To Ten\n[24] Nothing Has Been Proved\n[25] You Don't Have To Say You Love Me\n\nPlay Time - 01h:18m:38s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 187mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
