His main project was Bright Eyes, an eclectic group of rotating musicians that vacillated between pop, folk, electronica, and country-rock. Although Oberst remained at the center of that band, he also logged time in a number of other outfits, including Commander Venus, the Magentas, Park Ave., Desaparecidos, and an early version of the Faint. Finally, he supported like-minded artists on an executive level, co-founding Saddle Creek Records in the '90s and launching his own label, Team Love, in 2003.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df5cf17c8cc15d8dcc62a897c50fd2d3e7d9eded","amp;dn":"Conor+Oberst+-+Upside+Down+Mountain+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df5cf17c8cc15d8dcc62a897c50fd2d3e7d9eded","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,92,241,124,140,193,93,141,204,98,168,151,197,15,210,211,231,217,237,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
