Written with the needs of the learner very much in mind, it sets out the grammar of the language in a clear and jargon-free style. \n\n The book not only explains the fundamentals of the grammar, but also tests students' understanding in an interactive way with more than 200 exercises. Key grammar points are summarised in tables and there are numerous illustrative examples. A list of grammatical terms used in the book and a key to all the exercises are also provided. This essential grammar and exercise book can be used as a supplement for students studying the language, with a dual function as a reference guide to look up grammar points, and as a resource from which exercises can be set and language skills practised.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e2c1da22aed857aee5b996ac595d4bf7c18e42a","amp;dn":"A+Student+Grammar+of+Turkish+%282012%29+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e2c1da22aed857aee5b996ac595d4bf7c18e42a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,44,29,162,42,237,133,122,238,91,153,106,197,149,212,191,124,24,228,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
