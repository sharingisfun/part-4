The latter comparison makes sense, of course, as Nickelback singer Chad Kroeger co-wrote many of the record's tunes, and Theory was the first signing to his 604 Records imprint. With GASOLINE, however, the band took Kroeger's well-developed melodic sense and ran with it, delivering a disc bristling with catchy tunes, unafraid to dispense with the grunge formula.\n\nLike Stone Temple Pilots, Theory of a Deadman is a pop band at heart, often singing about love and relationships gone wrong over a wide variety of musical textures. &quot;No Surprise&quot; employs an old-school 1970s-rock shuffle beat, while &quot;Hello Lonely (Walk Away from This)&quot; is based on a funky syncopated chord progression reminiscent of Jeff Buckley's &quot;Last Goodbye.&quot; &quot;In the Middle&quot; is a tuneful ballad that could almost pass for a Nashville country song in the hands of, say, Keith Urban. Other tracks feature slide guitar, strings, and a host of other production touches, all of which help make GASOLINE an unusually diverse and satisfying rock record.\n[Source: cduniverse.com]\n\nOriginal Release Year: 2005\nGenre: Rock\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01.
