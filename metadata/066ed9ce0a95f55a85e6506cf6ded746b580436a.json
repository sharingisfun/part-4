Updated and thoroughly revised, this foundational resource surveys all major topics related to the U.S. public health system, including organization on local and national levels, financing, workforce, goals, initiatives, accountability, and metrics. The text is unique in combining the perspectives of both academicians and public health officials, and examines new job opportunities and the growing interest in the public health field.\n\nComprehensive and accessible, the text discusses a variety of new trends in public health, particularly regarding primary care and public health partnerships. The second edition also includes information about new accountability initiatives and workforce requirements to contribute to health services research and clinical outcomes research in medical care. The text stresses the increasing emphasis on efficiency, effectiveness, and equity in achieving population health improvements, and goes beyond merely presenting information to analyze the question of whether the practice of public health achieves its promise. Each chapter includes objectives, review questions, and case studies. Also included are an instructor's manual with test questions (covering every major public health improvement initiative and introducing every major data system sponsored by the U.S. public health system) and PowerPoint slides. The book's nine chapters address the history of U.S. public health from its inception and offer a sweeping examination of topics in organization and financing, infectious disease control, injury and noninfectious diseases, system performance, system improvement, public health leadership, building healthy communities, and the future of public health.\n\nNew to the Second Edition:\n\nCompletely updated and revised\nAddresses changes brought about by Obamacare\nDiscusses building healthy communities and the determinants of health\nAdds new chapter on public health leadership\nCovers new developments in treating Lyme disease, West Nile virus, and other illnesses\nInvestigates intentional injuries such as suicide, homicide, and war\nKey Features:\n\nProvides information that is holistic, comprehensive, and accessible\nCovers all major topics of organization, financing, leadership, goals, initiatives, accountability, and metrics\nRelates current public health practice to the field's history and mission\nAnalyzes successful and unsuccessful aspects of health care delivery","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:066ed9ce0a95f55a85e6506cf6ded746b580436a","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Public+Health%2C+2E-+Goldstein+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"066ed9ce0a95f55a85e6506cf6ded746b580436a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,110,217,206,10,149,245,90,133,230,80,108,246,222,215,70,181,128,67,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
