What is the meaning of life? Why does the universe exist? Unfolding his personal, compelling vision of the universe, the eminent British cosmologist evaluates a variety of intricate ideas, from 'Intelligent Design' to the impact the search for the Higgs Boson particle at CERN could have on our understanding of the cosmos. Drawing on more than 40 years of his own research and a recent series of observations and theoretical breakthroughs, Hawking presents his original and controversial theories, applying current scientific understanding to these complex concepts. Combining cutting edge visuals with this witty and incisive world view discover how physics and cosmology are being used to tackle ideas that philosophers have struggled with for thousands of years\n\n\n\n2)  The Meaning of Life \nHawking tackles the ultimate question: Is there a meaning to our lives? Is there a purpose to our existence? This used to be the realm of religion or philosophy - not science. But Hawking believes philosophy is dead and that science holds the key. So what can the laws of physics tell us about who and what we humans really are? Do we have free will or are we just complex biological machines working to the laws of nature? From Descartes to the latest advances in quantum physics, Hawking explores this fascinating territory with his famous fearless zeal as he questions the very nature of reality itself. You will never look at yourself the same way again.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img20/3171/granddesignscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img20/3171/granddesignscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img824/792/granddesignscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img824/792/granddesignscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img59/7089/granddesignscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img59/7089/granddesignscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img9/7275/granddesignscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img9/7275/granddesignscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img715/8510/granddesignscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img715/8510/granddesignscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img846/2633/granddesignscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img846/2633/granddesignscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img829/432/granddesignscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img829/432/granddesignscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img835/7643/granddesignscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img835/7643/granddesignscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img11/2999/granddesignscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img11/2999/granddesignscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 2270\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 45.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 3\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discoveryuk.com/web/stephen-hawkings-grand-design/episode-guide/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discoveryuk.com/web/stephen-hawkings-grand-design/episode-guide/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b832d183a78016d8fe12d8200e13268282e91b2","amp;dn":"Discovery+Ch+Stephen+Hawkings+Grand+Design+2of3+The+Meaning+of+L","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b832d183a78016d8fe12d8200e13268282e91b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,131,45,24,58,120,1,109,143,225,45,130,0,225,50,104,40,46,145,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
