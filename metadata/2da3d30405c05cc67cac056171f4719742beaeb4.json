Enjoy\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIf you know the theme song, then you know that the Addams Family is coming to a television near you. This animated series is the fourth incarnation of the creepy characters based on the macabre family comics created by Charles Addams. It first came out as a television series in the 1960&amp;#039;s. They then became animated in the 70&amp;#039;s, first in their own animated series, and then an appearance in The New Scooby-Doo Movies around the same time. The family then went movie-bound in the early 90&amp;#039;s as they were put on the big screen. It was a hit at the box office, which prompted a sequel (Addams Family Values), but before then, this second animated series that features the gang of macabre miscreants who have their own unusual ways of having fun adventures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2da3d30405c05cc67cac056171f4719742beaeb4","amp;dn":"Cartoon+-+The+Addams+Family+TAS+%281992%29+21+episodes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2da3d30405c05cc67cac056171f4719742beaeb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,163,211,4,5,192,92,198,124,172,5,97,113,244,113,151,66,190,174,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
