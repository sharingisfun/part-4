A pioneer of counterculture-era psychedelic rock, the group was the first band from the San Francisco scene to achieve international mainstream success. They performed at the three most famous American rock festivals of the 1960sÃ¢â‚¬â€Monterey (1967), Woodstock (1969) and Altamont (1969)Ã¢â‚¬â€as well as headlining the first Isle of Wight Festival (1968). Their 1967 record Surrealistic Pillow is regarded as one of the key recordings of the &quot;Summer of Love&quot;. Two hits from that album, &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; and &quot;White Rabbit&quot;, are listed in Rolling Stone's &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.\n\nThe membership of Jefferson Airplane remained stable from 1967 to early 1970. During that period, they enjoyed success as &quot;album&quot; artists. Between 1967 and 1972 they scored a run of eight consecutive Top 20 albums in the USA, with both Surrealistic Pillow and Crown of Creation making the Top 10. Despite a lack of top ten singles following their initial success, many of their singles still managed to make minor chart positions in the singles chart due in part to the growing influence of FM radio, which played many rock songs that AM radio did not. Successor bands to Jefferson Airplane include Jefferson Starship and Starship; spinoffs include Hot Tuna and KBC Band. Jefferson Airplane was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJefferson Airplane Takes Off is the debut album of San Francisco rock band Jefferson Airplane, released in August 1966 as RCA Victor LSP-3584 (stereo) &amp; LPM-3584 (mono). The personnel differ from the later &quot;classic&quot; lineup and the music is more folk-rock than the harder psychedelic sound for which the band later became famous. Signe Toly Anderson was the female vocalist and Skip Spence played drums. Both left the group shortly after the album's release and were replaced by Grace Slick and Spencer Dryden, respectively.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSurrealistic Pillow is the second album by American rock band Jefferson Airplane, released in February 1967 as RCA Victor LSP-3766 (stereo) &amp; LPM-3766 (mono). It is the first album by the band with vocalist Grace Slick and drummer Spencer Dryden. The album peaked at #3 on the Billboard album chart, and has been certified a gold album by the RIAA.\n\nOriginal drummer Alexander 'Skip' Spence had left the band in mid-1966, replaced by Los Angeles jazz drummer Spencer Dryden, a nephew of Charlie Chaplin. New lead vocalist Slick, formerly with another San Francisco rock band the Great Society, joined the Airplane in the fall of 1966. Slick and Dryden in place on this album and its attendant singles completed the best-known line-up of the group, which would remain stable until Dryden's departure in early 1970.\n\nThe album is considered to be one of the quintessential works of the early psychedelic rock and counterculture eras.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter Bathing at Baxter's, the third album by the San Francisco rock band Jefferson Airplane was released in 1967 as RCA Victor LSO-1511 (stereo) &amp; LOP-1511 (mono).\n\nAfter Bathing at Baxter's is notably psychedelic and provided a contrast to the band's previous album, Surrealistic Pillow, released earlier the same year, as it eschews the more commercial type rock songs, such as &quot;Somebody to Love,&quot; that appeared on the earlier LP. As such, it was a watershed album; Jefferson Airplane was now a much heavier rock group. Jorma Kaukonen's electric guitar was especially more to the forefront in both volume and tone.\n\nDivided into &quot;suites,&quot; this musical shift is typified by longer and more experimental compositions such as the nine-minute instrumental &quot;Spare Chaynge&quot; (reputedly put together by Spencer Dryden when no-one else in the band showed up to a recording session) and Grace Slick's mammoth and unusual &quot;Rejoyce,&quot; an homage to James Joyce's novel Ulysses, with its quirky arrangement and Jack Casady's stentorian bass line. Many of the album tracks reflect the band's heavy use of the drug LSD. The cover art is by artist Ron Cobb.\n\nThe album peaked at no. 17. The first single, &quot;The Ballad of You and Me and Pooneil,&quot; barely missed the top 40 mark, charting at #42 while the second release, &quot;Watch Her Ride,&quot; charted at #61 on Billboard. Both singles made it to the top 40 in the Cash Box Top 100. The band would continue its major commercial success the next year with Crown of Creation.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCrown of Creation was released in 1968 and is the fourth album by the San Francisco rock band Jefferson Airplane, released as RCA Victor LSP-4058 (stereo). A mono version was released only to radio in the US (as LPM-4058), but was released commercially in other countries. This was the last Jefferson Airplane album to be released in mono. In addition, although the cover features the newer &quot;modern&quot; RCA Victor logos, initial stereo pressings and all mono pressings were on the black &quot;Nipper&quot; label (instead of the orange label associated with those logos). The album peaked at number 6 on the album charts and was eventually certified gold. The David Crosby-penned &quot;Triad&quot; is the only track not composed by an Airplane member, except that the lyrics to the title song are based on lines from John Wyndham's novel The Chrysalids) - unattributed, but with his permission. &quot;Triad&quot; was previously rejected for release by Crosby's group The Byrds as being too risquÃƒÂ©.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBless Its Pointed Little Head is a live album by Jefferson Airplane recorded at both the Fillmore East and West in the fall of 1968 and released in 1969 as RCA Victor LSP-4133. Five songs on the album had not appeared on any of the band's previous studio recordings.\n\nThe 2004 CD reissue includes three bonus tracks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBand Members:\n\n\nPaul Kantner: guitars, vocals (1965Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1972, 1989, 1996)\n\nJorma Kaukonen: guitars, vocals (1965Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1972, 1989, 1996)\n\nMarty Balin: vocals, guitars (1965Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1971, 1989, 1996)\n\nSigne Toly Anderson: vocals (1965Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1966)\n\nBob Harvey: bass (1965)\n\nJerry Peloquin: drums (1965)\n\nJack Casady: bass (1965Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1972, 1989, 1996)\n\nSkip Spence: drums (1965Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1966, died 1999)\n\nGrace Slick: vocals (1966Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1972, 1989)\n\nSpencer Dryden: drums (1966Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1970, 1996, died 2005)\n\nPapa John Creach: violin (1970Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1972, 1989, died 1994)\n\nJoey Covington: drums (1970Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1972, died 2013)\n\nJohn Barbata: drums (1972)\n\nDavid Freiberg: vocals (1972)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a62b035bc5851d0d5c7a348f9e2c7b7b360b9a20","amp;dn":"Jefferson+Airplane%2FOriginal+Album+Classics-V1%5B5CD%5D%5B2008%5D%5B320KBPS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a62b035bc5851d0d5c7a348f9e2c7b7b360b9a20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,43,3,91,197,133,29,13,92,122,52,143,158,44,123,123,54,11,154,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
