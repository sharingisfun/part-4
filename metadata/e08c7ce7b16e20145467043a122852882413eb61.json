He first earned wider public attention for his breakthrough single &quot;Loser&quot;, a 1994 hit. Beck is known for creating musical collages of a wide range of styles.\n\n\nReview:\nRate:7.0 on pitchfork.com\nOn his tour behind 2006's The Information, Beck and his band were accompanied by a troupe of marionette doppelgÃƒÂ¤ngers. Projected onto a big screen, the dot-eyed puppets mimicked the group with uncanny accuracy; if Beck triumphantly raised his hand during &quot;Devil's Haircut&quot;, his counterpart quickly followed. As the distance between concert DVDs and concerts themselves continues to dwindle, the puppet scheme was a winning example of spontaneous, analog cleverness. It was also a crafty bit of outsourcing. The cute figurines provided much of the night's visual entertainment while offering a distraction from Beck's increasingly uninvolved performances. Since the famed stops on his Odelay tour more than a decade ago, he's become a static shell of his former break-dancing, bed-humping self. Similarly, while Beck has gotten darker and more apocalyptic, he's tried to temper his direness with upbeat, counter-punch production from the Dust Brothers, Nigel Godrich, and now, Danger Mouse. Though Modern Guilt is more direct and consistent than his last two scattershot LPs, it also finds the disillusioned L.A. hippie struggling to balance his deathly outlook with his more crowd-pleasing inclinations.\nYou can read the rest at pitchfork.\nI can tell you it is a great album...a little bit different from the usual Beck.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - Orphans.mp3\n02 - Gamma Ray.mp3\n03 - Chemtrails.mp3\n04 - Modern Guilt.mp3\n05 - Youthless.mp3\n06 - Walls.mp3\n07 - Replica.mp3\n08 - Soul of a Man.mp3\n09 - Profanity Prayers.mp3\n10 - Volcano.mp3\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry: USA\nGenre: Alternative rock\nStyles: anti-folk, electronic music, alternative hip-hop\n\n\nMedia Report:\nSource : CD\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e08c7ce7b16e20145467043a122852882413eb61","amp;dn":"%282013%29+Beck+-+Modern+Guilt+%40+320+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e08c7ce7b16e20145467043a122852882413eb61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,140,124,231,177,110,32,20,84,103,4,58,18,40,82,136,36,19,235,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
