Grusin and Rosen signed him to GRP (via Arista Records) and Browne broke onto the music scene in 1979 with a highly acclaimed instrumental jazz fusion album Browne Sugar, although this was not released in the UK. His first real breakthrough came in 1980 with the release of &quot;Funkin&amp;#039; For Jamaica&quot;, taken from his second album Love Approach. The single hit #1 on Billboard&amp;#039;s Hot Soul Singles for 4 weeks, and was also a UK Top 10 hit, and featured the lead vocals of Tonni Smith (later a voice allegedly utilized by S-Express on &amp;#039;Theme From S-Express&amp;#039;).\n\n&quot;Funkin&amp;#039; for Jamaica,&quot; which earned him a gold single and today, is still a favorite among dance DJ&amp;#039;s around the world.\n\nContinuing his association with producers Grusin and Rosen, his next albums were Yours Truly (1981), including &quot;Fungi Mama&quot; and &quot;Bye Gones&quot;, and &quot;Magic&quot; (1982), before he signed directly to Arista. Here he progressed into an electro style of jazz with &quot;Rockin&amp;#039; Radio&quot; from a 1983 album of the same name (which also included a final GRP production &quot;Brighter Tomorrow&quot;). In 1984 he recorded a final Arista album Tommy Gun, which featured Siedah Garrett singing lead on the leading moment &quot;Secret Fantasy&quot; produced by Maurice Starr. Also in 1984 he recorded with Fuse One on their Ice album.\n\n\n\n01. Funkin&amp;#039; For Jamaica\n02. Thighs High\n03. Bye Gones\n04. Never My Love\n05. Brighter Tomorrow\n06. Lazy Bird\n07.
