Paul West is about to experience his first summer on the land. Will he have enough water, food and produce to keep the farm thriving throughout the dryer months? More than ever he'll need to rely on the expertise of friends and neighbours to help him expand the farm. He has got big plans to increase his livestock and has his sights set on impregnating some of the farm animals but as Paul quickly learns you can't control nature. And that includes his beloved best friend Digger, who has grown from a playful pup to a rebellious teenager. To continue to live on the farm with Paul Digger will need discipline.\n\nIf you see &quot;Hector&quot; on the end of a file it means I capped it.\nEnjoy, Gaz/Hector :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58d8e233a4816b254a6ef8a4da5526ce507aa905","amp;dn":"River.Cottage.Australia.s02e01.PDTV.x264.Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58d8e233a4816b254a6ef8a4da5526ce507aa905","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,216,226,51,164,129,107,37,74,110,248,164,218,85,38,206,80,122,169,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
