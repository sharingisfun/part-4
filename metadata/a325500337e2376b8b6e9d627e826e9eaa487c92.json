Richard's expert arrangements and Karen's superb voice combined to create something special. They recorded plenty of original songs but some of their biggest hits were covers. Close to you is a Bacharach-David song, originally recorded by Dionne Warwick, but her version was not released as a single. Please Mr Postman was a huge American success for the Marvelettes (and was covered by the Beatles on one of their early albums). Jambalaya is an old Hank Williams song, while Ticket to ride is a Beatles classic.  Of the original songs, Top of the world was never originally intended to be a single. However, Lynn Anderson covered the song and had a major country hit with it. She might have had a pop hit, too, but the Carpenters wisely decided to release their own version.  The strangest song here is Calling occupants of interplanetary craft. Whether you like it or not, it demonstrates that Richard and Karen were always trying to do something different.  There are so many classics here including For all we know, We've only just begun, Rainy days and Mondays, Goodbye to love, Only yesterday, Yesterday once more and I won't last a day without you. You can't get all the great Carpenters songs on a single CD but the songs here are all excellent. Among the omissions are Hurting each other, Sweet sweet smile and All you get from love is a love song, but if those were included, others would have to be left out. - Amazon Review By  Peter Durward Harris  \n\t\nCD - Track Listings\n\n[01] Yesterday Once More\n[02] Superstar\n[03] Rainy Days And Mondays\n[04] Goodbye To Love\n[05] It's Going To Take Some Time\n[06] I Won't Last A Day Without You\n[07] For All We Know\n[08] Jambalaya (On The Bayou)\n[09] Touch Me When We're Dancing\n[10] Please Mr. Postman\n[11] I Need To Be In Love\n[12] Solitaire\n[13] We've Only Just Begun\n[14] (They Long To Be) Close To You\n[15] This Masquerade\n[16] Ticket To Ride\n[17] Top Of The World\n[18] Only Yesterday\n[19] Sing\n[20] Calling Occupants Of Interplanetary Craft\n\nCD - Play Time - 01h:16m:02s\n\t\nTotal File Size....................... 454mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
