The first recorded Psycho Realm song, &quot;Scandalous&quot;, was released on the soundtrack of the film Mi Vida Loca in 1994. That same year B-Real of the rap group Cypress Hill saw Psycho Realm performing at Olvera Street for an End Barrio Warfare concert. Their performance inspired B-Real to the point that he wanted to join the group. With this time period being the height of Cypress HillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career anything Cypress Hill related would get major publicity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c661e14182340c9b2414e3f5a3e9e77ee000e3a6","amp;dn":"The+Psycho+Realm-The+Psycho+Realm+1997+..320kbps+%28stPaddy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c661e14182340c9b2414e3f5a3e9e77ee000e3a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,97,225,65,130,52,12,155,36,20,227,245,163,233,231,126,224,0,227,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
