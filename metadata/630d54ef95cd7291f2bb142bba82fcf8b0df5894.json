Then life changes for two of the guys when they meet a pair of career criminals and get falsely arrested in connection with stealing a Cadillac. We follow their lives through the end of high school and the dramatic end to their school year.\n\nThis was requested, and is the best copy I could find...\n\nREVIEW: (From IMDB)\n\nThis was the very first movie I ever saw in my life back in 1974 or 1975. I was 4 years old at the time and saw it at a drive-in theatre. I did not grasp that this would be a classic at the time (I went to sleep about twenty minutes into the movie). After seeing it on the television-along with two of my other favourite movies Car Wash (my favourite movie) and The Wiz which seemed to come on every year about the same time all together-about 40, 50, 75 times I knew that here was a movie that I would have as one of my favourites. Those three movies were the only live action shows that I could watch as a child.\n\nI would not consider this to be a blaxploitation movie but rather an urban interest movie.Cochise and Preach reminded me of some of my uncles especially the Wild Irish Rose that they drank. My mother also told me about some of the quarter parties that she attended and that some of the things that occurred in the movie were similar in nature to what occurred in real life. If you are one of the two or three black people over thirty who hasn't seen this movie yet then I recommend that you buy the DVD right now. I'm glad that I was around to witness some of the goings on of the era.\n\n\nSCREENS:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/1437/vlcsnap2011011608h42m29.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/1437/vlcsnap2011011608h42m29.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/315/vlcsnap2011011608h42m37.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/315/vlcsnap2011011608h42m37.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img225.imageshack.us/img225/3927/vlcsnap2011011608h42m46.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img225.imageshack.us/img225/3927/vlcsnap2011011608h42m46.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSEED AND ENJOY FOLKS!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:630d54ef95cd7291f2bb142bba82fcf8b0df5894","amp;dn":"Cooley+High+%281975%29+-+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"630d54ef95cd7291f2bb142bba82fcf8b0df5894","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,13,84,239,149,205,114,145,242,187,20,43,186,130,252,248,176,223,88,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
