Yogi Goswami (CRC, 2008).pdf\r\n\r\nWhile researchers work overtime to create new technologies and methods of providing energy, it is critical that modern industry makes the most efficient use of the energy that is currently available. The Energy Management and Conservation Handbook offers expert guidance on the planning and design of â€œgreenâ€ technologies. It focuses on management strategies for better utilization of energy in buildings and industry as well as ways of improving energy efficiency at the end use. Renowned authorities from around the globe share insights and modern points of view on a broad spectrum of topics.\r\nSummarizing proven energy efficient technologies in the building sector, the book includes examples that highlight the cost-effectiveness of some of these technologies. It introduces basic methods for designing and sizing cost-effective systems and determining whether it is economically efficient to invest in specific energy efficiency or renewable energy projects. It provides guidance for computing measures of economic performance for relatively simple investment choices and the fundamentals for dealing with complex investment decisions. The book also describes energy audit producers commonly used to improve the energy efficiency of residential and commercial buildings as well as industrial facilities.\r\n\r\nAfter developing the basics of HVAC control, the book explores operational needs for successfully maintained operations. It describes the essentials of control systems for heating, ventilating, and air conditioning of buildings designed for energy conserving operation. The book also defines demand-side management, covers its role in integrated resource planning, and delineates the main elements of its programs. The book demonstrates these concepts with case studies of successful demand-side management programs. These features and more provide the tools necessary to improve energy management leading to higher energy efficiencies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be6dc976aa3fa9ac356373757de464aa5267973e","amp;dn":"Energy+Management+and+Conservation+Handbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be6dc976aa3fa9ac356373757de464aa5267973e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,109,201,118,170,63,169,172,53,99,115,117,125,228,100,170,82,103,151,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
