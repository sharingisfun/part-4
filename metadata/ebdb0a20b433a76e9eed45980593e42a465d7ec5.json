But thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not all! Check out what the new release of AudioGate Version 2.0 means to youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nOK, first things first. AudioGate has evolved into a veritable Rosetta Stone when it comes to translating your recordings to other file formats. As of Version 2, you can now important and export in the following formats:\n\n      - WAV\n      - BWF\n      - AIFF\n      - MP3*3 (export Windows only)\n      - AAC*1 (export Mac only)\n      - Apple Lossless*1 (export Mac only)\n      - WMA (including WMA Professional and WMA Lossless ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ export Windows only)\n      - DSDIFF\n      - DSF\n      - WSD\n\nWebsite:  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.korg.com/ClassDetail.aspx?ID=123&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.korg.com/ClassDetail.aspx?ID=123&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudioGate 2.0 also adds FLAC file support ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the most popular lossless form of data compression.\n\nIn addition to editing features like gain, fade, balance, and DC cut which AudioGate previously included, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve now got some new ones. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNormalizeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ automatically adjusts so that you can export files at their highest level without clipping. Plus, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve not only improved the output level range from Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â± 24 dB to Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â± 60 dB, but weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve also expanded the peak level metering for better visual monitoring.\n\nAudioGate 2.0 ensures that you get great-sounding results when you down-convert from one sample rate/bit depth to another. It now includes standard TPDF (Triangular Probability Density Function) dithering, plus KorgÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own enhanced ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAQUAÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ dithering that closely follows human hearing characteristics for much more musical and natural sounding results.\n\nWant to listen to and share the results of your great DSD recordings? You can use the tools listed above and now burn your own audio CDs, complete with CD-Text. But since youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re recording with an MR Series recorder, we know you are into the latest and highest quality technology out there. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re right there with you. Now you can use AudioGate 2.0 to create DSD audio discs (1-bit/2.8 MHz) that preserve the superior audio fidelity that only 1-bit recording can deliver. You can play these enhanced discs in a variety of devices ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Sony PlayStation, VAIO computers, and certain stand-alone DVD players.\n\nYou might find this new feature handy. AudioGate 2.0 can load tracks from existing audio CDs, and it supports CD-text. No more jumbled up, unlabeled imports! Go ahead and change or add names if you want to as well, even edit multiple files at the same time to correct an artist name, album title, etc. You can even load, view, and change embedded graphic images like album artwork, session photos, and more.\n\nWhen you step away, you want to jump back into the music as quickly as possible. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why AudioGate 2.0 has some new useful features to help you do it. First of all, you can now view recently used songlists, so you can restart where you left off or make quick edits without having to redo work youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve already completed. Plus, AudioGate 2.0 comes with a new auto-save function that recovers the most recent songlist that was in use, even if you didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t shut down AudioGate properly. \n\n\nInstallation Info:\n1)install setup\n2)when asked for twitter close off as it is installed\n3)copy over the cracked .exe file to the install folder and copy over other one\nC : \\  Program Files\\KORG\\AudioGate  or  C : \\ Program Files(x86)\\KORG\\AudioGate\ndepending on windows installed  tested on winxp pro and win7 32bit\n4)Enjoy from Slickinator","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebdb0a20b433a76e9eed45980593e42a465d7ec5","amp;dn":"KORG+AudioGate+v2.1.0.3%2Bcrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebdb0a20b433a76e9eed45980593e42a465d7ec5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,219,10,32,180,51,167,110,158,237,69,152,5,147,228,42,70,93,126,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
