For each area studied there are only so many questions an examiner can ask; they are presented here with clear explanations that allow students to revise thoroughly one topic at a time. While doing so students can also practise their exam technique. Each book includes MCQs, EMQs, SAQs and Problem-based Questions - exactly the kind of questions students will get in their exams. Illustrated with simple, easy-to-reproduce line drawings, medical students have in this one volume all that they need for exam success.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62ce24332dd2a2b1abd0dcb84a927d62e0f6649e","amp;dn":"One+Stop+Doc+Cardiology+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62ce24332dd2a2b1abd0dcb84a927d62e0f6649e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,206,36,51,45,210,162,177,171,208,220,184,74,146,125,98,224,246,100,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
