The suits they wore in the cover were owned by manager Bill Aucoin.[citation needed]}\n\nWhile &quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot; remains a permanent staple in the band's concerts (often played to close out a show), there are several other songs still played from this release such as &quot;She&quot;, &quot;Rock Bottom&quot; and occasionaly &quot;C'Mon and Love Me&quot;\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    * Paul Stanley - rhythm guitar, vocals; lead guitar on 6; acoustic guitar on 5\n    * Gene Simmons - bass guitar, vocals; guitar on 3\n    * Ace Frehley - lead guitar; backing vocals on 10; acoustic guitar on 5\n    * Peter Criss - drums, percussion, vocals\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:862ce40ea86680ff87b4836769989ca0887c689e","amp;dn":"KISS+-+%5C%27Dressed+To+Kill%5C%27+%5BREMASTERED%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"862ce40ea86680ff87b4836769989ca0887c689e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,44,228,14,168,102,128,255,135,180,131,103,105,152,156,160,136,124,104,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
