RGTA is not a product of Rockstar North/Rockstar Games/Take 2 Games! RGTA is the ultimate collection of many GTA3 modifications made by independent authors from all-around the world. The intention of RGTA is to make GTA3 more realistic by adding real cars, buildings or advertisements all over Liberty City.\nSince it is free add-on, you can not profit on RGTA anyhow! Use RGTA at your own risk - I'm not responsible for any hardware or software break-downs or lost data/profit/business/information/wife;-).\nIf you thought GTA3 was brilliant, then you don't know RGTA:-). RGTA improves GTA3 in many ways - here's a brief list of RGTA features:\n\nNew Cars:\n(ALL cars have been changed to new ones - each one with unique handling, colors and 3D wheels.)\n\nSports cars:\n Lamborghini Murcielago + Diablo VT6.0 Porsche Carrera GT\nOpel Speedster  Dodge Viper GTS  Ferrari F355  BMW Z8\n Plymouth Prowler  Mercedes-Benz SL500  Aston Martin Vanquish V12\n\nSedans:\n Lexus LS430  BMW 760Li + M3 ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ Mercedes-Benz C200\nkoda Octavia  VW Passat  Mitsubishi Galant  MINI Cooper S\n\nHeavy vehicles:\n Freightliner  Coca Cola Truck  Kamaz 55111  City Bus\n Group 4 Securitas Car  new Trashmaster  new Orange Flatbed\n\nOff-road cars:\nChevrolet S-10  Cartell Crusher Monster Truck\n Hummer  Land Rover Freelander  Sarin XTV\n\nPublic service cars:\nNew Ambulance new Fire Truck  Police Ford Crown Victoria  T-80 tank\n SWAT Van (new Enforcer)  FBI BMW M5  Army Truck (new Barracks OL)\n Peugeot 406 Taxi  Ford Crown Victoria Taxi  Mercedes-Benz A-Class Taxi\n\nSpecial vehicles:\n RC Peugeot 205  Family Frost Van (new Mr.Whoopee)\n F-16  new Train  Toyz Mercedes-Benz Sprinter\n\nMob cars:\nCartel Jeep Grand Cherokee  Diablos Ford Mustang GT (Concept 2005)\nHoods Seat Leon Cupra R  Triad DAF XF 530 Mafia Audi S8\nLaundry Mercedes-Benz Sprinter  Panlantic Mercedes-Benz Sprinter\n Yakuza Toyota Supra Veilside  Yardie Chevrolet Monte Carlo\n\nNew Liberty City\n\nThese objects have been added to the city:\n Statue of Liberty - this awesome NY's statue has moved to Liberty City:-) You can find it on new island near the Kenji's casino (it's even marked on radar!), so you must use a boat to get there. There are some useful historical and technical information on statue's pedestal. If you want to see whole Liberty City from the birds-eye, use stairs to get into statue's head or torch! But don't fall down!\n Player of previous version of RGTA suggested a great idea - jump ramp to Liberty Island;). So it's in the game. Just take very fast car and try to be accurate in targeting the ramp - go wrong speed or direction and you won't land by the Statue of Liberty...you will fall into water:-). There's a boat by the Liberty Island ready to get you back to Staunton (you must start new game - boat won't be there if you load non-RGTA save games).\n New bridge - it is placed in Shoreside Vale and it's VERY useful, because it connects your hideout to the main road near the Francis Int. Airport. If you use Yakuza's Toyota Supra Veilside, you can get to Staunton from Shoreside in few seconds!!!\n\nThese new buildings' outfits are included:\n completely redesigned brownstone district in SV  Shell gas station Canadian hotels\nCoca Cola factory Quelle storage  IKEA  2x OBI  2x Media Markt NetCafe\n 4x Sparkasse bank Kenvelo Clothing  CineStar cinema Euro Express depot\n fast-foods Nordsee, 2x McDonald's and 2x Pizza Hut  Ford Service Mercedes-Benz Taxis\n\n\nNew weapons\n\nRGTA brings you completelly new arsenal - crowbar, Desert Eagle, uzi KG-9, shotgun Battle 7, MP5, Sig551, rocket launcher M79, sniper Rifle PSG-1, L2A2 grenades, new molotov and flamethrower model! The weapons are more effective (by 50% on average), so now it's really dangerous to hang around in the area of hostile gangs! Few bullets from any weapon are enough to get you killed...but on the other hand, you're invincible if you can use your weapons well!\n\n\nMisc stuff\n\nNew in-game menus and loading screens\n In-game texts changed to fit the RGTA\n New universal license plates for all cars\nNew realistic chrome reflections for all cars\n New billboards, posters and advertisements all over Liberty City (read the list of brands here)\n Water has got a new look\n All tress have been changed to beautiful palms\nUgly grey rocks/cliffs are now beige like in Greece;)\n Roads look more modern\n Pipes in water have been removed - you can travel by boat everywhere you want\n El Burro's xxx magazines are Playboy magazines, poster of naked Christina Aquilera in hideout added;)\n Euro Express crates and mail boxes\n New coke machines (Pepsi + Coca Cola)\nNew helicopters at airport\n New pager by CityGear\nNew crosshairs for rocket launcher and sniper rifle\nDefault ugly radar is now color and very detailed! Roads are white, buildings are orange, grass is green, water is blue and places of interest are purple.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n|RealGTA3 by Petr Doupal More Info at http://realgta.net |\n|                                                        |\n----------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0c7e94e79c883bb2e5257f20882af97e17e082c","amp;dn":"Grand+Theft+Auto+III%2BRealGTA3.Ready+to+Play.%28+New+Cars%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0c7e94e79c883bb2e5257f20882af97e17e082c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,199,233,78,121,200,131,187,46,82,87,242,8,130,175,151,225,126,8,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
