Because it also is reversed, if you live off the beaten track in a town of 20,or 30,000 he could appear just down the street from you.\n And he delivers. \n I swear if you are not looking at him perform you would swear it was Willie about 30 years ago.\n\n But opted for some good old fashion Rock n Roll.\n\nI urge anyone who gets a chance to go to the his show and see this talented performer.\nI have seen them 3 times and it does not get old, they are a breath of fresh air so to speak.\nThe only reason I am uploading this is they work there asses off and are constantly touring they really need to get some bigger venues to go along with  there home town rock image, but then again that is a big part of the attraction.\n\nLukas Nelson &amp; Promise of the Real - sometimes referred to as POTR - is an American rock group based out of California.  The band consists of Lukas Nelson (vocals/guitar), Anthony Logerfo (drums), Corey McCormick (bass), and Tato Melgar (percussion).
