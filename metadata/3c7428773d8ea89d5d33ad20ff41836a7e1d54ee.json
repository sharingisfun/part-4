Led Zeppelin will also open its vaults to share dozens of unheard studio and live recordings, with each album featuring a second disc of companion audio comprised entirely of unreleased music related to that album.\n\n&quot;The material on the companion discs presents a portal to the time of the recording of Led Zeppelin,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Page. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is a selection of work in progress with rough mixes, backing tracks, alternate versions, and new material recorded at the timeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nLed Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin II, and Led Zeppelin III will each be available June 3 from Atlantic/Swan Song in the following formats:\n\no Single CD Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Remastered album packaged in a gatefold card wallet.\n\no Deluxe Edition (2CD) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Remastered album, plus a second disc of unreleased companion audio.\n\no Single LP Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Remastered album on 180-gram vinyl, packaged in a sleeve that replicates the LPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first pressing in exacting detail.

From the opening salvo of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Good Times Bad Times,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ on through to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Babe IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Gonna Leave You,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Communication Breakdown,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dazed And Confused,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the album introduced the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unmistakable sound and left an indelible mark on the music landscape. Led Zeppelin has been certified diamond by the RIAA for sales over 10 million and was inducted into the GrammyÃ‚Â® Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\nThe companion audio for Led Zeppelin features a previously unreleased performance recorded on October 10, 1969 at the Olympia Theatre in Paris. The nine-song set features seven tracks from the album, including an epic 15-minute version of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dazed And Confused,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as well as Ã¢â‚¬Å“HeartbreakerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Moby Dick,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which would debut on Led Zeppelin II later that month.\n\nThe band wrote and recorded nearly all of Led Zeppelin II while touring relentlessly to support its debut album. Incredibly, the album was released just seven months after Led Zeppelin in October of 1969. Led Zeppelin II features some of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most beloved tracks including Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ramble OnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“HeartbreakerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as well as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Whole Lotta Love,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ considered by many to be one of the greatest rock Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll songs of all time. The album is certified diamond by the RIAA with sales of over 12 million copies.\n\nThe Led Zeppelin II companion audio gives fans the first peek into the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recording sessions, with alternate mixes of five songs from the album, backing tracks to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thank YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Living Loving Maid (SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Just A Woman),Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the previously unreleased track Ã¢â‚¬Å“La La.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nFollowing the whirlwind success of their first two albums and near constant touring, Page and Plant took to the now famous Bron-Yr-Aur cottage in Wales in 1970 to start the early composition of Led Zeppelin III. They later convened with Bonham and Jones for rehearsals before entering LondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Olympic Studios to begin recording in May 1970. Fueled by classic tracks such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Immigrant SongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Since IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Been Loving You,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the album soared to the top of charts worldwide upon its release in October of 1970 and has since been certified 6x platinum.\n\nThe nine tracks featured on Led Zeppelin IIIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s companion audio continue to offer a window into the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recording process with seven studio outtakes of songs from the album as well as three previously unheard compositions: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jennings Farm BluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (an instrumental forerunner of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bron-Yr-Aur StompÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bathroom SoundÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (an instrumental version of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Out On The TilesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), and their take on the blues classics Ã¢â‚¬Å“Keys To The Highway/Trouble In Mind.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nLed Zeppelin continues to be honored for its pivotal role in music history. The band was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005, and a year later was awarded with the Polar Music Prize in Stockholm. Founding members Jones, Page and Plant Ã¢â‚¬â€œ along with Jason Bonham, the son of John Bonham Ã¢â‚¬â€œ took the stage at LondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s O2 Arena in 2007 to headline a tribute concert for Ahmet Ertegun, a dear friend and Atlantic RecordsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ founder. The band was honored for its lifetime contribution to American culture at the Kennedy Center Honors in 2012. In January of 2014, the band won their first ever Grammy award as Celebration Day, which captured their live performance at the Ertegun tribute concert, was named Best Rock Album.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nLed Zeppelin\n\nDisc 1: Original Album Remastered\n\n1.
