Brilliant but autocratic, Debord helped both unify situationist praxis and destroy its expansion into areas not explicitly in line with his own ideas. His text The Society of the Spectacle remains today one of the great theoretical works on modern-day capital, cultural imperialism, and the role of mediation in social relationships.\n\nGuy Debord&amp;#039;s revolutionary 90 minute film took a year to make and incorporates footage from many famous films, Soviet and Polish films, industrial films, American Westerns, soft-core porn films, news footage, advertisements, and many still photographs. Events such as the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald (who assassinated U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1963), the revolutions in Spain in 1936, Hungary in 1956 and in Paris in 1968, and people such as Mao Tse Tung, Richard Nixon, and the Spanish Anarchist Durruti are represented. Throughout the movie, there is both a voiceover (of Debord) and inter-titles from &quot;Society of the Spectacle&quot; but also texts from the Committee of Occupation of the Sorbonne, Machiavelli, Marx, Tocqueville, Emile Pouget, and Soloviev. The innovative use of subtitles and intertitles is part of Debord?s goal ?to problematize reception? and force the viewer to be active. The spectacle, as Debord reminds us, &quot;is not a collection of images, but a relationship among people mediated by images.&quot;\n\nIncluced are the english and french texts of The Society of the Spectacle and the english text of Comments on The Society of the Spectacle.\n\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
