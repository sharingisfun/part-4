Lewin provides superbly clear and simple explanations of phenomena weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve always wondered about, such as why rainbows form and why lightning strikes, as well as those beyond the wildest realms of imagination, such as what the Big Bang sounded like. A wonderful raconteur, Lewin always entertains as he edifies, and For the Love of Physics is a rare gem that will change the way readers see the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11aa425081699e975e1f3c19df8f87068897e567","amp;dn":"For+the+Love+of+Physics%3A+From+the+End+of+the+Rainbow+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11aa425081699e975e1f3c19df8f87068897e567","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,170,66,80,129,105,158,151,94,31,60,25,223,143,135,6,136,151,229,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
