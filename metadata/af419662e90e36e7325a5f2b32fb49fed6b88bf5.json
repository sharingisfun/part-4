Meyers (Springer, 2012).pdf\r\n\r\nThe Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology (ESST) addresses the grand challenge for science and engineering today. It provides unprecedented, peer-reviewed coverage in more than 550 separate entries comprising 38 topical sections. ESST establishes a foundation for the many sustainability and policy evaluations being performed in institutions worldwide.\r\n\r\nAn indispensable resource for scientists and engineers in developing new technologies and for applying existing technologies to sustainability, the Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology is presented at the university and professional level needed for scientists, engineers, and their students to support real progress in sustainability science and technology.\r\n\r\nAlthough the emphasis is on science and technology rather than policy, the Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology is also a comprehensive and authoritative resource for policy makers who want to understand the scope of research and development and how these bottom-up innovations map on to the sustainability challenge","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af419662e90e36e7325a5f2b32fb49fed6b88bf5","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Sustainability+Science+and+Technology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af419662e90e36e7325a5f2b32fb49fed6b88bf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,65,150,98,233,14,54,231,50,90,95,43,50,251,73,254,214,184,139,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
