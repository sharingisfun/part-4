Along with the Velvet Underground and the Stooges, they were one of \n\nthe first bands in the early punk rock scene.[2] Their original line-up \n\nduring this time comprised vocalist David Johansen, guitarist Johnny \n\nThunders, bassist Arthur Kane, guitarist and pianist Sylvain Sylvain, and \n\ndrummer Jerry Nolan; the latter two had replaced Rick Rivets and Billy \n\nMurcia, respectively, in 1972.[3] According to the Encyclopedia of Popular \n\nMusic, the New York Dolls predated the punk and glam metal movements, and \n\nwere &quot;one of the most influential rock bands of the last 20 years&quot;.[3]\n\nAlthough their original line-up fell apart quickly, the band's first two \n\nalbumsÃ¢â‚¬â€New York Dolls (1973) and Too Much Too Soon (1974)Ã¢â‚¬â€became among the \n\nmost popular cult records in rock and roll.[1] The New York Dolls influenced \n\nbands such as the Sex Pistols, Kiss, the Ramones, Guns N' Roses, the Damned, \n\nand the Smiths, whose frontman Morrissey organized a reunion show for the \n\nband's surviving members in 2004.[4] After reuniting, they recorded and \n\nreleased three more albumsÃ¢â‚¬â€One Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This \n\n(2006), Cause I Sez So (2009), and Dancing Backward in High Heels (2011)...\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Dolls&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Dolls&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23c72eacc70e58ae6f68ee6ffec2856cdfcc4ecc","amp;dn":"New+York+Dolls+-+Studio+Discography+1973-2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23c72eacc70e58ae6f68ee6ffec2856cdfcc4ecc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,199,46,172,199,14,88,174,111,104,238,111,254,194,133,108,223,204,78,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
