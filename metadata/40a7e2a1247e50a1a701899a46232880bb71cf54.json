The Aqua Teens were originally billed as a detective crime fighting unit; however, the crime-solving aspect of the show was quickly abandoned. (In the third season, Frylock states: &quot;We haven't solved a mystery in three years!&quot;) There is little if any continuity between episodes; almost all recurring cast members have died at least once, only to return alive and well in the next episode. The focus is instead on a pervasive form of postmodern, surreal and often morbid humor, where the focus is often on dialogue and the characters' interrelation, to such a point where plot is often abandoned to allow more time for personal interaction.\nWIKI: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_teen_hunger_force\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0297494/\n\nCreators/Directors: Matt Maiellaro, Dave Willis.\nWriters: Matt Maiellaro, Dave Willis, Ted Murphy, Thom Nicolette.\nStarring: Dave Willis, Dana Snyder, Carey Means, C.

As you may have heard, they were arrested for placing electronic devices depicting Ignignokt, the Mooninite, flipping off passerbyers. The Boston police had suspected the devices of being bombs. After filing criminal charges, the city claimed to have been damaged to the tune of $1 million dollars. Perfect. According to RAINN, in the US, only 17% of accused rapists with sufficient evidence against them will ever spend a day in prison or jail -- but, I'm glad that instead of assisting in resolving that social problem, these cops took valuable time, money, and energy, and played in the subway looking for Light Bright sets. Way to go, pigs. Chalk up another victory for the state.]\n\n[Episode Guide Included.]\n\nThis torrent is a part of Operation: Massive Information Leak, Wave Two.\nBloodLogic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40a7e2a1247e50a1a701899a46232880bb71cf54","amp;dn":"Aqua+Teen+Hunger+Force+-+Seasons+1-5+%2B+Extras+%5BDVD-Rip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40a7e2a1247e50a1a701899a46232880bb71cf54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,167,226,161,36,126,80,161,167,1,137,154,70,35,40,128,187,113,207,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
