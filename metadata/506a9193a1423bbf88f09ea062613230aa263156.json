Bennie's discovery of his brother's near-finished play might hold the answer to understanding their shared past and renewing their bond.\n\nIMDb RATING: 7.2/10 (2,250 votes)\n\nSource ...: Retail R1 DVD\nRuntime ..: 02:07:02\nVideo ....: 640x272 (XviD @ 23.976fps)\nBitrate ..: ~630kbps\nAudio ....: MP3 ~128kbps\nLang .....: English / Spanish / French\nSubs .....: English / Spanish\n\nNOTES\nObviously the MENTiON release is not a real retail source like all their releases. p2p reencode most likely. If you are still not convinced then their release had no subs for the various non-english parts of the movie and also the 2CD split was incorrect causing a repeated short segment. samples included. The non-english part on this R1 are hardsubbed. Also we went for 1CD as it compressed very well even though it's long :)\n\nFinal note: Unlike previous one the retail R1 is presented in 1:2.35 and not 1:1.85\n\ncredit AMIABLE &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nUPLOAD DEDICATED TO redchaos2354, Motley Crue, jdpennington, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, xxxUniversalAbsurdityxxx, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld &amp; many, many more &amp; to all the awesome people who are sharing (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY)***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE even the CRITICIZERS :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:506a9193a1423bbf88f09ea062613230aa263156","amp;dn":"Tetro.2009.LIMITED.RETAIL.DVDRip.XviD-AMIABLE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"506a9193a1423bbf88f09ea062613230aa263156","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,106,145,147,161,66,59,191,136,240,158,160,98,97,50,48,170,38,49,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
