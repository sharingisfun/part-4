Two of the boys Pasquale, an orphan, and Giuseppe, his younger friend are riding. The pair have been saving to buy a horse of their own to ride... The boys meet Attilio, Giuse's much older brother, and his shady friend at a boat on the Tiber. In return for a commission, the boys agree to deliver black market goods to a fortune-teller. Once the woman has paid, Attilio's gang suddenly arrives. Pretending to be cops, they shake the woman down. With a payoff from Attilio, the boys are able to make the final payment and stable their horse in Trastevere over the river... The fortune-teller identifies Pasqua and Giuse. Held at an overcrowded boys' prison, they are separated. Giuse falls under the influence of an older lad in his cell, Arcangeli. During interrogation, Pasqua is tricked into betraying Giuse's brother to the police. With their trial still in the future, the two friends are driven further apart... \n\nRip Specs:\nFile Name .........................................: Sciuscia (1946) Vittorio De Sica.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,464,993,792 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:27:17\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD 1.1.0 Final\nFrame Size ......................................: 704x528 (AR: 1.333)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 2036 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.219 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038913/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038913/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nItalian audio; English subpack (idx/sub)\n\nRip of the MoC Series DVD, with all the extras included, posted originally at KG by wolferl, whom we thank","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc4336d9255d831e4707566cd69196e8f6ae4684","amp;dn":"Sciuscia+%281946%29+Vittorio+De+Sica","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc4336d9255d831e4707566cd69196e8f6ae4684","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,67,54,217,37,93,131,30,71,7,86,108,214,145,150,232,246,174,70,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
