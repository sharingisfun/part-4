Salman Rushdie wrote about him: &quot;One KapuÃ…â€ºciÃ…â€žski is worth more than a thousand whimpering and fantasizing scribblers.  His exceptional combination of journalism and art allows us to feel so close to what KapuÃ…â€ºciÃ…â€žski calls the inexpressible true image of war.&quot;\n\nANOTHER DAY OF LIFE (1976) is a record of three months of the Angolan Civil War.  THE EMPEROR (1978) is an astonishing analysis of the crumbling imperium of Haile Selassie, His Most Puissant Majesty and Distinguished Highness the Emperor of Ethiopia, who reigned from 1930 until he was overthrown by the army in 1974.  THE SOCCER WAR (1978) collects searing firsthand accounts of revolutions and coups in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East between 1958 and 1980.\n\nSHAH OF SHAHS (1982) is KapuÃ…â€ºciÃ…â€žski's analysis of the decline and fall of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran.  IMPERIUM (1993) bears witness to the disintegration of the Soviet Union, combining childhood memory with unblinking journalism, a radar for the truth with a keen appreciation of the absurd.  THE SHADOW OF THE SUN (2001) is a collection of essays about Africa spanning more than four decades.\n\nTRAVELS WITH HERODOTUS (2004) mixes together a collection of KapuÃ…â€ºciÃ…â€žski's own experiences and excerpts from the book The Histories by Herodotus which serves not only as a companion in his often long and lonely journeys but also as a guide to the conflicts waged in current times.\n\n\nThis enlarged version of my earlier KapuÃ…â€ºciÃ…â€žski torrent now includes 8 books in a mix of ePUB and PDF formats:\n\n* ANOTHER DAY OF LIFE (Knopf/Penguin, 2001).
