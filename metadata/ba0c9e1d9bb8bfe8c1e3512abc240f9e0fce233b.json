N. Behrmann's The Pirate on Broadway, there were no musical numbers whatsoever. But with Gene Kelly and Judy Garland in the leading roles of the 1948 filmization of The Pirate, the MGM production staff would have been drawn and quartered had there not been song after song. The story is merely serviceable: on a Caribbean isle in the early 19th century, sheltered young Garland  comes to believe that travelling troubadour Kelly  is in reality &quot;Mack the Black,&quot; a notorious pirate. Kelly  realizes that the surest way to win Garland's heart is to impersonate the romantic buccaneer, and this is what he does--nearly getting himself hanged in the process. Cole Porter's marvelous score yielded only one bona-fide hit: &quot;Be a Clown&quot;, which has practically nothing to do with the storyline, but do you care? Highlights include the magnificently staged &quot;Mack the Black,&quot; a heady combination of Broadway glitz and Caligariesque nightmare. Seven MGM screenwriters toiled away on The Pirate, though only the team of Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich were credited. While The Pirate was not a huge moneymaker on its first release, it has since been embraced by the cultists, who apparently can never get enough of Judy Garland. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040694/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040694/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSubs\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-29173&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-29173&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirector:\nVincente Minnelli\n\n        Judy Garland\t ... \tManuela\n\n\tGene Kelly\t... \tSerafin\n\tWalter Slezak\t... \tDon Pedro Vargas\n\tGladys Cooper\t... \tAunt Inez\n\tReginald Owen\t... \tThe Advocate\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:37:28\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 496x368  4:3\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1021 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,23 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba0c9e1d9bb8bfe8c1e3512abc240f9e0fce233b","amp;dn":"The+Pirate+%281948%29+Judy+Garland+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba0c9e1d9bb8bfe8c1e3512abc240f9e0fce233b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,12,158,29,155,184,191,232,193,227,81,42,188,36,15,158,15,206,35,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
