Through producer Gary Usher, the Rovells were introduced to the Beach Boys\\&amp;#039; Brian Wilson, who agreed to produce the group; rechristened the Honeys ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ a nickname for female surfers ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ they reeled off a series of outstanding Capitol singles including \\&quot;Shoot the Curl,\\&quot; \\&quot;Pray for Surf,\\&quot; and the Phil Spector homage \\&quot;The One You Can\\&amp;#039;t Have,\\&quot; none of which made any kind of commercial impact. A move to Warner Bros. preceded 1964\\&amp;#039;s superb \\&quot;He\\&amp;#039;s a Doll\\&quot;; on December 7 of that year, Brian Wilson and Marilyn Rovell were also married. Despite their continuing lack of chart success, the Honeys remained sought-after backing vocalists on sessions for the Beach Boys and Jan &amp; Dean; during the mid-\\&amp;#039;60s, the trio also recorded as Ginger &amp; the Snaps, although by the time of their 1969 swan song \\&quot;Goodnight My Love\\&quot; the Honeys name had been restored. When Blake left the group to pursue a solo career, Marilyn and Diane worked under the name American Spring; in 1983, the Honeys reunited for a disappointing comeback record, Ecstasy.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49590b6350a9b4259a3be994be0146166ecdbce8","amp;dn":"Brian+Wilson+-+The+Honeys+-+Capitol+Collectors+Series+RARE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49590b6350a9b4259a3be994be0146166ecdbce8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,89,11,99,80,169,180,37,154,59,233,148,190,1,70,22,110,205,188,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
