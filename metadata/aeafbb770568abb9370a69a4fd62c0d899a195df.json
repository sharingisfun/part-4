Originally a rebel leader, Josephus changed sides after he was captured to become a Rome-appointed negotiator, and so was uniquely placed to observe these turbulent events, from the siege of Jerusalem to the final heroic resistance and mass suicides at Masada.\r\n\r\nHis account provides much of what we know about the history of the Jews under Roman rule, with vivid portraits of such key figures as the Emperor Vespasian and Herod the Great. Often self-justifying and divided in its loyalties, The Jewish War nevertheless remains one of the most immediate accounts of war, its heroism and its horrors, ever written","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aeafbb770568abb9370a69a4fd62c0d899a195df","amp;dn":"The+Jewish+War+by+Josephus+%28Penguin+Classics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aeafbb770568abb9370a69a4fd62c0d899a195df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,175,187,119,5,104,171,185,55,10,105,164,253,98,192,216,153,161,149,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
