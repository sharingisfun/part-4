His work was key in the development of the theory of structuralism and structural anthropology.  He was honored by universities throughout the world and held the chair of Social Anthropology at the CollÃƒÂ¨ge de France (1959-1982), and was elected a member of the AcadÃƒÂ©mie franÃƒÂ§aise in 1973.\n\nHe argued that the &quot;savage&quot; mind had the same structures as the &quot;civilized&quot; mind and that human characteristics are the same everywhere.  These observations culminated in his famous book TRISTES TROPIQUES, which positioned him as one of the central figures in the structuralist school of thought, where his ideas reached into many fields in the humanities, as well as sociology and philosophy.\n\n\nAll the following books are in PDF format (STRUCTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY is also in ePUB):\n\n* INTRODUCTION TO THE WORK OF MARCEL MAUSS (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1987).
