They go on to discuss government bailouts, being bias, Hillaryâ€™s â€œhandler,â€ conspiracies regarding Hillary, Trumpâ€™s responses, and pneumonia.

They wrap chatting about Hillaryâ€™s body double, Osama bin Ladenâ€™s triplet, Ronald Reagan, unnecessary medication, ISIS, the simplicity of life back in the day, and do a touch (a bunch) more Hillary yapping into OT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:744d9f1a861716914ed49ba439bf872c6d0b965f","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2016-09-12","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"744d9f1a861716914ed49ba439bf872c6d0b965f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,77,159,26,134,23,22,145,78,212,155,164,57,191,135,44,109,11,150,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
