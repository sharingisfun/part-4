This beautiful and historic room, built by Queen Victoria in memory of her Prince Albert in 1871, now holds a special place for the band. As, indeed, does the venue hold the band in its heart Ã¯Â¿Â½ an image of The Killers is painted within its corridors in a graffiti installation alongside other previous artists to have famously played there, including The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Hendrix, Clapton, Sinatra and Pavarotti.\n\n'The Killers Ã¯Â¿Â½ Live From The Royal Albert Hall' features tracks from the bandÃ¯Â¿Â½s three studio albums, Hot Fuss (2004), SamÃ¯Â¿Â½s Town (2006) and Day &amp; Age (2008) - including huge hit singles Human, Spaceman, When You Were Young, Read My Mind, Mr Brightside, Somebody Told Me and All These Things That I've Done - as well as rarer tracks including a cover of Joy DivisionÃ¯Â¿Â½s Shadowplay and fan favourite Sweet Talk (from the 2007 collection of rarities, Sawdust)\n\n\n\nEnterlude \nHuman \nThis Is Your Life \nSomebody Told Me \nFor Reasons Unknown \nThe World We Live In \nJoy Ride \nI Can't Stay \nBling (Confession Of A King) \nShadowplay \nSmile Like You Mean It \nLosing Touch \nSpaceman \nA Dustland Fairytale \nSam's Town \nRead My Mind \nMr. Brightside \nAll These Things I've Done \nSweet Talk \nThis River Is Wild \nBones \nJenny Was A Friend Of Mine \nWhen You Were Young \nExitlude \nTranquilize [Live At Oxegen Festival] \nHuman [Live At Hyde Park] \nMr. Brightside \nSmile Like You Mean It [Live at V Festival] \nWhen You Were Young [Live at V Festival] \n\nFeel free to leave feedback\n\nPlease seed for others to enjoy.
