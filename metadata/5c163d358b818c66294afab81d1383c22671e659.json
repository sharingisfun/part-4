She has won 16 Juno Awards and seven Grammy Awards. Morissette began her career in Canada, and as a teenager recorded two dance-pop albums, Alanis and Now Is the Time, under MCA Records Canada. Her worldwide debut album was the rock-influenced Jagged Little Pill, which remains the best-selling debut album by a female artist in the U.S., and the highest selling debut album worldwide, selling more than 30 million units globally.[1] Her following album, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, was released in 1998 and was a success as well. Morissette took up producing duties for her subsequent albums, which include Under Rug Swept, So-Called Chaos and Flavors of Entanglement. Morissette has sold more than 40 million albums worldwide.[2][3]\n\nIn February 2005, Morissette became a naturalized citizen of the United States while maintaining her Canadian citizenship. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlanis 1991\n\nAlanis is the debut album by Alanis Morissette, released only in Canada in April 1991 by MCA Records Canada (see 1991 in music). Morissette recorded the album with Leslie Howe, who produced her second album Now Is the Time (1992), and it was certified platinum.\n\nJohn Alexander, head of A&amp;R for MCA Records Canada, first heard a demo tape from Morissette in 1983, when she was nine years old. He called it &quot;very promising. Her voice was very strong, and it was remarkable that the tape included some original songs written by her at that age.&quot; However, he decided not to sign her to a record deal because &quot;from an A&amp;R standpoint, I said, 'What am I going to do with a nine-year-old?'&quot;[3] In 1987 Morissette met entertainment manager Stephan Klovan, and at the 1988 World Figure Skating Championships she recorded a well-received version of &quot;O Canada&quot; with two musicians, one of whom was Leslie Howe of the new wave/synthpop duo One to One. Klovan intended for Howe to work with Morissette so that she could audition on the television show Star Search, but eventually both he and Howe decided to try to secure a record contract for her.\n\nOne of the demo recordings Howe and Morissette created with keyboardist Serge CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´tÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© in the studio was &quot;Walk Away&quot;, for which Howe and Klovan funded an expensive promotional video that was filmed in Paris, France.[4] In 1988 Howe sent the video to Alexander, who later arranged a dinner meeting with Morissette. &quot;I could tell that she was a very focused and passionate 14-year-old girl, who was also very talented&quot;, Alexander said. &quot;I felt strongly that we could work together to build her music career.&quot;[3] The next day he met Morissette and her parents and told them he wanted to sign her, but MCA Records did not endorse this decision. Leeds Levy, president of MCA Publishing in North America, thought that Morissette had talent and agreed to sign her to a publishing deal as well as help fund a record deal for her. MCA Publishing financed the album through Hot Mustard Records, its new independent label for the development of new artists, and MCA Records distributed it.[3] The album was recorded in Distortion Studios, Ottawa between September and December 1990.[5]\n\nAccording to Morissette, people from MCA placed &quot;hardcore&quot; pressure on her to lose weight in time for the album's release, leading her to develop anorexia nervosa and bulimia. She recalled returning to the studio to re-record some vocals, only to be told &quot;I actually wanted to talk to you about your weight. You can't be successful if you're fat.&quot; During this period, she lived on a diet of carrots, black coffee and Melba toast, and her weight fluctuated between 15 and 20 pounds. She subsequently began therapy, which she called &quot;a long process to un-program [my brain]. I try to remember, whatever my body is, it's perfect the way it is.&quot;\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Feel Your Love&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Too Hot&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Plastic&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Walk Away&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;On My Own&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Superman&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Jealous&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Human Touch&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Oh Yeah!&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Party Boy&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Is The Time 1992\n\nNow Is the Time is the second album by Alanis Morissette, released only in Canada in August 1992 by MCA Records Canada (see 1992 in music). Morissette recorded the album with Leslie Howe, who produced her debut album Alanis (1991).\n\nIn 1995 Morissette released her international debut album Jagged Little Pill through U.S. label Maverick Records. Executives at Maverick persuaded MCA Records to withdraw all copies of Alanis and Now Is the Time from circulation, and they did not mention either album in the promotional material for Jagged Little Pill.[2] According to Spin magazine, Morissette's transformation from &quot;the Debbie Gibson of Canada&quot; to an alternative rock musician made some Canadians skeptical.[3] As with Alanis, Now Is the Time is no longer available, as it has been discontinued. Morissette's contract with MCA expired after the release of the album, and she said &quot;It was kind of a blessing that it was over, because I wanted to start out with a clean slate, not only personally but career-wise, too.&quot;[3] Time magazine called the album &quot;uninspired&quot;, and the song &quot;Rain&quot; &quot;wistful&quot;,[4] while The Kansas City Star labelled it &quot;a lightweight faux Madonna album&quot;.[5]\n\nMorissette said of Alanis and Now Is the Time, &quot;...I'm not scared people might hear these records. I never did Playboy centerfolds. There's nothing I regret. Maybe people will just understand that my lyrics are from different experiences if they hear those records. It validates [Jagged Little Pill] ... There was an element of me not being who I really was at the time and now i'm more experienced with my life. It was because I wasn't prepared to open up that way. The focus for me then was entertaining people and getting my feet wet in the business,it was about being young &amp; having fun as opposed to sharing any revelations I had at the time. I had them, but I wasn't prepared or comfortable with sharing them.&quot;[citation needed]\n\nShe considered including material from both albums on her 2005 compilation The Collection, but she was talked out of it and decided against it citing the genres dance/pop wouldn't match other material from her current discography, explaining &quot;[6] &quot;it was right around when I was 19 and Jagged Little Pill where I first felt writing was a channeled experience. That has a lot to do with where I was at then, with having met Glen Ballard, with my moving from Canada and moving away from any preconceived notions of how songs 'should' be written. It was the beginning of a new way to approach songwriting altogether.&quot;[7] All songs written and composed by Alanis, Leslie David Howe and Serge CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´tÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©. \n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Real World&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;An Emotion Away&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Rain&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;The Time of Your Life&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;No Apologies&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Can't Deny&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;When We Meet Again&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Give What You Got&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;(Change Is) Never a Waste of Time&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Big Bad Love&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJagged Little Pill 1995\n\n\nJagged Little Pill is the third studio album (and the first to be released internationally) by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette. The album marked a shift in style and genre for Morissette from her previous dance pop sound. As detailed in the article about the seventh track, &quot;You Learn&quot;, the title is a metaphor for lessons of life that are hard to accept. The album was Morissette's breakthrough album, and contained six hits, &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, &quot;Ironic&quot;, &quot;You Learn&quot;, &quot;Hand in My Pocket&quot;, &quot;Head over Feet&quot;, and &quot;All I Really Want&quot;.\n\nThe album spent twelve non-consecutive weeks at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart. By 2009, the album had sold 33 million units worldwide.[2]. Additionally it was ranked by the Billboard 200 as the number one selling album of the 1990s.[3]\n\nIn October 2002, Rolling Stone ranked it number 31 on its Women In Rock - The 50 Essential Albums list, and in 2003 the magazine ranked it number 327 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[4] The album also holds a title in The Definitive 200 Albums list, in which it is placed at number 26.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;All I Really Want&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:44\n2.\t&quot;You Oughta Know&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09\n3.\t&quot;Perfect&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:07\n4.\t&quot;Hand in My Pocket&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:41\n5.\t&quot;Right Through You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:55\n6.\t&quot;Forgiven&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:00\n7.\t&quot;You Learn&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59\n8.\t&quot;Head over Feet&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27\n9.\t&quot;Mary Jane&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:40\n10.\t&quot;Ironic&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n11.\t&quot;Not the Doctor&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n12.\t&quot;Wake Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:53\n13.\t &quot;You Oughta Know (Hidden)\n\nSome CDs contain a hidden track with two extra songs. Track 13 contains another version of &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; with a heavier bass guitar (a remix by Jimmy Boyelle called &quot;The Jimmy the Saint Blend&quot;), followed by a length of silence, then an a cappella recording of &quot;Your House&quot; plays 5:12 into the track. Some CDs include only &quot;Your House&quot; as a bonus track. The original issue of the cassette contained both songs, also as the 13th track. The vinyl releases contained 3 seconds of &quot;The Jimmy the Saint Blend&quot; of &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; and fade out after the opening lyrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupposed Former Infatuation Junkie 1998\n\n\n\nSupposed Former Infatuation Junkie is the fourth album and second internationally released album by singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, released by Maverick Records in the United States on November 3, 1998.\n\n\nAfter the massive success of Jagged Little Pill (1995), Morissette was considered one of the biggest music stars in the world, and many fans anxiously awaited a follow-up album. A dark and wandering album, the mystery of Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie began on its cover, with a shot of Alanis' laughing and the following text printed over that image that refers to The Eight Precepts of Buddhism.\n\nThe album was also an unusual project because it featured many songs with no hooks or choruses, confounding people who heard it. Songs such as &quot;Front Row&quot;, &quot;The Couch&quot;, and &quot;I Was Hoping&quot; challenged the traditional song formula.[citation needed]\nMorissette wrote &quot;Thank U&quot; and &quot;Baba&quot; after her trip to India. The protagonist of &quot;Baba&quot; goes on a spiritual pilgrimage to India where she encounters a guru who, like many spiritual teachers in India, is referred to as &quot;Baba&quot;. The word &quot;Baba&quot; means &quot;father&quot; in the Hindi language. Morissette opened most of shows during the Junkie era with the song, and it was featured as an opener during her 2002 tours. It has been seldom played since then. &quot;Baba&quot; opened Morissette's performance on the television show MTV Unplugged in 1999, but it was excluded from the CD release Alanis Unplugged. Another live version of &quot;Baba&quot; was released on the No Boundaries: A Benefit for the Kosovar Refugees CD.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Front Row&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n2.\t&quot;Baba&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30\n3.\t&quot;Thank U&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:19\n4.\t&quot;Are You Still Mad&quot; (Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04\n5.\t&quot;Sympathetic Character&quot; (Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:13\n6.\t&quot;That I Would Be Good&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18\n7.\t&quot;The Couch&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:24\n8.\t&quot;Can't Not&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n9.\t&quot;UR&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n10.\t&quot;I Was Hoping&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51\n11.\t&quot;One&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:41\n12.\t&quot;Would Not Come&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:06\n13.\t&quot;Unsent&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:10\n14.\t&quot;So Pure&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:51\n15.\t&quot;Joining You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:24\n16.\t&quot;Heart of the House&quot; (Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n17.\t&quot;Your Congratulations&quot; (Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMTV Unplugged 1999\n\n\nMTV Unplugged is the fifth album and first live album by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, released by Maverick Records in the United States on November 9, 1999 (see 1999 in music). It comprises songs performed by Morissette on the television program MTV Unplugged. Twelve tracks were included on the album, but Morissette performed several others, including &quot;Baba&quot;, &quot;Thank U&quot; (both from 1998's Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie) and &quot;Your House&quot; (the hidden track on 1995's Jagged Little Pill), during her Unplugged concert. The first single, &quot;That I Would Be Good&quot;, was moderately successful, and two other tracks, &quot;King of Pain&quot; (a cover of the song by The Police) and &quot;You Learn&quot; were released as singles outside North America. As of September 2008 the album has sold 646,000 copies in the U.S.[1]\n\nIn addition to material from Morissette's first two U.S. albums, MTV Unplugged featured performances of three previously unreleased songs from her tours: &quot;No Pressure over Cappuccino&quot;, &quot;Princes Familiar&quot; and &quot;These R the Thoughts&quot;. Morissette has stated that &quot;Princes Familiar&quot; in particular is one of her favourite and most vocally challenging songs. She performed it on her 2005 Diamond Wink Tour, where she dedicated it to &quot;all of the Dads in the audience&quot;. The ballad &quot;No Pressure over Cappuccino&quot;, one of the first songs she wrote following the release of Jagged Little Pill, is presumably about the singer's twin brother, Wade.[citation needed]\n\nFeaturing cleaner vocals, slower arrangements and a few drastic reinventions (particularly in the case of &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;), Alanis Unplugged foreshadowed much of Morissette's later, softer work, particularly 2005's Jagged Little Pill Acoustic and the accompanying Diamond Wink Tour.\n\nMTV Unplugged is Alanis's best-selling album in Brazil.\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;You Learn&quot; (Glen Ballard, Alanis Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:21\n2.\t&quot;Joining You&quot; (Ballard, Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:09\n3.\t&quot;No Pressure over Cappuccino&quot; (Nick Lashley, Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“4:41\n4.\t&quot;That I Would Be Good&quot; (Ballard, Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n5.\t&quot;Head over Feet&quot; (Ballard, Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22\n6.\t&quot;Princes Familiar&quot; (Ballard, Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37\n7.\t&quot;I Was Hoping&quot; (Ballard, Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:53\n8.\t&quot;Ironic&quot; (Ballard, Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:13\n9.\t&quot;These R the Thoughts&quot; (Ballard, Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n10.\t&quot;King of Pain&quot; (The Police) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05\n11.\t&quot;You Oughta Know&quot; (Ballard, Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:01\n12.\t&quot;Uninvited&quot; (Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Rug Swept 2002\n\n\nUnder Rug Swept is the fifth album by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette. Released by Maverick Records in the United States on February 26, 2002 and in the United Kingdom a day earlier (see 2002 in music), it was the first album Morissette had written and produced on her own. It debuted at number one on charts in twelve countries, including Canada, and produced the singles &quot;Hands Clean&quot; and &quot;Precious Illusions&quot;. Sales, however, did not match those of Morissette's previous two studio albums.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;21 Things I Want in a Lover&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:28\n2.\t&quot;Narcissus&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:38\n3.\t&quot;Hands Clean&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:32\n4.\t&quot;Flinch&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:03\n5.\t&quot;So Unsexy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:09\n6.\t&quot;Precious Illusions&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:11\n7.\t&quot;That Particular Time&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22\n8.\t&quot;A Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34\n9.\t&quot;You Owe Me Nothing in Return&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:58\n10.\t&quot;Surrendering&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35\n11.\t&quot;Utopia&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo Called - Chaos 2004\n\n\nSo-Called Chaos is the sixth studio album (fourth released internationally) by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, released in May 2004.\n\nIt had been two years since Morissette released her fifth studio album, Under Rug Swept. In that time she had met her fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Ryan Reynolds, so her cheery disposition made its presence felt in many of the songs she wrote for So-Called Chaos. The album found her in a more contented and relaxed state than ever, and her songs were brighter and happier than her more volatile works like &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; and &quot;Uninvited&quot;. One reporter asked if the song &quot;This Grudge&quot; was based on the same person as &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, and Morissette replied, &quot;Different person, same era.&quot;[2]\n\nThe first single, &quot;Everything&quot;, was released to U.S. radio in the spring of 2004, and was met with mixed reaction. U.S. Adult Top 40 radio stations gave the song good airplay, but mainstream and top 40 stations were colder in their reception, and consequently it became Morissette's lowest peaking single on the Billboard Hot 100. &quot;Everything&quot; was included on the Totally Hits 2004, Vol. 2 compilation, and in 2006 it was featured in the film Clerks II.\n\nSome reviews of So-Called Chaos were positive, with many critics calling it her most accessible and mainstream record since her landmark debut Jagged Little Pill (1995). Still, others thought she had &quot;sold out&quot; for the sake of sales and radio play; Rolling Stone magazine, for example, said the album &quot;attempts to reverse the sliding record sales following [Jagged Little Pill].&quot;[3]\n\nThe album debuted at number two on the Canadian albums chart with first week sales of 11,200,[4] and at number five on the U.S. Billboard 200, selling 115,000 copies in its first week in the U.S. and 887,000 that same week worldwide.[5] It spent a week in the U.S. top ten before falling down the chart. As of September 2008 it has sold 470,000 copies in the U.S.[6] The second single outside the U.S. was &quot;Out Is Through&quot;, which had a poor showing in the UK. The second U.S. single was &quot;Eight Easy Steps&quot;, which, despite being accompanied by an elaborate music video,[7] failed to chart on the Hot 100 or cause a significant increase in sales of the album, which had already fallen off the Billboard 200. &quot;Excuses&quot; was released as a radio single in Brazil, where it peaked outside the top forty.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Eight Easy Steps&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:52\n2.\t&quot;Out Is Through&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52\n3.\t&quot;Excuses&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32\n4.\t&quot;Doth I Protest Too Much&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03\n5.\t&quot;Knees of My Bees&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:41\n6.\t&quot;So-Called Chaos&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:03\n7.\t&quot;Not All Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58\n8.\t&quot;This Grudge&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:07\n9.\t&quot;Spineless&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15\n10.\t&quot;Everything&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJagged Little Pill Acoustic 2005\n\nJagged Little Pill Acoustic is Alanis Morissette's compilation album and is, as the title indicates, an acoustic version of her album Jagged Little Pill (1995), released by Maverick Records in the United States on June 13, 2005 (see 2005 in music). It was only available at North American Starbucks outlets until 26 July 2005, when it was made available in other retail stores. This limited availability led to a dispute between Maverick Records and HMV Canada, who retaliated by removing from sale Morissette's other albums for the duration of Starbucks' exclusive month-long sale. The album's single in the U.S. was &quot;Hand in My Pocket&quot;. The artwork of cover is a tribute to the cover of the original Jagged Little Pill.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;All I Really Want&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;You Oughta Know&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Perfect&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Hand in My Pocket&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Right Through You&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Forgiven&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;You Learn&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Head over Feet&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Mary Jane&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Ironic&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Not the Doctor&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Wake Up&quot; / &quot;Your House&quot; (hidden track)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Collection 2005\n\n\nAlanis Morissette: The Collection is the greatest hits compilation album by Alanis Morissette, released in the United States on 15 November 2005.
