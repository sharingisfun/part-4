Raw, rowdy, and often surprisingly intimate, the debut album from Charleston, South Carolina-based duo Shovels and Rope shoves early country, bluegrass, and blues through an indie rock prism, resulting in a set of fiery, beer bottle-littered back-porch jams that blend the wily harmonies of Johnny and June with the lo-fi clang of Jack White.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89e75433cb55589f9ab89d1e6e75f1a3e8dd0a92","amp;dn":"Shovels+and+Rope+-+O+Be+Joyful+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89e75433cb55589f9ab89d1e6e75f1a3e8dd0a92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,231,84,51,203,85,88,159,154,184,157,30,110,117,241,163,232,221,10,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
