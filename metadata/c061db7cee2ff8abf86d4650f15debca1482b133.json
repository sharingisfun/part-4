This release is playable with VLC player as well as Media Player Classic, Windows Media Player, Playstation 3, and any other devices capable of playing 720p HD MP4 video files with Dolby Digital AC3 5.1 channel surround audio.\n\nIf you want this show in MKV format it is easy to convert it from MP4 to MKV using MKVtoolnix 2.2.0 (MKVmerge 2.2.0) which you can download from here  httpwww.bunkus.orgvideotoolsmkvtoolnixwin32mkvtoolnix-2.2.0-setup.exe\n\nHere's how to do it  Download and install MKVMerge (Use link above). It is a free program that allows you to take video and audio files and convert them into MKV files on the fly, making it a very quick conversion.\n\nOpen MKVMerge on your computer, and you will be greeted by its home menu. Click the Add button that is near the top of the program, and a new window will appear giving you access to your computer's files. Locate your MP4 video files and select them. Press Open, and it will load into MKVMerge.\n\nPress the Browse button at the bottom of the program, and a window will appear. Locate a place on your computer to save the new MKV file after it is created. Once you have found a place, click Save to save the location. Click the Start Muxing button at the bottom of the program and your MKV file will be created. Depending on the size of the file, it could take a few minutes. Once it is finished locate the MKV file after the program congratulates you on the conversion and play it as you would any other video file.\n\nTo ensure that you can get proper MKV playback after the mkv conversion be sure you have installed the K-lite codec pack full version or mega version both of which comes with Media Player Classic Home Cinema and configure it properly for .mkv playback. If you do not have it you can get it here below \n\nhttpwww.free-codecs.comdownloadK_Lite_Codec_Pack.htm \n\nOnce installed you can playback the .mkv file with the following players\n\nMedia Player Classic or Windows Media Player. \n\nVLC player doesn't play the MKV video only the audio for some unknown reason, so use the above players or you can burn the .mkv video file to a DVD -R disc or load it onto a USB flash drive and play it back on any BluRay player that is MKV compatible and has a USB port like my Panasonic DMP BD75 BluRay player and LG BP-620 3D BluRay player does.\n \nEnjoy the show Justified fans and thanks for downloading my Justified S06E13 The Promise 720p AVCHD-SC-SDH release.\n\nUploaded by SCSA420 on KickAss Torrents\n\n\nStoneCold420 \nSmackDownHotel\nApril 14, 2015\n\n\nFor SDH releases from 2012-03-29 onward please go here  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/SCSA420&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/SCSA420&lt;/a&gt;  or go here","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c061db7cee2ff8abf86d4650f15debca1482b133","amp;dn":"Justified+S06E13+The+Promise+720p+AVCHD-SC-SDH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c061db7cee2ff8abf86d4650f15debca1482b133","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,97,219,124,238,47,248,171,248,109,70,80,241,93,235,202,20,130,177,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
