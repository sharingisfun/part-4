It offers unparalleled performance and supports the widest breadth of devices and platforms. It is ideally suited to environments with strict, real-time constraints like kernel-mode and in particular to embedded systems programming. Whether you plan on learning C as a foundation for C++ or to prepare yourself for embedded programming, this course will give you a solid foundation and show you that C need not be feared.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01a8f70020dcc1dbcf95ab3cc8a63f9270b2234f","amp;dn":"PluralSight+-+C+Programming+Language+Fundamentals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01a8f70020dcc1dbcf95ab3cc8a63f9270b2234f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,168,247,0,32,220,193,219,207,149,171,60,200,166,63,146,112,178,35,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
