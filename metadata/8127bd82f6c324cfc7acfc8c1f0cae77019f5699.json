Their highly retro style of music was influenced by rock bands like Led Zeppelin, Queen, AC/DC, Guns N' Roses, Aerosmith, Sparks, Van Halen, T. Rex, Def Leppard, Whitesnake and Thin Lizzy. They were best known for the soaring falsetto of their lead singer Justin Hawkins, whose departure in 2006 resulted in the dissolution of the band.\n\nPermission to Land is the debut album of The Darkness. It was released on July 7, 2003 and became an almost-instant success, reaching No. 1 in the UK album charts as well as five platinum certifications in the UK alone.\n\nAlongside its strong commercial success, Permission to Land also received highly positive reviews from critics.
