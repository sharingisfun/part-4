From Malaysia to Southwest China, Vietnam to Cambodia and Thailand this vast area includes outstanding landscapes, historic cities, tropical jungles and armies of animals. With mangroves and mountains, pygmy elephants, turtles and rare birds it is no wonder that the word 'mega-diverse' is now attributed to parts of the region.\nSouth-west of China and east of India lies the Asian peninsula Indochina, which is home to some of the most breath-taking natural wonders. WILDEST INDOCHINA journeys through this exotic location starting with Malaysia which encompasses the giant island of Borneo - the land of majestically languid orang-utans and saltwater crocodiles, then travels North to Thailand which is where the heart of Indochina lies, home to diverse species such as long tailed macaques who survive in this land of extreme geography. Next up is Cambodia which dumbfounds many with its water kingdom and as a result is stricken annually by a huge monsoon; Asian elephants and the Burmese python inhabit this mystical location. See how life has fought back in war-ravaged Vietnam, which contains 10% of the world's species, within a south-eastern Himalayan enclave lies China's secret garden, where half of all Chinese birds and mammals exist.\n\n\n1)  Malaysia Freaks of Nature \nThe diversity of Malaysia is unparalled, especially on the third largest island in the world, Borneo, where orang-utans swing through the trees and giant saltwater crocs lurk.\n\n2)  Thailand Natures Survivors \nThe heart of Indochina belongs to Thailand, where diverse species such as tigers and long-tailed macaques survive in this land of extreme geography, and the mega-diverse Malaysia encompasses the giant island of Borneo, the land of majestically languid orang-utans and giant saltwater crocodiles.\n\n3)  Cambodia the Water Kingdom \nExplore Cambodia, one of the most bio-diverse countries in Southeast Asia, whose wildlife and climate is ruled by the impact of the annual monsoon cycle.\n\n4)  Vietnam Phoenix from the Ashes \nVietnam is the easternmost country on the Indochina peninsula in Southeast Asia, and around 10% of the world's species live here causing its jungles to burst with wildlife.\n\n5)  Chinas Secret Garden \nAround half of China's birds and mammals live in a tiny region in China's southwest corner. Explore this land of snowcapped mountains, temperate valleys and tropical jungles\n \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5f173638371f136b716e&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 3172 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 45mins\n * Framerate: 25 FPS\n * Number of Parts: 5\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: average 998 MB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.offthefence.com/detail/wildest-indochina/2295347/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.offthefence.com/detail/wildest-indochina/2295347/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ce864f661334edc1a6ef9e8d7631257033ca94c","amp;dn":"Wildest+Indochina+5of5+Chinas+Secret+Garden+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ce864f661334edc1a6ef9e8d7631257033ca94c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,232,100,246,97,51,78,220,26,110,249,232,215,99,18,87,3,60,169,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
