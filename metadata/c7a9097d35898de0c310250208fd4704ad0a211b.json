It comes at the culmination of a year in which Coltrane arguably reached his creative peak, recording sessions like &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;, &quot;Meditations&quot;, and &quot;Ascension&quot;. \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Complete Sun Ship SessionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is sourced from newly discovered original reels, the set includes the album's five original compositions, unedited, in sequence of recording, with all of the takes as they evolved, as well as the surrounding conversations. More than just a sampling of a few alternate takes, the Complete Session offers a rare opportunity to listen to an iconic master at work.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Sun ShipÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a key moment of transition, of personal as well as musical transformation. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a treasure, a joy, and a revelation. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one of ColtraneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most powerful albums.\n\n\nJohn Coltrane\n\nThe Complete Sun Ship Session\n\n2013\n\n\n  2 CDs / 2013 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist / Disc 1:\n\n1.
