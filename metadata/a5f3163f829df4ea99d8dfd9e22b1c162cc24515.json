At least one episode each season has featured Spurlock as the person spending the month in the particular lifestyle.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5f3163f829df4ea99d8dfd9e22b1c162cc24515","amp;dn":"30+Days++%28Morgan+Spurlock+-+All+3+Seasons%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5f3163f829df4ea99d8dfd9e22b1c162cc24515","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,243,22,63,130,157,244,234,153,216,223,217,226,43,28,22,44,194,69,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
