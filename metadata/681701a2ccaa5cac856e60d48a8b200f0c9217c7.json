The band released only two albums during its first seven years, and finally found mainstream success with a self-titled release in 1996. It proved to be Sublime's last proper album, however, as lead singer Brad Nowell died in May 1996, just two months before the record's release. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tAlternative\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Date Rape\n02.Smoke Two Joints\n03.Badfish\n04.Greatest Hits\n05.Saw Red\n06.What I Got\n07.Santeria\n08.Wrong Way\n09.Doin' Time\n10.April 29, 1992 (Miami)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:681701a2ccaa5cac856e60d48a8b200f0c9217c7","amp;dn":"Sublime+-+20th+Century+Masters+Best+Of+Sublime+%282002%29+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"681701a2ccaa5cac856e60d48a8b200f0c9217c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,23,1,162,204,170,92,172,133,110,96,212,138,139,32,15,12,146,23,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
