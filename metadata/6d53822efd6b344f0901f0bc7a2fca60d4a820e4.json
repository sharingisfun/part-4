Translated by Damion Searls, with an Introduction by Ralph Freedman and Foreword by James Franco.\n\nISBN: 978-0143106784 | 176 pages | ePUB + MOBI\n\n\nDEMIAN (1919) is the beloved and influential coming-of-age novel by Hermann Hesse (1877-1962) in a powerful new translation by Damion Searls and -- for those who care -- with a personal foreword and cover art by James Franco.\n\nIn the novel, a young man, Emil Sinclair, awakens to selfhood and to a world of possibilities beyond the conventions of his upbringing.  Sinclair is a quiet boy drawn into a forbidden yet seductive realm of petty crime and defiance.  His guide is his precocious, mysterious classmate Max Demian, who provokes in Emil a search for self-discovery and spiritual fulfillment.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n               &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
