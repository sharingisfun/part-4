His memory is blank. But heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not alone. When the liftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doors open, Thomas finds himself surrounded by kids who welcome him to the GladeÃ¢â‚¬â€a large, open expanse surrounded by stone walls. Just like Thomas, the Gladers donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know why or how they got to the Glade. All they know is that every morning the stone doors to the maze that surrounds them have opened. Every night theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve closed tight. And every 30 days a new boy has been delivered in the lift. Thomas was expected. But the next day, a girl is sent upÃ¢â‚¬â€the first girl to ever arrive in the Glade. And more surprising yet is the message she delivers. Thomas might be more important than he could ever guess. If only he could unlock the dark secrets buried within his mind.\n\n--\n\nI don't know if this abridged, just fetched it over the net.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44ce1a2c54e7ad440d220e3e4a20b4eb0649f4bb","amp;dn":"The+Maze+Runner+-+James+Dashner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44ce1a2c54e7ad440d220e3e4a20b4eb0649f4bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,206,26,44,84,231,173,68,13,34,14,62,74,32,180,235,6,73,244,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
