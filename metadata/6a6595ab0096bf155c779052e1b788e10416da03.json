New design methods required for powering small, high-performance electronic devices are presented. Based on the authors' decades of experience, the book is filled with real-world solutions and many nomograms, and features simplified theory and mathematical analysis.\n\nThis comprehensive volume explains common requirements for direct operation from the AC line supply and discusses design, theory, and practice. Engineering requirements of switchmode systems and recommendations for active power factor correction are included. This practical guide provides you with a working knowledge of the latest topologies along with step-by-step approaches to component decisions to achieve reliable and cost-effective power supply designs.\n\nSwitchmode Power Supply Handbook, third edition covers:\n\n    * Functional requirements of direct off-line switchmode power supplies\n    * Power components selection and transformer designs for converter circuits\n    * Transformer, choke, and thermal design\n    * Input filters, RFI control, snubber circuits, and auxiliary systems\n    * Active power factor correction system design\n    * Worked examples of would components\n    * Examples of fully resonant and quasi-resonant systems\n    * A resonant inverter fluorescent ballast\n    * An example of high-power phase shift modulated system\n    * A new MOSFET resonant inverter drive scheme\n    * A single-control, wide-range wave oscillator\n\nFrom the Back Cover\nThe bestselling reference--packed with essential new material! The leading hands-on guide in this rapidly expanding area of electronics, Keith Billing's revision of the Switchmode Power Supply Handbook brings additional state-of-the-art techniques and developments to engineers at all levels. Offering sound working knowledge of the latest in topologies and clear, step-by-step approaches to component decisions, this handbook gives power supply designers practical, solutions-oriented design guidance, free of unnecessarily complicated mathematical derivations and theory. The Handbook features many new fully worked examples, as well as numerous nomograms--everything you need to design today's smaller, faster, and cooler systems. Turn to the new Part 4, and you'll find cutting-edge design expertise on: electronic ballast; power factor correction. In addition, the previously updated parts 1-3 still provide fully applicable sections on: thermal management techniques; transformers, chokes, input filters, EMI control, converters, snubber circuits, auxiliary systems, and much more. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 832 pages\n    * Publisher: McGraw-Hill Professional; 3 edition (September 21, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0071639713\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0071639712","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a6595ab0096bf155c779052e1b788e10416da03","amp;dn":"Switchmode+Power+Supply+Handbook+3rd+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a6595ab0096bf155c779052e1b788e10416da03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,101,149,171,0,150,191,21,92,119,144,82,225,183,136,225,4,22,218,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
