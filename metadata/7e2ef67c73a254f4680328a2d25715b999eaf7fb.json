In this workshop, professional developer Edward Tanguay shows you how to use these features and introduces you to a number of new, useful functions such as array_replace, date_add, new functions to work with ini files, and more. In addition to these new features of PHP, youÃ‚Â´ll also learn the basics of using cookies and regular expressions. \n\n\nInfo: https://www.video2brain.com/en/courses/professional-php-volume-2\n\n\n Please SEED after you download so I get free to upload the next release.
