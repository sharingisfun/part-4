The first set, consisting of two discs, titled Volume I and Volume II, was released in 1985. The second, single disc titled Volume III was released in 1997. All songs but the last three on Volume III, &quot;To Make You Feel My Love&quot;, &quot;Hey Girl&quot; and &quot;Light as the Breeze&quot; were written by Joel. &quot;You're Only Human (Second Wind)&quot; and &quot;The Night Is Still Young&quot; are only available on the first set. The other songs appear mostly in order of their release dates and generally represent Joel's most successful singles.  Greatest Hits Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Volume I &amp; Volume II has been certified double diamond by the RIAA, selling over 11.5 million copies (23 million units) and is tied with Pink Floyd's The Wall and Led Zeppelin's Led Zeppelin IV for third most certified album of all time in the U.S.[2]  The Greatest Hits Volume I &amp; Volume II album includes hits from 1973 to 1985 in chronological order with one exception. The album includes two previously unreleased tracks, &quot;You're Only Human (Second Wind)&quot; and &quot;The Night Is Still Young&quot; (this track exclusive to this collection, and repackaged variants, whereas &quot;You're Only Human&quot; later featured on the compilation The Ultimate Collection released in 2000). Some pressings do not include &quot;Honesty&quot; as the last song on side 2, and instead include &quot;Don't Ask Me Why&quot; as the third song on side 3.\nThe Greatest Hits Volume III album includes hits from 1983 to 1997. Three previously unreleased studio tracks are included, &quot;To Make You Feel My Love&quot;, &quot;Hey Girl&quot;, and &quot;Light as the Breeze&quot;. All three tracks are covers songs (a rare occurrence in his catalogue), and although &quot;To Make You Feel My Love&quot; and &quot;Hey Girl&quot; were recorded to be singles for this album, Joel originally recorded the song &quot;Light as the Breeze&quot; for a Leonard Cohen tribute album, Tower of Song, released in 1995.  Chronologically, Greatest Hits Volume III overlaps slightly with Volume II, as the first two tracks, &quot;Keeping the Faith&quot; and &quot;An Innocent Man&quot;, first appeared on his album An Innocent Man.\n\n \n\nVolume I CD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Piano Man\n[02] Captain Jack\n[03] The Entertainer\n[04] Say Goodbye To Hollywood\n[05] New York State Of Mind\n[06] The Stranger\n[07] Scenes From An Italian Restaurant\n[08] Just The Way You Are\n[09] Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)\n[10] Only The Good Die Young\n[11] She's Always A Woman\n\nPlay Time - 00h:53m:19s\n\nVolume II CD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] My Life\n[02] Big Shot\n[03] You May Be Right\n[04] It's Still Rock And Roll To Me\n[05] Don't Ask Me Why\n[06] She's Got A Way\n[07] Pressure\n[08] Allentown\n[09] Goodnight Saigon\n[10] Tell Her About It\n[11] Uptown Girl\n[12] The Longest Time\n[13] You're Only Human (Second Wind)\n[14] The Night Is Still Young\n\nPlay Time - 00h:56m:21s\n\n\n\nVolume III CD03 Track Listings\n\n[01] Keeping The Faith\n[02] An Innocent Man\n[03] A Matter Of Trust\n[04] Baby Grand\n[05] This Is The Time\n[06] Leningrad\n[07] We Didn't Start The Fire\n[08] I Go To Extremes\n[09] And So It Goes\n[10] The Downeaster &quot;Alexa&quot;\n[11] Shameless\n[12] All About Soul (Remix)\n[13] Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)\n[14] The River Of Dreams\n[15] To Make You Feel My Love\n[16] Hey Girl\n[17] Light As The Breeze\n\nPlay Time - 01h:16m:10s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 03h:05m:51s\nTotal File Size....................... 1.08GBs (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
