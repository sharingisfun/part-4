While classical techniques are discussed, Chau also covers state space modeling and control, a modern control topic lacking in most introductory texts. MATLAB, a popular engineering software package, is employed as a powerful yet approachable computational tool. Each chapter concludes with problem sets, to which hints or solutions are provided. The support website provides excellent support in the way of MATLAB outputs of text examples and MATLAB sessions, references, and supplementary notes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:062fa3c58fc3d96779af085c3454b9b06c323ab9","amp;dn":"Process+Control+-+A+First+Course+with+MATLAB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"062fa3c58fc3d96779af085c3454b9b06c323ab9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,47,163,197,143,195,217,103,121,175,8,92,52,84,185,176,108,50,58,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
