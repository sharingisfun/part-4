The list of authors to these titles contains tens of prominent and reputable thinkers, philosophers, theologians, historians and scientists. \nTo this list, we must add the names of three great men: Thomas Paine (1737-1809), Robert G. Ingersoll (1833-1899), and Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900). \n\nThis upload includes some of their writings:\n\n1- The Age of Reason; by: Thomas Paine, 1794.\n2- The Antichrist; by: Friedrich Nietzsche, 1899.\n3- Some Mistakes of Moses; by: Robert G. Ingersoll, 1889.\n4- The Gods and Other Lectures; by: Robert G. Ingersoll, 1892.\n5- What Must We Do to be Saved; by: Robert G. Ingersoll, 1880.\n6- The Christian Religion; by: Robert G. Ingersoll, 1882.\n\nAn excerpt form &quot;The Gods&quot; by Ingersoll:\n&quot;All that is necessary, as it seems to me, to convince any reasonable person that the bible is simply and purely of human invention ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ of barbarian inventionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½is to read it. Read it as you would any other book; think of it as you would of any other; get the bandage of reverence from your eyes; drive from your heart the phantom of fear; push from the throne of your brain the cowled form of superstition ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ then read the holy bible, and you will be amazed that you ever, for one moment, supposed a being of infinite wisdom, goodness and purity, to be the author of such ignorance and of such atrocity.&quot;\n\nAn excerpt from the &quot;Age of Reason ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Part First&quot;, by Paine:\n&quot;Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and torturous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness, with which more than half the Bible is filled, it would be more consistent that we called it the word of a demon, than the word of God. It is a history of wickedness, that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind; and, for my part, I sincerely detest it, as I detest everything that is cruel.&quot;\n\nAn excerpt form &quot;The Antichrist&quot; by Nietzsche:\n&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½With this I come to a conclusion and pronounce my judgment. I condemn Christianity; I bring against the Christian church the most terrible of all the accusations that an accuser has ever had in his mouth. It is, to me, the greatest of all imaginable corruptions; it seeks to work the ultimate corruption, the worst possible corruption. The Christian church has left nothing untouched by its depravity; it has turned every value into worthlessness, and every truth into a lie, and every integrity into baseness of soul. Let any one dare to speak to me of its ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhumanitarianÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ blessings! Its deepest necessities range it against any effort to abolish distress; it lives by distress; it creates distress to make itself immortal.... &quot;\n&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.This eternal accusation against Christianity I shall write upon all walls, wherever walls are to be foundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½I have letters that even the blind will be able to see.... I call Christianity the one great curse, the one great intrinsic depravity, the one great instinct of revenge, for which no means are venomous enough, or secret, subterranean and small enough,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½I call it the one immortal blemish upon the human race....&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9f2b8ae5995662a976e97032a5480353e49c597","amp;dn":"Paine%2C+Ingersoll+and+Nietzsche+vs+Christianity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9f2b8ae5995662a976e97032a5480353e49c597","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,242,184,174,89,149,102,42,151,110,151,3,42,84,128,53,62,73,197,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
