It's been years since she jilted him for another man, but that only means there's a lot to catch up on, a lot to make up for, and that he's going to enjoy every sweet moment...\n\nThe same drive and passion that sent her into another man's arms is what brings Elizabeth back to Marcus. Her attraction to him is the one thing she fears, but she's run out of options. Resisting is impossible. But does she have the courage to surrender everything?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54980867b2b386c0514730578e124808f5ed501c","amp;dn":"Sylvia+Day+-+Ask+For+It","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54980867b2b386c0514730578e124808f5ed501c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,152,8,103,178,179,134,192,81,71,48,87,142,18,72,8,245,237,80,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
