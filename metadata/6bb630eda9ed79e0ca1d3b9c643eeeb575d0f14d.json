Since the mid-'60s, Jones has sung nearly every form of popular music -- pop, rock, show tunes, country, dance, and techno, he's sung it all. His actual style -- a full-throated, robust baritone that had little regard for nuance and subtlety -- never changed, he just sang over different backing tracks. On-stage, Jones played up his sexual appeal; it didn't matter whether he was in an unbuttoned shirt or a tuxedo, he always radiated a raw sexuality which earned him a large following of devoted female fans who frequently threw underwear on-stage. Jones' following never diminished over the decades; he was able to exploit trends, earning new fans while retaining his core following. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.It's Not Unusual\n02.Love Me Tonight\n03.Delilah\n04.She's Lady\n05.Green Green Grass Of Home\n06.I Can't Turn You Loose\n07.Once Upon A Time\n08.I Got Your Number\n09.I'll Never Fall In Love\n10.Thunderball\n11.Sixteen Tons\n12.Daughter Of Darkness\n13.Help Yourself\n14.Can't Stop Loving You\n15.With These Hands\n16.Till\n17.When The World Was Beautiful\n18.I Wake Up Crying\n19.What's New Pussycat\n20.Sky Boat Song\n21.Letter To Lucille\n22.Funny Familiar Forgotten Feelings\n23.Ain't No Sunshine\n24.I'm Coming Home\n25.To Make A Big Man Cry\n26.I ( Who Have Nothing)\n27.Autumn Leaves\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.If He Should Ever Leave You\n02.If I Only Knew\n03.In Style And Rhythm\n04.Sexbomb (Peppermint Jam Mix) (With Mousse T.)\n05.Stoned In Love (With Chicane)\n06.Kiss (With Art Of Noise)\n07.I'm Alive\n08.Burning Down The House (With The Cardigans)\n09.Mama Told Me Not To Come (With Stereophonics)\n10.Give A Little Love\n11.Black Betty\n12.Sunny Afternoon (With Space)\n13.Venus\n14.It'll Be Me (With Jools Holland)\n15.Feels Like Music\n16.Tom Jones International\n17.I Don't Think So (LP Version)\n18.Motherless Child (With Portishead)\n19.Baby, It's Cold Outside (With Cerys Matthews)\n20.You Need Love Like I Do (With Heather Small)\n21.All Mine (With The Divine Comedy)\n22.I Wanna Get Back With You (With Tori Amos)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
