Their second album One with the Underdogs sold over 40,000 copies. They have toured throughout Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, Mexico and South America. Their third album, Always the Hard Way reached No. 10 on Billboard Heatseekers and No. 19 on the Top Independent Records chart.\n\nBefore Terror, vocalist Scott Vogel sang for Slugfest, Despair, and for Buffalo based metalcore act Buried Alive in the mid-90's. Drummer Nick Jett and ex-guitarist Todd Jones were members of the well-known hardcore band Carry On (who had releases on Bridge Nine and Youngblood Records). Carl Schwartz, formerly of Sworn Vengeance, recorded much of Always the Hard Way after quitting the band to front First Blood full-time. H.D. Landry, of Out Of Order fame, joined, then quickly left to pursue other endeavors.\n\nVogel is widely known in the scene not just for his efforts to keep hardcore &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;fun,&quot; but for his love of stagedives, and for his tendency for bizarre and often hilarious on-stage banter, known colloquially as &quot;Vogelisms&quot;. Examples include: &quot;We need to elevate the maximum stagedive potential&quot;, &quot;Take this shit to the next level&quot;, &quot;Big pet sauce&quot;, &quot;Who cares if you're Christian?&quot;, and &quot;Maximum output! Activate the pit!&quot; Terror also participated in the first two years of the Sounds of the Underground tour. Their latest album Live by the Code, originally due out in 2012, was pushed back to April 2013, released by Victory Records on CD and by Reaper Records on vinyl. It was the band's first time charting on the the Billboard 200, peaking at #121. It was also number one on the Heatseekers chart and #28 on Independent char, and sold 3,177 copies in its first week. \t\nKeepers Of the Faith\nStudio album by Terror\nReleased \t2010\nGenre \tHardcore punk, metalcore\nLength \t39:02\nLabel \tCentury Media\nTerror chronology\nThe Damned, The Shamed\n(2008) \tKeepers Of the Faith\n(2010) \tLive By the Code\n(2013)\nProfessional ratings\nReview scores\nSource \tRating\nSputnik Music \t3.5/5 stars[1]\n\nKeepers Of the Faith is the fourth studio album by Los Angeles hardcore punk band Terror.
