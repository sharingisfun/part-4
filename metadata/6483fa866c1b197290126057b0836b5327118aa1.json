While there are many answers to the question of Ã¢â‚¬Å“what went wrongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the Muslim world, no one has decisively answered why it went wrong. Until now.\nIn this eye-opening new book, foreign policy expert Robert R. Reilly uncovers the root of our contemporary crisis: a pivotal struggle waged within the Muslim world nearly a millennium ago. In a heated battle over the role of reason, the side of irrationality won. The deformed theology that resulted, Reilly reveals, produced the spiritual pathology of Islamism, and a deeply dysfunctional culture.\nTerrorismÃ¢â‚¬â€from 9/11, to London, Madrid, and Mumbai, to the Christmas 2009 attempted airline bombingÃ¢â‚¬â€is the most obvious manifestation of this crisis. But Reilly shows that the pathology extends much further. The Closing of the Muslim Mind solves such puzzles as:\nÃ‚Â· why peace is so elusive in the Middle East.\nÃ‚Â· why the Arab world stands near the bottom of every measure of human development.\nÃ‚Â· why scientific inquiry is nearly dead in the Islamic world.\nÃ‚Â· why Spain translates more books in a single year than the entire Arab world has in the past thousand years.\nÃ‚Â· why some people in Saudi Arabia still refuse to believe man has been to the moon.\nÃ‚Â· why Muslim media frequently present natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina as GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s direct retribution.\nDelving deeper than previous polemics and simplistic analyses, The Closing of the Muslim Mind provides the answers the West has so desperately needed in confronting the Islamist crisis.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6483fa866c1b197290126057b0836b5327118aa1","amp;dn":"The+Closing+of+the+Muslim+Mind+How+Intellectual+Suicide+Created+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6483fa866c1b197290126057b0836b5327118aa1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,131,250,134,108,27,25,114,144,18,96,87,176,131,107,83,39,17,138,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
