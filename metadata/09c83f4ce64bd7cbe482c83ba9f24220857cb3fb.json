At its beginnings in the 1870s were dynamite, the telephone, photographic film, and the first light bulbs. Its peak decade - the astonishing 1880s - brought electricity - generating plants, electric motors, steam turbines, the gramophone, cars, aluminum production, air-filled rubber tires, and prestressed concrete. And its post-1900 period saw the first airplanes, tractors, radio signals and plastics, neon lights and assembly line production. This book is a systematic interdisciplinary account of the history of this outpouring of European and American intellect and of its truly epochal consequences. It takes a close look at four fundamental classes of these epoch-making innovations: formation, diffusion, and standardization of electric systems; invention and rapid adoption of internal combustion engines; the unprecedented pace of new chemical syntheses and material substitutions; and the birth of a new information age. These chapters are followed by an evaluation of the lasting impact these advances had on the 20th century, that is, the creation of high-energy societies engaged in mass production aimed at improving standards of living.\n\n\n\nazw3 file that ya put in Kindle file directory. or convert it in Calibre, or Online via Zamzar, or add to pasta salad and chow down.\n\nlove y'all\\\n\n       h   eli            i aru       y  y   u    r                a iil   e    h","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09c83f4ce64bd7cbe482c83ba9f24220857cb3fb","amp;dn":"Creating+the+Twentieth+Century%3A+Technical+Innovations+1867-1914","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09c83f4ce64bd7cbe482c83ba9f24220857cb3fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,200,63,76,230,75,215,203,228,130,200,59,169,242,66,32,133,124,179,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
