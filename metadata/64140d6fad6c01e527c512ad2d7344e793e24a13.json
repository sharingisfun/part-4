With this illustrated guide, you will learn the benefits of having a Makerspace shared space with a set of shared tools that attracts fellow makers and gives you more resources to work with. You will find clear explanations of the tools, software, materials, and layout you need to get started, everything from basic electronics to rapid prototyping technology and inexpensive 3D printers.\n\nA Makerspace is the perfect solution for many makers today. While you can get a lot done in a fully-decked out shop, you will always have trouble making space for the next great tool you need. And the one thing you really miss out on in a personal shop is the collaboration with other makers. A Makerspace provides you with the best of both worlds.\n\nPerfect for any maker, educator, or community, this book shows you how to organize your environment to provide a safe and fun workflow, and demonstrates how you can use that space to educate others.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nChapter 1.
