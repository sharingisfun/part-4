Roy Thomas Baker temporarily reunited with Queen and became their producer; it was three years since he co-produced Queen's 1975 album A Night at the Opera, but this album also was the last he co-produced for the band. The album's varying musical styles were alternately praised and criticised. It reached No. 6 on the US Billboard 200, and it was subject to a viciously scathing Rolling Stone review by Dave Marsh, which included the suggestion that &quot;Queen may be the first truly fascist rock band&quot;.\n\nQueen sold the album with a poster depicting the all-female nude bicycle race staged to promote &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot;. A small version of the poster comes with the Crown Jewels box set. This was the first Queen album recorded outside the UK, for tax purposes. Included in the liner notes is the attribution &quot;Thunderbolt courtesy of God&quot;, referring to the crash of thunder heard at the end of the song &quot;Dead On Time&quot; which May recorded with a portable audio recorder during a thunderstorm. The album artwork was suggested by Roger Taylor, who previously saw a similar design painted on the Berlin Wall.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Mustapha&quot;   \tFreddie Mercury \t3:01\n02. \t&quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot;   \tBrian May \t4:16\n03. \t&quot;Jealousy&quot;   \tMercury \t3:14\n04. \t&quot;Bicycle Race&quot;   \tMercury \t3:01\n05. \t&quot;If You Can't Beat Them&quot;   \tJohn Deacon \t4:15\n06. \t&quot;Let Me Entertain You&quot;   \tMercury \t3:01\n07. \t&quot;Dead on Time&quot;   \tMay \t3:23\n08. \t&quot;In Only Seven Days&quot;   \tDeacon \t2:30\n09. \t&quot;Dreamer's Ball&quot;   \tMay \t3:30\n10. \t&quot;Fun It&quot;   \tRoger Taylor \t3:29\n11. \t&quot;Leaving Home Ain't Easy&quot;   \tMay \t3:15\n12. \t&quot;Don't Stop Me Now&quot;   \tMercury \t3:29\n13. \t&quot;More of That Jazz&quot;   \tTaylor \t4:16\n\n2011 Bonus EP\n\n01. \t&quot;Fat Bottomed Girls (Single version)&quot;   \t3:23\n02. \t&quot;Bicycle Race (Instrumental)&quot;   \t3:09\n03. \t&quot;Don't Stop Me Now (With long-lost guitars)&quot;   \t3:34\n04. \t&quot;Let Me Entertain You (Live in Montreal, November 1981)&quot;   \t2:48\n05. \t&quot;Dreamer's Ball (Early acoustic take, August 1978)&quot;   \t3:40","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e4d06f10db4093ca98c91de46830244f37013e7","amp;dn":"Queen+-+Jazz+%5Bwith+BONUS+EP%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e4d06f10db4093ca98c91de46830244f37013e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,77,6,241,13,180,9,60,169,140,145,222,70,131,2,68,243,112,19,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
