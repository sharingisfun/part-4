Arc welding control details Professor Pan Jiluan's remarkable achievements in this area using innovative methods which have given outstanding results and which have not been described in any previous publication. Arc welding control covers all aspects of the technology. Part 1 quantitatively describes the dynamic behaviour of arc welding, the power sources used and their effect on welding technology through the basis of control theory. Part 2 then describes new ways of controlling the welding arc through modern electronics. Part 3 establishes the first mathematical model of the arc sensor on the basis of control theory and Part 4 describes a new method for measuring weldment temperature fields using the colorimetric-imaging method. Part 5 describes the idea of recognizing weld grooves with a three-dimensional vision system and automatic programming of the weld path. This comprehensive and authoritative treatment of the arc welding process and its control will make Arc welding control the essential resource for all welding engineers looking to use the technique to its maximum effectiveness.\nAbout the Author\nPan Jiluan is Professor and Chair of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Tsinghua University, Beijing and is also President of Nanchang University, China. He was appointed Honorary Professor of the Institute of Technology at the State University of New York, USA in 1994 and served as Vice-President of the Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society from 1986 to 1996. He is an active member of The Chinese Academy of Sciences and was Vice President of the International Institute of Welding during the 1980s. Professor Pan is a former President of the Chinese Welding Institute and has been a visiting Associate Professor at Ohio State University, USA and at Aachen University in Germany. He has published over 100 technical papers and books, including 10 patents in China and the USA, and has been awarded many international prizes including the first National Prize for \nInnovation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Hardcover: 624 pages\n# Publisher: Woodhead Publishing Ltd (July 18, 2003)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 185573687X\n# ISBN-13: 978-1855736870","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ddf292c1a0719e524b0204685a03c8344696206","amp;dn":"Arc+welding+control%5BBBS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ddf292c1a0719e524b0204685a03c8344696206","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,223,41,44,26,7,25,229,36,176,32,70,133,160,60,131,68,105,98,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
