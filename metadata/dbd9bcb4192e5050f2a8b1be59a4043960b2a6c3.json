The series revolved around a fictionalized Philadelphia Police Department division that specializes in investigating cold cases.\n\nThe show is set in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and follows Detective Lilly Rush (Kathryn Morris), a homicide detective with the Philadelphia Police Department, who specializes in &quot;cold cases&quot;, or investigations which are no longer being actively pursued by the department. Rush was initially partnered with Detective Chris Lassing (Justin Chambers) in the first season and then with Detective Scotty Valens (Danny Pino) for the remainder of the series. They work under Lieutenant John Stillman (John Finn) and are assisted by other detectives from their squad Nick Vera (Jeremy Ratchford), Will Jeffries (Thom Barry), and beginning in season three, Kat Miller (Tracie Thoms).\n\nUsually, each episode would focus on a single investigation. All cases involved murders committed in Philadelphia, although investigations occasionally required travel outside the city. Cases were also spread out over much of the previous century, with some as recent as a year or two old and others dating back to the 1910s. Generally, an investigation would begin when the police received a new lead, or &quot;new direction,&quot; on a case. This might be the discovery of a body or a critical piece of evidence such as a murder weapon (e.g., one investigation began when a gun received in a gun buyback program was linked to a murder through ballistic evidence). In some cases, the lack of a body meant that it was originally unclear if a crime had even occurred, with people instead believing that the victim had merely left town.\n\nOver the course of the episode, the detectives would interview witnesses associated with the crime and piece together the story of what led the victims to their death. These interviews were accompanied by flashback sequences to the time of the murder which dramatized the testimony. Witness testimony, even from people who would later be revealed as the killer, was almost never false. At most the guilty party would lie by omission, leaving out critical details, or stopping their narrative before they implicated themselves. The witness testimony was also generally presented in chronological order so that it formed a cohesive linear story for the audience.\n\nAt the end of the episode, the police would be shown arresting the killer and walking them into custody as the spirit of the victim looked on appreciatively. This would be accompanied by the playing of a song meant to symbolize the period in which the killing took place.\n\nThrough the flashbacks, the show examined many issues related to 20th century history, including: racism, homophobia, sexism, abortion, and police brutality. Some of the cases were based off of real life events or victims, akin to the 'ripped from the headlines' style from shows like Law &amp; Order.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbd9bcb4192e5050f2a8b1be59a4043960b2a6c3","amp;dn":"Cold+Case+Seasons+1-7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbd9bcb4192e5050f2a8b1be59a4043960b2a6c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,217,188,180,25,46,80,80,242,168,177,190,89,164,4,57,96,178,166,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
