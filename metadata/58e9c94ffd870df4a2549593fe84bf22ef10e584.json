Cohen published his first book of poetry in Montreal in 1956 and his first novel in 1963. Cohen&amp;#039;s earliest songs (many of which appeared on the 1968 album Songs of Leonard Cohen) were rooted in European folk music melodies and instrumentation, sung in an high baritone.\n\nThe 1970s were a musically restless period in which his influences broadened to encompass pop, cabaret, and world music. Since the 1980s he has typically sung in lower registers (bass baritone, sometimes bass), with accompaniment from electronic synthesizers and female backing singers. His work often explores the themes of religion, isolation, sexuality, and complex interpersonal relationships.\n\nThe Best of Leonard Cohen \n\nTrack Listings \n1. Suzanne  \n2.
