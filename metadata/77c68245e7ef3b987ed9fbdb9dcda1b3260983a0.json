All an engineer needs to do is connect various validated components to simply and accurately predict multi-disciplinary system performance.\n\nWith extensive dedicated libraries, LMS Imagine.Lab AMESim actually saves enormous amounts of time by eliminating the need for extensive modeling. Thanks to application-specific simulation, engineers can assess a variety of subsystems in multiple physical domains. This way design and engineering teams can carefully balance product performance according to various brand-critical attributes to achieve the best possible design way before committing to expensive and time-consuming prototype testing. Since LMS Imagine.Lab AMESim actually frontloads system simulation early in the development cycle, it truly allows mission-critical design functionality to drive new product development.\n\nLMS.IMAGINE.LAB.AMESIM.R13-MAGNiTUDE\n\nHome Page - http://www.lmsintl.com/LMS-Imagine-Lab-AMESim\nRead more at http://avaxhome.cc/software/software_type/graphics_cad_cam/cad_cam/LMS.IMAGINE.LAB.AMESIM.R13.html#8w0Q0DQMyTWP5Z2Z.99","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77c68245e7ef3b987ed9fbdb9dcda1b3260983a0","amp;dn":"LMS+IMAGINE+LAB+AMESIM+R13+-+MAGNiTUDE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77c68245e7ef3b987ed9fbdb9dcda1b3260983a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,198,130,69,231,239,59,152,126,217,251,219,157,205,161,179,38,9,131,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
