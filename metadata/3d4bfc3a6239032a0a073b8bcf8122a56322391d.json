Steely Dan's &quot;cerebral, wry and eccentric&quot; lyrics, \noften filled with sharp sarcasm, touch upon such themes as drugs, love affairs, and crime. The pair is well-known \nfor their near-obsessive perfectionism in the recording studio, with one notable example being that Becker and \nFagen used at least 42 different studio musicians, 11 engineers, and took over a year to record the tracks that \nresulted in 1980's Gaucho ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ an album that contains only seven songs.\n\nSteely Dan toured from 1972 to 1974, but in 1975 became a purely studio-based act. The late 1970s saw the group \nrelease a series of moderately successful singles and albums. They disbanded in 1981, and throughout most of the \nnext decade, Fagen and Becker remained largely inactive in the music world. During this time, the group steadily \nbuilt and maintained &quot;a cult following.&quot; In 1993, the group resumed playing live concerts; later Steely Dan \nreleased two albums of new material, the first of which earned a Grammy Award for Album of the Year. They have \nsold more than 30 million albums worldwide and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2001\n\nGaucho is the seventh studio album by the American Jazz rock band Steely Dan, released in 1980. The sessions for \nGaucho represented the peak of Steely Dan's recording studio perfectionism and obsessive recording techniques. \nTo record the album, the band used at least 42 different musicians, spent over a year in the studio, and far \nexceeded the original monetary advance given to the band by their record label.\n\nDuring the two-year span in which the album was recorded, the band was plagued by a number of creative, personal \nand professional problems. MCA, Warner Bros. and Steely Dan had a three-way legal battle over the rights to release \nthe album. After the record was released, jazz musician Keith Jarrett successfully sued the band for writing credit \non the song &quot;Gaucho&quot;.\n\nGaucho marked a significant stylistic change for Steely Dan, introducing a more minimal, groove- and atmosphere\nbased format. The harmonically complex chord changes that were a distinctive mark of earlier Steely Dan songs are \nless prominent on Gaucho, with the record's songs tending to revolve around a certain rhythm or mood. Gaucho proved \nto be Steely Dan's final studio album before a 12-year hiatus.\n\n\n   1. Steely Dan - Babylon Sisters                            [05:56]\n   2.
