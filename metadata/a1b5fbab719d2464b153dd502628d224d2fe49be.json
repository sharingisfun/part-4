Yet this was who Hitler chose to slaughter\nas children too! Insane!\n\nThere is the greatest potential of Europe - in bringing together all great \nspirits such as these together in fairness and justice in what is forming\nof a Union at the EU parliament, as compared to what has ever been envisioned\ninstead.\n\nNothing but a greatest human spirit of true moral virtue is supreme, and all\nelse remain hypocritical charlatans - as was certainly true of the Hitler mindset\nthen as it is today, Following such ideas of supremacy as Hitler only destroys \nwhat is best in us all - if we are inclined to for real, rather than being forced\nto, that is! A couple of movie soundtrack selections are included for you too,\nby the way! Please seed! Grazie!\n\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmoviesbyrizzo\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1b5fbab719d2464b153dd502628d224d2fe49be","amp;dn":"La+vita+e+bella+%281997%29+720p+DivX+HD+%28moviesbyrizzo%29+3.3GB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1b5fbab719d2464b153dd502628d224d2fe49be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,181,251,171,113,157,36,100,177,83,221,80,38,40,210,36,210,254,73,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
