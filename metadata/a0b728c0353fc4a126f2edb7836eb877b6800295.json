This course is designed for users that already have a solid understanding of Inventor. You will start by learning how to work with large assemblies, then jump into learning about advanced constraints, such as flexible components and transitional constraints. Adam will teach you about positional representations, as well as the level of detail representations. This video tutorial will also cover the frame generator and weldments environments in Inventor. Once you have completed this video based training course, you will be fully capable of creating your own assemblies in Inventor using these advanced techniques","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0b728c0353fc4a126f2edb7836eb877b6800295","amp;dn":"InfiniteSkills+-+Mastering+Autodesk+Inventor+%3A+Advanced+Assembli","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0b728c0353fc4a126f2edb7836eb877b6800295","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,183,40,192,53,63,196,161,38,242,237,183,131,110,184,119,182,128,2,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
