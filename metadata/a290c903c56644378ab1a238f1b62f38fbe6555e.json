With disciplined reporting and a storytellerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eye for revealing detail, Peter Slevin follows Michelle to the White House from her working-class childhood on ChicagoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largely segregated South Side.\nThe journey winds from the intricacies of her upbringing as the highly focused daughter of a gregarious city water-plant worker afflicted with multiple sclerosis to the tribulations she faces at Princeton University and Harvard Law School during the racially charged 1980s. And then returning to Chicago, where she works in an elite law firm and meets a law student from Hawaii named Barack Obama. Unsatisfied by corporate law, Michelle embarks on a search for meaningful work that takes her back to the community of her South Side youth, even as she struggles to find balance as a mother and a professionalÃ¢â‚¬â€while married to a man who wants to be president.\nSlevin deftly explores the drama of BarackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s historic campaigns and the harsh glare faced by Michelle in a role both relentlessly public and not entirely of her choosing. He offers a fresh and compelling view of the White House years when Michelle Obama casts herself as mentor, teacher, champion of nutrition, supporter of military families, and fervent opponent of inequality.\n\nAbout the Author\nPETER SLEVIN spent a decade on the national staff of The Washington Post before joining Northwestern UniversityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Medill School of Journalism, where he is an associate professor. He has written extensively about Barack and Michelle Obama, as well as political campaigns and policy debates from one end of the country to the other. Slevin graduated from Princeton and Oxford. He lives with his family in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nCONTENTS\nCover\nTitle Page\nCopyright\nDedication\nIllustration Credits\nIntroduction\n1 ChicagoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Promise\n2 South Side\n3 Destiny Not Yet Written\n4 Orange and Blackness\n5 Progress in Everything and Nothing\n6 Finding the Right Thing\n7 Assets and Deficits\n8 A Little Tension with That\n9 Just DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Screw It Up\n10 IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Pretty Convincing\n11 Veil of Impossibility\n12 Nothing Would Have Predicted\n13 Between Politics and Sanity\n14 Simple Gifts\n15 I Am No Different from You\nEpilogue\nAcknowledgments\nNotes\nBibliography\nIndex\nIllustrations  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s28.postimg.org/yz7ph84l9/Michelle_Obama_A_Life.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s28.postimg.org/yz7ph84l9/Michelle_Obama_A_Life.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a290c903c56644378ab1a238f1b62f38fbe6555e","amp;dn":"Michelle+Obama+-+A+Life+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a290c903c56644378ab1a238f1b62f38fbe6555e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,144,201,3,197,102,68,55,138,177,162,56,241,182,47,56,251,230,85,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
