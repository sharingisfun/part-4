Far from the stereotypes of contentiousness or quarrelsomeness, argumentation is the study of reasons given by people to justify their acts or beliefs and to influence the thought or action of others. It is concerned with communication that seeks to persuade others through reasoned judgment. The course is introductory in that it does not presume any prior study of argumentation. Because all of us practice argumentation, however, the course is also sophisticated in that it offers a systematic analysis, a precise vocabulary, and a philosophical foundation for what all too often is an activity that we conduct intuitively and unconsciously.\n\nCourse Lecture Titles\n24 Lectures\n30 minutes / lecture\n\n\n1 Introducing Argumentation and Rhetoric\n2 Underlying Assumptions of Argumentation\n3 Formal and Informal Argumentation\n4 History of Argumentation Studies\n5 Argument Analysis and Diagramming\n6 Complex Structures of Argument\n7 Case ConstructionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Requirements and Options\n8 StasisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Heart of the Controversy\n9 Attack and Defense I\n10 Attack and Defense II\n11 Language and Style in Argument\n12 Evaluating Evidence\n13 Reasoning from Parts to Whole\n14 Reasoning with Comparisons\n15 Establishing Correlations\n16 Moving from Cause to Effect\n17 Commonplaces and Arguments from Form\n18 Hybrid Patterns of Inference\n19 Validity and Fallacies I\n20 Validity and Fallacies II\n21 Arguments between Friends\n22 Arguments among Experts\n23 Public Argument and Democratic Life\n24 The Ends of Argumentation ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae55be27be607ac5300c910090e6a5f94b35ac2f","amp;dn":"TTC+-+Argumentation+-+The+Study+of+Effective+Reasoning+%282nd+Ed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae55be27be607ac5300c910090e6a5f94b35ac2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,85,190,39,190,96,122,197,48,12,145,0,144,230,165,249,75,53,172,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
