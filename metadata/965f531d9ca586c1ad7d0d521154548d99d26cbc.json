(AMG)\n\n\n\n\nOn THE MACK, the soundtrack to to the cult film starring Max Julien, Roger Mosley (pre- &quot;Magnum P.I.&quot;) and Richard Pryor, 70s Motown artist Willie Hutch dazzles with his &quot;Bobby Womack meets Bill Withers&quot; vocals, earthy lyrics, southern soul-style guitar picking and excellent string and horn arrangements. \n\nThe two singles from this album (&quot;Brother's Gonna Work It Out&quot; and &quot;Slick) became top 20 r&amp;b hits, while the respectably sexy &quot;I Choose You&quot; was a popular black radio album cut. Other highlights from this set include the mournful &quot;Mama's Song&quot;, the wistful &quot;Now That It's All Over&quot; and the pumpin' title track. \n\nLike most blaxploitation soundtracks of the 70's, THE MACK features wah-wah guitars and sooperbaaad &quot;chick&quot; background singers. However, these cliches actually enhance these thought-provoking songs. Overall, THE MACK is like Curtis Mayfield's SUPERFLY. Both soundtracks have seven songs and two instrumentals as well as lyrics that act as a Greek chorus to warn the listeners about the dangers of street life. (Customer from Amazon)\n\n\n\n\n\n01.
