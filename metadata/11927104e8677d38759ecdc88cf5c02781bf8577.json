Despite the prominence of punk rock during the band's early years, the band's stripped-down sound contrasted with punk, demonstrating a more &quot;rootsy&quot; influence that emerged out of pub rock. Many of Dire Straits' compositions were melancholic.[1] Dire Straits became one of the world's most commercially successful bands, and sold over 120 million albums worldwide.[2] The band's biggest selling album, Brothers in Arms, has sold over 30 million copies.[3]\n\nDire Straits won numerous music awards during their career, including three BRIT Awards, four Grammys, and two MTV Video Music Awards.[2] Dire Straits' most popular songs include &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;, &quot;Private Investigations&quot;, &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;, &quot;Walk of Life&quot;, &quot;So Far Away&quot; and &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;. \n\n\n\n\n\nMoney For Nothing 1988\n\n\nMoney for Nothing is a greatest hits album by Dire Straits released in 1988. It features highlights from the band's first five albums. The vinyl edition omits &quot;Telegraph Road&quot; and has a different running order, with &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; placed between &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;, the title track, and &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;. The collection went to #1 on the UK Albums Chart. It sold 6.6 million copies in Europe and one million in the U.S.\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Sultans of Swing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:46\n2.\t&quot;Down to the Waterline&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01\n3.\t&quot;Portobello Belle--Live&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:33\n4.\t&quot;Twisting by the Pool (Remix)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30\n5.\t&quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; (Intro by Rodgers/Hammerstein) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:10\n6.\t&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:56\n7.\t&quot;Where Do You Think You're Going?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30\n8.\t&quot;Walk of Life&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n9.\t&quot;Private Investigations&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:50\n10.\t&quot;Telegraph Road--Live (Remix)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 11:59\n11.\t&quot;Money for Nothing&quot; (Mark Knopfler, Sting) single edit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:06\n12.\t&quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:49\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11927104e8677d38759ecdc88cf5c02781bf8577","amp;dn":"Dire+Straits+-+Money+For+Nothing+%28Greatest+Hits%29+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11927104e8677d38759ecdc88cf5c02781bf8577","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,146,113,4,232,103,125,56,117,158,205,200,140,245,192,39,129,191,133,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
