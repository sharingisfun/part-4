Football Manager 2013 celebrates 20 years of games from the people at Sports Interactive by introducing an array of new features.\n\n\nNEW TO CAREER MODE\n------------------\nMatch Engine\nThe 3D match engine has seen huge improvements this year. Everything on the pitch looks more realistic; from the stadiums, the playersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ movement, intelligence, and the way the ball moves through the air.\n\nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve also introduced hundreds of new animations to make the game feel more realistic and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve made the whole experience more televisual by introducing new camera angles and showing the kick-off and final whistle.\n\nManager Roles\nAnother notable difference is the significant restructure of the managerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s staff and a revamp of their roles. The most obvious is that weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve introduced the position of Director of Football into the game for the first time, which will allow managers to pass on some of their workload, such as contract negotiations, if they choose to.\n\nIn addition to this, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve also increased the number of specialist coaching roles within the game and given the manager greater flexibility to choose which coaches offer advice and when. The manager can also choose to complain about boardroom interference Ã¢â‚¬â€œ although that particular option should probably be used sparingly.\n\nAnd much moreÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nA brand new training system, improved international management, tones in press conferences &amp; a new user interface.\n\n\nInstallation:\n------------\n1.Unzip\n2.Wait for crack\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSee my other torrent here: http://thepiratebay.se/user/3R01/\n                           ---------------------------------\n\n\nComment and Seed :D\t\n\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff73bfa9e4e7b9143981ff8d48a37d5d89716e27","amp;dn":"Football+Manager+2013-FULL+UNLOCKED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff73bfa9e4e7b9143981ff8d48a37d5d89716e27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,115,191,169,228,231,185,20,57,129,255,141,72,163,125,93,137,113,110,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
