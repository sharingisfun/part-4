However he emigrated to England in 1914 (at age 25) and was naturalised as a British subject in 1927 at age 39.\n\nEliot attracted widespread attention for his poem The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock (1915), which is seen as a masterpiece of the Modernist movement. It was followed by some of the best-known poems in the English language, including The Waste Land (1922), The Hollow Men (1925), Ash Wednesday (1930) and Four Quartets (1945). He is also known for his seven plays, particularly Murder in the Cathedral (1935). He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1948, &quot;for his outstanding, pioneer contribution to present-day poetry.&quot;\n\nTypically, Eliot first published his poems individually in periodicals or in small books or pamphlets, and then collected them in books. His first collection was Prufrock and Other Observations (1917). In 1920, he published more poems in Ara Vos Prec (London) and Poems: 1920 (New York). These had the same poems (in a different order) except that &quot;Ode&quot; in the British edition was replaced with &quot;Hysteria&quot; in the American edition. In 1925, he collected The Waste Land and the poems in Prufrock and Poems into one volume and added The Hollow Men to form Poems: 1909Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1925. From then on, he updated this work as Collected Poems. Exceptions are Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats (1939), a collection of light verse; Poems Written in Early Youth, posthumously published in 1967 and consisting mainly of poems published between 1907 and 1910 in The Harvard Advocate, and Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1917, material Eliot never intended to have published, which appeared posthumously in 1997.\n\nDuring an interview in 1959, Eliot said of his nationality and its role in his work: &quot;I'd say that my poetry has obviously more in common with my distinguished contemporaries in America than with anything written in my generation in England. That I'm sure of. ... It wouldn't be what it is, and I imagine it wouldn't be so good; putting it as modestly as I can, it wouldn't be what it is if I'd been born in England, and it wouldn't be what it is if I'd stayed in America. It's a combination of things. But in its sources, in its emotional springs, it comes from America.&quot;\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats\n\n* The Complete Poems and Plays of T.
