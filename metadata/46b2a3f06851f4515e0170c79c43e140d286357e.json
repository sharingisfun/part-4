For most of the band's existence, the members have been vocalist Anthony Kiedis, guitarist John Frusciante, bassist Michael &quot;Flea&quot; Balzary, and drummer Chad Smith. The band's varied musical style has fused traditional rock and funk with various elements of punk rock, and psychedelic rock.\n\nIn addition to Kiedis and Flea, the group originally featured guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons. Slovak, however, died of a heroin overdose in 1988, resulting in Irons' departure. Irons was replaced by Chad Smith, while Slovak was replaced by up-and-coming guitarist Frusciante. This lineup recorded the band's fourth and fifth albums, Mother's Milk (1989) and Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991).\n\nBlood Sugar Sex Magik became an extremely significant record for the band; it thrust them into mainstream success with over thirteen million copies sold. Frusciante grew uncomfortable with this new found success and left abruptly in the middle of the tour for the album in 1992, descending into heroin addiction.\n\nFrusciante, fresh out of drug rehabilitation, rejoined the band in 1998, at Flea's request. The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record Californication (1999), which went on to sell fifteen million units worldwide, becoming their most successful album to date. It was followed three years later with By the Way (2002), which continued their success. In 2006, the group released the double album Stadium Arcadium, giving them their first American number 1 album.\n\nThe band are currently on hiatus, but both Chad Smith and Anthony Kiedis have stated the band will return to the studio to work on new material later in 2009.\n\n__________________________________Tracks___________________________________________\n\n\n\n1-&quot;Around the World&quot;      3:58 \n2-&quot;Parallel Universe&quot;     4:30 \n3-&quot;Scar Tissue&quot;           3:35 \n4-&quot;Otherside&quot;             4:15 \n5-&quot;Get on Top&quot;            3:18 \n6-&quot;Californication&quot;       5:21 \n7-&quot;Easily&quot;                3:51 \n8-&quot;Porcelain&quot;             2:43 \n9-&quot;Emit Remmus&quot;           4:00 \n10-&quot;I Like Dirt&quot;          2:37 \n11-&quot;This Velvet Glove&quot;    3:45 \n12-&quot;Savior&quot;               4:52 \n13-&quot;Purple Stain&quot;         4:13 \n14-&quot;Right on Time&quot;        1:52 \n15-&quot;Road Trippin'&quot;        3:25 \n\n\n_________________________________Track Info________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                  AAC Audio File\n                                  256 Kbps (VBR)\n\n\n                                 No viruses, spyware or anything else\n\n\n                                 Should Have Artwork*\n\n\n* It has in my iTunes but IÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´m not sure if it goes through - Anyone who would care to tell me if it does would be very welcome\n\n\n___________________________________.:END:._________________________________________\n\n\n                             Please Seed -&gt; Sharing is Caring\n\n\n                          [ CONSTRUCTIVE comments are appreciated ]\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46b2a3f06851f4515e0170c79c43e140d286357e","amp;dn":"Californication+-+Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers+%5B1999%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46b2a3f06851f4515e0170c79c43e140d286357e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,178,163,240,104,81,244,81,94,1,112,199,156,67,225,64,210,134,53,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
