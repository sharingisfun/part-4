I have listened to Sting since his police days and this CD certainly holds some sort of record for longevity...you will listen to it for years. With many veteran side men such as Branford Marsalis, the band alone is worth listening to even though the songs featured are each collectors. Trying to rate the CD based on the backup players would be useless in that Sting uses such noteworthy musicians as Eric Clapton, Mark Knofler (Dire Straits), Andy Summers (Police), and many others, through the years to perform on these classics. I have stated in other reviews that Sting is the best I songwriter I have ever heard who uses minimal chords without being boring. These offerings covers the entire spectrum of chord use.\n\nI would recommend certain songs on this CD as the most outstanding, but that would be a waste of time--they're all great. My personal favorites are &quot;When We Dance&quot;, &quot;Fields of Gold&quot;, &quot;Fortress Around Your Heart&quot;, They Dance Alone&quot;, &quot;Fragile&quot;, &quot;Englishman in New York&quot;, &quot;Russians&quot;, &quot;The Cowboy Song&quot;, Why Should I Cry For You?&quot;, &quot;If I Ever Lose My Faith in You&quot;, &quot;All This Time&quot;, and &quot;If You Love Somebody Set Them Free&quot;. (I have listed the entire playlist).\n\nAs a professional musician, I rate CD's in two ways, song writing/musicianship, and for the number of songs I would listen to over and over again. This CD rates a solid five in both categories. This CD not only has great music, songs, and musicians, but it also has great lyrics...listen to &quot;They Dance Alone&quot; or &quot;Fields of Gold&quot;. The song &quot;Russians&quot; refers to nuclear and political fare, but in a historical perspective. He uses a theme by the famous Russian composer Prokofiev as a way to make the melody more &quot;russian&quot;\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nSting - Fields of Gold: The Best of Sting 1984-1994\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Sting\nAlbum................: Fields of Gold: The Best of Sting 1984-1994\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1994\n\nFLAC\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 62 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 260kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
