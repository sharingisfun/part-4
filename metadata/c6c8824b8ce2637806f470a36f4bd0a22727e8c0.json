The band was formed in 1998 by singers, songwriters and multi-instrumentalists Armistead Burwell Smith IV (also known as Zach Smith) and Rob Crow. The band has 2 drummers that switch off and on, Chris Prescott, and Tom Zinser. Other members of Pinback past and present are: Terrin Durfey, Eric Hoversten, Ryan Bromley, Cameron Jones, Kenseth Thideau, Gabriel Voiles, MC, Dmitri Dziensuwski, Donny Van Zandt, and Thatcher Orbitachi.\n\nThe band&amp;#039;s moniker is a reference to a character in the film Dark Star (played by Dan O&amp;#039;Bannon, who also co-wrote the film), directed by John Carpenter. Audio samples from this film are used frequently in the band&amp;#039;s early works.\n\nPinback&amp;#039;s most recent album Autumn of the Seraphs was released on September 11, 2007. The band also recently released a collection of rarities, entitled Nautical Antiques. They appeared live in a nationally broadcasted interview and played a couple of songs on NPR&amp;#039;s Talk of the Nation on October 8th, 2007.\n\n\n=================================================================\nArtist    -  Pinback       \nAlbum     -  various                                          \nGenre     -  indie                                             \nLabel     -  Touch &amp; Go, Absolutely Kosher, Ace Fu, Cutty Shark\nYear      -  1998 - present                                            \nTracks    -  n/a                                               \nPlaytime  -  n/a\nFile Type -  .mp3\nSize      -  783.76 MB\nkbps      -  VBR / 192 or higher / 256 avg\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy.
