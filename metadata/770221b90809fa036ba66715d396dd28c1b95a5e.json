It concentrated on the more serious\nside to the Amiga, and carried no entertainment content at all -\nconcentrating instead on utility software and hardware reviews, and\nmulti-issue tutorials on programming and productivity. The magazine was\nallowed to bow out gracefully in 1997, after a steady decline in page\ncount from it's peak in 1992.\n\nThese PDFs were lovingly scanned from my own collection. They've been\nOCR'd to allow text searching and copying - this should  prove very\nuseful for the retro archivist who'd like to have their own local\nsearchable archive. They look great on most PDF readers, including the\niPad.\n\nAs Amiga Shopper followed a fairly plain and simple layout, the OCR\nsoftware hasn't had too many problem parsing the content. I've had to\ntrim the edges of most of the issues to get them to scan, but mostly\nthis has just resulted in a page number or the edge of an advert being\nlost. Some of the pages are slightly skewed - this is combination of the\noriginal pages being similarly skewed, and a slip of the knife when\ntrimming the pages. Everything should be very readable though - there's\nmore details (and pictures!) of the process on the RetroPDFs blog.\n\nMore OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please check\n(or Google RetroPDFs) for more\ninformation.\n\nThanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site\n(www.worldofspectrum.org), and all the visitors and donators to\nRetroPDFs for their support.\n\n90's style &quot;greets&quot; to anyone formally or currently involved in the\nAmiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat\nWill, Torch, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD\nGrapevine.
