Fashion magazines instruct women how to 'look ten years younger,' 'cover up wrinkles,' or get fuller, plumper lips'. And even make-up products themselves play off women's insecurities, promising to conceal perceived flaws, define cheekbones, or make eyelashes fuller and longer. The underlying message? That there's something inherently wrong with the way women look and that they have to spend time, money, and energy keeping up with all the ways they should 'fix' themselves.\n In GET POSITIVELY BEAUTIFUL, Carmindy teaches women how to change their mindset from so-called 'flaws' created by the beauty industry, to a positive beauty philosophy. Women learn how to find and focus on their best features and how to combat negative thoughts about their appearance. Using makeover photos by renowned fashion photographer Troy Ward, Carmindy demonstrates easy make-up techniques for eyes, brows, lashes, lips, cheeks and skin, and how to adapt looks to different weather conditions and 'beauty moods.' A shopping list gives her top high- and low-end beauty products.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to Tie a Scarf: 33 Styles\n\nPublisher: Potter Style \nPotter Style\nEnglish  \nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0385344988\nISBN-13: 978-0385344982\nOct 2013 \nEPUB \n128 pages \n20,7 MB\n\nFrom designer silk squares to chunky homemade knits, this guide is filled with inspired ways to style your scarves.
