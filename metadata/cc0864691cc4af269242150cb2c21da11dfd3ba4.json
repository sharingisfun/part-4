From udon to soba and from reshteh to rice vermicelli, the widely travelled world of the noodle is celebrated in delicious stir-fries, soups, sauces, salads and snacks. Full of intoxicating and bewitching flavours, Noodle! is both an essential recipe collection and a fascinating culinary masterclass.\n\nNoodle! is the fifth book in a series that began with the bestselling Mince! (World Gourmand Award for 'Best UK Single Subject Cookbook') and continued with the brilliant titles Stew!, Soup!, and Pie!.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02929/mimiaye_2929258e.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02929/mimiaye_2929258e.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nMiMi Aye was born at the English seaside, but brought up with Burmese sensibilities. Having read Law at Cambridge, she qualified as a solicitor at a top City law firm before going into publishing.\nAn obsession with food, especially Burmese cuisine, led to MiMi starting the food blog &quot;meemalee's kitchen&quot; where she shares her culinary thoughts, recipes and reviews. Due to her eloquent and often wry turn of phrase, her blog is now popular worldwide, although particularly in the Netherlands for reasons she has never been able to fathom.\n&quot;meemalee's kitchen&quot; is a stalwart of Wikio's Top Gastronomy Blogs, and has been mentioned or featured in the Sunday Times, Guardian, BBC Good Food online, Serious Eats and HELLO!, as well as on renowned Asian food blog EatingAsia. Her recipes can be found on the Channel Four website and in the Guardian Cook supplement.\nMiMi lives in Kent with her husband and a collection of gashapon. Her first book, NOODLE!, will be published by Absolute Press in 2014. \n\nCONTENTS\nIntroduction\nStir-fries\nSoups\nSauces\nSalads \nSnacks\nGlossary &amp; Stocklists\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc0864691cc4af269242150cb2c21da11dfd3ba4","amp;dn":"Noodle%21+-+100+Amazing+Authentic+Recipes+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc0864691cc4af269242150cb2c21da11dfd3ba4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,8,100,105,28,196,175,38,146,66,21,12,178,194,29,161,29,253,59,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
