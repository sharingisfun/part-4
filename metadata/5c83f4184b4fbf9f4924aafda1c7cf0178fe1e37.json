The high school friends started out as an acoustic act, but after meeting Sean Huber (drums) and Ian Farmer (bass), they became a four-piece. Their debut record, Sports, gained local traction and eventually, in 2013, online buzz started to pick up for their lo-fi songs, which captured the awkwardness of teenagers surrounded by social media. \r\n\r\n  The quartet remained at university while taking time out so they could to tour, but that changed when they were offered a support slot with fellow Philly-based outfit the Wonder Years. They soon penned a deal with Run for Cover Records and returned to the studio to record their follow-up, You're Gonna Miss It All, which appeared in 2014. An EP, MOBO Presents: The Perfect Cast EP featuring Modern Baseball, arrived in 2015 via Lame-O Records, with Holy Ghost, the band's third studio long player, arriving in May 2016. Having enlisted an outside producer for the first time in the shape of Joe Reinhardt, Holy Ghost saw them unleashing their inner stadium rockers to make their biggest, most epic-sounding record to date","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c83f4184b4fbf9f4924aafda1c7cf0178fe1e37","amp;dn":"Modern+Baseball+-+Holy+Ghost+%282016%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c83f4184b4fbf9f4924aafda1c7cf0178fe1e37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,131,244,24,75,79,191,159,73,36,170,253,161,199,207,1,120,254,30,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
