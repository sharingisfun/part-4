Known for its clear approach to teaching, the text is widely praised for its ability to break A&amp;P down into very simple, easy to understand language. Content is organized according to body systems, and focuses on the body working together to promote homeostasis. Improving both the quality and quantity of text illustrations, the Fourth Editionâ€™s new art program brings text concepts to life with new figures throughout. Designed specifically for the needs of health care programs, the all-new Learning Labâ€™s interactive simulation program helps learners maximize their success.\r\n\r\nFeatures and Benefits:\r\n\r\n- Written specifically for health care students, this text presents even the most complex topics in simple, easy-to-understand language to ensure thorough student understanding. The text presumes no prior knowledge of biology or chemistryâ€”making it ideal for career college, high school and continuing education settings.\r\n- Giving students a real-world connection to chapter concepts, the Search and Explore feature goes beyond the textbook to expand the learning experience with key word Internet searches, suggested websites with related activities, and brief human interest projects that add a personal element to assignments.\r\n- Case Studies are included in each body system chapter to encourage hands-on application of concepts learned, promote critical thinking, and facilitate discussion.\r\nThe Study Guide Practice feature directs readers to even more learning tools, including practice questions, labeling and coloring exercises, and crossword puzzles.\r\n- Health Alert and Common Disease, Disorder, or Condition boxes help learners relate concepts to clinical practice.\r\n- Concept Maps for body system chapters illustrate the connections between anatomy and physiology of the organs of each body system.\r\n- Body Systems Working Together to Maintain Homeostasis helps learners see integration of separate systems into one body","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:791eb4738f0127cc79784b8ea5624ced87deb406","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Anatomy+and+Physiology%2C+4th+Edition+%5B2015%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"791eb4738f0127cc79784b8ea5624ced87deb406","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,30,180,115,143,1,39,204,121,120,75,142,165,98,76,237,135,222,180,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
