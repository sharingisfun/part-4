Not religiously, but regularly. I've still got a few of the TPB and a couple dozen issues in one of the long boxes. I didn't stop reading it for any reason in particular; I always enjoyed it, thought it had great humor and intelligence, and I liked Sakai's art, too. It just faded from my consciousness, and then all of a sudden (like, a decade later) I was over a hundred issues behind. Well, it recently came to my attention that the series is currently on hiatus while Sakai works on 47 Ronin with Mike Richardson. That being the case, this seemed like the perfect time to gather up all the Usagi I could find and get caught up so I can jump back on board when the series re-starts. As it turns out, I found everything (give or take a loose bit here and there).\n\nNow, to my eyes, most of these books are screaming for a restoration, but I'm going to refrain. One, because it would triple the size of this already large torrent. Two, I would rather spend the time gathering, scanning, downloading, compiling, restoring and uploading other books. If anybody REALLY wants a restored version, just leave the request in the comments and I'll put it on the to do list.\n\nLastly, this torrent is much larger than anything I've uploaded in the past. The reason for this is that I don't believe these larger torrents stay seeded for as long, or as heavily. So do me a favor and prove me wrong!\n\nWithout further annoying preamble from your friendly neighborhood Spock, this torrent contains...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBook 01 - The Ronin TPB\nBook 02 - Samurai V1 Issues 1-6\nBook 03 - The Wanderer's Road V1 Issues 7-12 plus TMNT Turtle Soup V1 Issue 1\nBook 04 - Dragon Bellow Conspiracy V1 Issues 13-18\nBook 05 - Lone Goat and Kid V1 Issues 19-24\nBook 06 - Circles TPB\nBook 07 - Gen's Story TPB\nBook 08 - Shades Of Death TPB\nBook 08 - Daisho TPB\nBook 10 - The Brink of Life and Death TPB\nBook 11 - Seasons TPB\nBook 12 - Grasscutter TPB\nBook 13 - Grey Shadows TPB\nBook 14 - Demon Mask TPB\nBook 15 - Grasscutter II Journey To Atsuta Shrine V3 Issues 39-45\nBook 16 - The Shrouded Moon V3 Issues 46-52\nBook 17 - Duel at Kitanoji V3 Issues 53-60\nBook 18 - Travels with Jotaro V3 Issues 61-68\nBook 19 - Fathers and Sons V3 Issues 69-75\nBook 20 - Glimpses Of Death V3 Issues 76-82\nBook 21 - The Mother Of Mountains V3 Issues 83-89\nBook 22 - Tomoe's Story V3 Issues 90-93 and Usagi Yojimbo Color Specials 1-3\nBook 23 - Bridge Of Tears V3 Issues 94-102\nBook 24 - Return of the Black Soul V3 Issues 103-109\nBook 25 - Fox Hunt V3 Issues 110-116 and Saya from MDHP 19\nBook 26 - Traitors of the Earth V3 Issues 117-123, Dark Horse Maverick 2001 and Cut The Plumb from MDHP 35\nBook 27 - A Town Called Hell V3 Issues 124-131\n\nOngoing - V3 Issues 132-144\n\nSpace Usagi TPB (Collects Issues 1-3 of Space Usagi Warrior, 1-3 of Space Usagi Death and Honor, 1-3 of Space Usagi White Star Rising, TMNT 47)\n\nUsagi Yojimbo - Yokai TPB\n\nUsagi Yojimbo Mescellay (Art of Usagi Yojimbo 02, Color Special 04, The Cooking Lesson (from Drawing The Line)\n\nMissing: Art of Usagi Yojimbo 01, Usagi Yojimbo FCBD 2009 and various small bits and pieces.\n\nPublished by Fantagraphics, Mirage and Dark Horse, 1984 to present\n\nWritten and Illustrated by Stan Sakai\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c2f9d675cb617f0628aaf6989905025086634d6","amp;dn":"Stan+Sakai+-+Usagi+Yojimbo+%28Complete+To+Date%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c2f9d675cb617f0628aaf6989905025086634d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,47,157,103,92,182,23,240,98,138,175,105,137,144,80,37,8,102,52,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
