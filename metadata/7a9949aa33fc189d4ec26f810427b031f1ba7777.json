Well, it&amp;#039;s not very normal and you can clearly hear the Chinese inspirations on this one. \nOf course, Gorillaz have also set their marks on the monkey-tastic musical, as well has The Good The Bad And The Queen. \nIf you were looking for ethnic monkey music, you&amp;#039;ve come to the right place.\n(btw, am I the only one that thinks the cover is kinda friggin scary?)\n\nTT: 50:00\n\nTracks:\n01.
