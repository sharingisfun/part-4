On the hits collection All World, all the phases are represented: he was &quot;hard as hell&quot; on 1986's &quot;Rock the Bells&quot; and again on 1991's &quot;Mama Said Knock You Out&quot;; on 1987's &quot;I Need Love,&quot; he was the painfully sappy precursor to Boyz II Men, but he had the formula down pat for 1990's &quot;Around the Way Girl&quot; (and then he went sappy again on 1995's &quot;Hey Lover,&quot; a collaboration with the Boyz); and 1988's &quot;Going Back to Cali&quot; found him stylin'. He's had his ups and downs and managed to produce only a couple of truly killer albums, but LL's first dozen years show that he's left his stamp on nearly every facet of the hip-hop world.\n\nDisc 01\n\n[01] I Can't Live Without My Radio\n[02] Rock The Bells\n[03] I'm Bad\n[04] I Need Love\n[05] Going Back To Cali\n[06] Jack The Ripper\n[07] Jingling Baby\n[08] Big Ole Butt\n[09] The Boomin' System\n[10] Around The Way Girl\n[11] Mama Said Knock You Out\n[12] Back Seat\n[13] I Need A Beat\n[14] Doin' It\n[15] Loungin (Who Do Ya Luv)\n[16] Hey Lover\t\t\t- Featuring Boyz II Men\n\n\n\tDisc 01 - Play Time - 01h:13m:10s\n\n\nDisc 02\n\n[01] Loungin (Summer Luv LP Mix)\n[02] Doin It (Main Mix)\n[03] Hey Lover (Street Mix) \t- Featuring Boyz II Men\n\n\tDisc 01 - Play Time - 00h:12m:39s\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 01h:25m:49s\n\nTotal Folder File Size\t- 202mb (Including mp3, Art Covers &amp; Booklet, word doc)\n\nTotal Mp3 Bit Rate \t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes 8.1.1.10 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nOriginal CD Ripper \t- only1joe\n\nOriginal CD Uploader\t- only1joe\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Hip Hop Rap\n\nOriginally Released\t- 05 November 1996\n\nRecords Company    \t- Def Jam Records\n\nArtists Website\t\t-\n\n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\nAny Errors In Torrents Or Music Files ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Leave A Comment On My Most Recent Torrent.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ffc14e9caa47cd6b542e40d6c5f4239a5cfbb04","amp;dn":"%5B1996%5D+All+World+Greatest+Hits+-+LL+Cool+J+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ffc14e9caa47cd6b542e40d6c5f4239a5cfbb04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,252,20,233,202,164,124,214,181,66,228,13,108,95,66,57,165,207,187,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
