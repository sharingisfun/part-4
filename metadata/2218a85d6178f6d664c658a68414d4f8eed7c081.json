The kompani exist in many places, living quietly in the shadows, thriving off the bounty that others have no wit to secure, nor skill to defend. Their private history is unwritten; their recall rooted in dance and dream. The Clan Korval is in many ways the opposite of the kompani. The interstellar trading clan is wealthy in enemies, and fortunate in friends. Korval protects itself with vigor, and teaches even its youngest children the art of war.\n\nAnd when representatives of Clan Korval arrive on the planet Surebleak where the kompani has lived, secret and aloof, the lives of three people intersect - Kezzi, apprentice to the kompani's grandmother; Syl Vor, Clan Korval's youngest warrior; and Rys, a man without a world, or a past.\n\nNecessity's Child is a standalone adventure in the popular and exciting Liaden Universe.\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Eileen Stevens\nLength: 11 hrs and 54 mins \nFormat: M4A\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged Audiobook\nRelease Date:02-05-13\nPublisher: Audible Studios","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2218a85d6178f6d664c658a68414d4f8eed7c081","amp;dn":"Sharon+Lee%2C+Steve+Miller+-+Necessity%27s+Child+%28Liaden+%2316%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2218a85d6178f6d664c658a68414d4f8eed7c081","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,24,168,93,97,120,246,214,100,198,88,166,132,20,212,248,238,215,192,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
