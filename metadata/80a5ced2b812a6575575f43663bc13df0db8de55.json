Various techniques for constructing parallel programs are explored in detail. Case studies demonstrate the development process, which begins with computational thinking and ends with effective and efficient parallel programs. Topics of performance, floating-point format, parallel patterns, and dynamic parallelism are covered in depth.\n\nThis best-selling guide to CUDA and GPU parallel programming has been revised with more parallel programming examples, commonly-used libraries such as Thrust, and explanations of the latest tools. With these improvements, the book retains its concise, intuitive, practical approach based on years of road-testing in the authors own parallel computing courses.\n\nUpdates in this new edition include:\n\nNew coverage of CUDA 5.0, improved performance, enhanced development tools, increased hardware support, and more\nIncreased coverage of related technology, OpenCL and new material on algorithm patterns, GPU clusters, host programming, and data parallelism\nTwo new case studies (on MRI reconstruction and molecular visualization) explore the latest applications of CUDA and GPUs for scientific research and high-performance computing\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nChapter 1.
