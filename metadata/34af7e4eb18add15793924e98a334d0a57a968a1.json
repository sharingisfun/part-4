This course describes how to read and manage data from relational databases such as MySQL and SQL Server using the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API.\n\nAuthor David Gassner explains how to choose a JDBC driver and connect to one or more databases. He also provides detailed instructions on reading, selecting, and updating data; calling stored procedures; managing data via JavaBean classes or with prepared statements; and working with metadata.\n\nTopics include:\nImporting a MySQL database\nConnecting to databases\nHandling JDBC exceptions\nLooping through result sets\nLimiting the number of fetched rows\nFiltering data with prepared statements\nCalling stored procedures\nInserting, updating, and deleting rows with prepared statements\nUsing a persistent database connection\nCommitting and rolling back transactions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34af7e4eb18add15793924e98a334d0a57a968a1","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+Java+Database+Integration+with+JDBC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34af7e4eb18add15793924e98a334d0a57a968a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,175,126,78,177,138,221,21,121,57,36,233,138,51,77,10,87,169,104,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
