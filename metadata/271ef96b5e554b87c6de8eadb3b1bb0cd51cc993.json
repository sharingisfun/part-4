No matter your budget or style, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be inspired by stories of everyday women with busy lives and limited budgets who have infused personal values, meaning, and style into making their own Ã¢â‚¬Å“sweet spotÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ homes. Instead of feeling overwhelmed you will feel inspired as you see how other women like you have done it. You will develop your own sense of style by making a mood board and will have access to loads of resources, both online and off, so that you can create an environment that reflects who you are and what you want, so you can draw more of that into your life.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:271ef96b5e554b87c6de8eadb3b1bb0cd51cc993","amp;dn":"Desha+Peacock+-+Create+the+Style+You+Crave+on+a+Budget+You+Can+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"271ef96b5e554b87c6de8eadb3b1bb0cd51cc993","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,30,249,107,94,85,75,135,198,222,142,173,179,177,187,12,213,28,201,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
