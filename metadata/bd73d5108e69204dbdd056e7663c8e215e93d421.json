While the stakes might not be as high for a jazz band improvising in a recording studio or in front of a live audience, Spyro Gyra's leader and saxophonist Jay Beckenstein understands the passion that drives a person and makes &quot;life on the wire&quot; so appealing. Their new album, Down the Wire is a snapshot of Spyro Gyra's enduring dedication to walk along that wire.\n\nFor more than three decades, they have maintained a position at the forefront of modern jazz by successfully managing not just one, but several feats of creative dexterity. &quot;That's what has kept this band going,&quot; says Beckenstein. &quot;There are always balances to be found - between the individual player and the group, between the songwriter and the player. It's about both satisfying yourself and satisfying your audience. And when you're improvising in front of a crowd, you're really walking down that wire. There are always surprises that way, but our openness to those surprises is what makes this band what it is. We just happen to be walking on a slightly more forgiving tightrope.&quot;\n\nAsked where Down The Wire belongs in Spyro Gyra's substantial legacy, Beckenstein is quick to reply. &quot;You know, everybody up on the wire knows one thing for sure,&quot; Beckenstein laughs. &quot;The real trouble comes if you start looking behind you. The future's in front of you.&quot;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd73d5108e69204dbdd056e7663c8e215e93d421","amp;dn":"Spyro+Gyra+-+Down+The+Wire+%282009%29+%5Bmp3%40196%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd73d5108e69204dbdd056e7663c8e215e93d421","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,115,213,16,142,105,32,77,189,208,86,231,102,60,142,33,94,147,212,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
