The group took the blues-rock sound of late '60s acts like Cream, Blue Cheer, and Vanilla Fudge to its logical conclusion, slowing the tempo, accentuating the bass, and emphasizing screaming guitar solos and howled vocals full of lyrics expressing mental anguish and macabre fantasies. If their predecessors clearly came out of an electrified blues tradition, Black Sabbath took that tradition in a new direction, and in so doing helped give birth to a musical style that continued to attract millions of fans decades later.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.War Pigs/Luke's Wall\n02.Paranoid\n03.Planet Caravan\n04.Iron Man\n05.Electric Funeral\n06.Hand Of Doom\n07.Rat Salad\n08.Jack The Stripper/Fairies Wear Boots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a89a798cd65b4fdf418503a51ffec2900bc702c","amp;dn":"Black+Sabbath+-+Paranoid+%281987%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a89a798cd65b4fdf418503a51ffec2900bc702c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,137,167,152,205,101,180,253,244,24,80,58,81,255,236,41,0,188,112,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
