He won U.S. National Book Awards in 1971 and 1982.\n\nGenre: Children's fantasy\n\n\nThe Book of Three:\n\nSince The Book of Three was first published in 1964, young readers have been enthralled by the adventures of Taran the Assistant Pig-Keeper and his quest to become a hero. Taran is joined by an engaging cast of characters that includes Eilonwy, the strong-willed and sharp-tongued princess; Fflewddur Fflam, the hyperbole-prone bard; the ever-faithful Gurgi; and the curmudgeonly Doli--all of whom have become involved in an epic struggle between good and evil that shapes the fate of the legendary land of Prydain.\n\nThe Black Cauldron:\n\n&quot;What happens next?&quot; is always an urgent question, and this volume attempts to answer it, at least partially. Nevertheless, The Black Cauldron should stand as a chronicle in its own right. Certain matters previously hinted at are here revealed more fully; and, while extending the story, I have also tried to deepen it.\nIf a darker thread runs through the high spirits, it is because the happenings are of serious import not only to the Land of Prydain but to Taran, the Assistant Pig-Keeper, himself. Although an imaginary world, Prydain is essentially not too different from our real one, where humor and heartbreak, joy and sadness are closely interwoven. The choices and decisions that face a frequently baffled Assistant Pig-Keeper are no easier than the ones we ourselves must make. Even in a fantasy realm, growing up is accomplished not without cost.\n\nThe Castle Llyr:\n\nThe Castle of Llyr is, in a sense, more romantic than the preceding chroniclesÃ¢â‚¬â€¢ Taran is noticeably aware of his feelings toward Eilonwy. And it is sometimes more comicÃ¢â‚¬â€¢ for example, the utter despair of the companions in trying to cope with the well-meaning but hapless Prince Rhun. The mood, perhaps, is bittersweet rather than grandly heroic. But the adventure should hold something beyond the fairy-tale elements of a magic golden bauble, a vengeful queen, a mysterious castle, and rivals for the hand of a princess. The nature of fantasy allows happenings which reveal most clearly our own frailties and our own strengths.\n\nTaran Wanderer:\n\nThis fourth chronicle of Prydain begins as a gallant, high-hearted quest, which soon becomes more intense and perhaps more essentially heroic than the preceding adventures. For here, Taran comes to grips with a merciless opponent: the truth about himself. No longer as Taran Assistant Pig-Keeper but as Taran Wanderer, he learns to reshape his life out of his own inner resources; for there must not only be an end to childhood but also a beginning of manhood. This is meant to be a serious taleÃ¢â‚¬â€¢ in the way that all humor is serious and all fantasy trueÃ¢â‚¬â€¢ and if there is no conventionally happy ending in fairy-tale terms, there is still a most hopeful ending in human terms.\n\nThe High King:\n\nAlthough it deals with a battle on an epic scale, where Taran, Princess Eilonwy, Fflewddur Fflam, even the oracular pig Hen Wen, are pressed to the limits of their strength, it is a battle whose aftermath is deeper in consequences than the struggle itself. The final choice, which even faithful Gurgi cannot avoid, is almost too hard to bear. Fortunately, it is never offered to us in the real worldÃ¢â‚¬â€¢ not, at least, in such unmistakable terms. In another sense, we face this kind of choice again and again, because for us it is never final. Whether the Assistant Pig-Keeper chose well, whether the ending is happy, heartbreaking, or both, readers must decide for themselves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7aca69b9d79b966f25452a2dba3cc0370a1c501","amp;dn":"Chronicles+of+Prydain+by+Lloyd+Alexander+%28Books+1-5%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7aca69b9d79b966f25452a2dba3cc0370a1c501","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,172,166,155,157,121,185,102,242,84,82,162,219,163,204,3,112,161,197,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
