It is an alternate version of the album titled 20 Greatest Hits in most of the world. Due to timing problems, EMI included a three-track bonus EP (A-980), with the 20-track LP. The cassette version contains all 23 tracks as cassettes do not have the length limitations which LPs have. The album spent one week at the top of the Australian album charts in 1983.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:24\n    &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:55\n    &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:11\n    &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:33\n    &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:44\n    &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:10\n    &quot;Help!&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:18\n    &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:15\n    &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:44\n    &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:38\n    &quot;Penny Lane&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:59\n    &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:47\n    &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:27\n    &quot;Lady Madonna&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:16\n    &quot;Hey Jude&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:04\n    &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:07\n    &quot;Get Back&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:12\n    &quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:59\n    &quot;Something&quot; (Harrison) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:01\n    &quot;Let It Be&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:50\n\nBonus EP \n\n    &quot;Love Me Do&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:20\n    &quot;I Feel Fine&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:18\n    &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; (Berry) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:30\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9853256de39dffaa5dcd1b0ba4e8ec77ddf759d9","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+The+Number+Ones+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9853256de39dffaa5dcd1b0ba4e8ec77ddf759d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,83,37,109,227,157,255,170,93,205,27,11,164,232,236,119,221,247,89,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
