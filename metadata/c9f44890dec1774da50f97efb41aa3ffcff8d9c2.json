Oddly enough, the Reflektor and the Her score we conceived somewhat simultaneously Ã¢â‚¬â€œ album track Ã¢â‚¬ËœSupersymmetryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was written specifically for the film Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but Her also features plenty of original music. Helped out by regular collaborator Owen Pallett (aka Final Fantasy), the material shimmers beautifully alongside JonzeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sombre and oftentimes chilling statement on love in the digital age.\nJonze explained that Arcade Fire simultaneously worked on the score and Reflektor, and that Ã¢â‚¬Å“SupersymmetryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was originally written with the film in mind. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Win [Butler] and I started talking about the score about two years ago, and then it kinda seemed like the record sort of informed the soundtrack and the soundtrack informed the record a little bit, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like a song on [Reflektor]Ã¢â‚¬â€the last one, Ã¢â‚¬ËœSupersymmetryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬â€that he wrote for the movie, but then it sort of became something else. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actually the last song in the end credits.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nHer stars Joaquin Phoenix as a man who falls in love with an intelligent computer operating system named Samathana (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). When it came to the soundtrack, Jonze said they wanted Ã¢â‚¬Å“for it not to feel synthetic, but to feel like hand-made, but still have an electricity to it, and also just to sort of play this sort of romance and love story and longing of [Phoenix's character] Theodore.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9f44890dec1774da50f97efb41aa3ffcff8d9c2","amp;dn":"Arcade+Fire+-+Her+OST+%2B+FYC+Promo+Bonus+Disc+%282013%29+FLAC+Beolab1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9f44890dec1774da50f97efb41aa3ffcff8d9c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,244,72,144,222,193,119,77,165,15,151,239,180,26,163,255,207,248,217,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
