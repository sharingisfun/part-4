Despite being both loathed and loved by the local masses, Dave is a guy who doesn't seem to have it all together, and in this film, he begins to feel it. An attractive job offer presents Dave with a major question: to pursue his career in New York City, or to remain at home with his family.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cdn.piczend.com/images/jujkUw3a/lndgx2uey6yfqbav3d90e1znm.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cdn.piczend.com/images/jujkUw3a/lndgx2uey6yfqbav3d90e1znm.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cdn.piczend.com/images/jujkUw3a/9y6ws78wbeutzyhvnnmod7hg7.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cdn.piczend.com/images/jujkUw3a/9y6ws78wbeutzyhvnnmod7hg7.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1784a778b2a9148bceeca8b89c44adf7b7024cdd","amp;dn":"The+Weather+Man+%282005%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1784a778b2a9148bceeca8b89c44adf7b7024cdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,132,167,120,178,169,20,139,206,236,168,184,156,68,173,247,183,2,76,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
