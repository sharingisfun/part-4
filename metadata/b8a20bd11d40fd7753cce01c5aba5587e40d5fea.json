The other one is not working.\n\nPHP for Web Designers\n5h 26m Beginner Dec 09, 2013\n\n\n\nThere are many great reasons to learn PHP. You can reduce manual updates to webpages, get user input, and connect to a database of products or other information. But some web designers are intimidated by the theory and jargon. PHP for Web Designers is different. Author David Powers provides a gentle introduction to PHP, through a series of simple exercises that help you develop fully functional dynamic webpagesÃ¢â‚¬â€all powered by PHP. Learn how to reduce website maintenance by moving common page elements to external server-side include files, change content automatically depending on the date or time, display alternate text, gather user input from a form, and link to a database to display product information. The final chapter is dedicated to understanding error messages and fixing their root causes.\n\nNote: This course was recorded with Adobe Dreamweaver, but you can use the code editor of your choice to follow along.\nTopics include:\n\n    How to use PHP in a webpage\n    Storing and displaying text and numbers in variables\n    Using functions\n    Adding comments to your PHP scripts\n    Moving common page elements to include files\n    Displaying different content on a page\n    Working with multiple values in arrays and loops\n    Getting form input sent by the POST method\n    Using PHP sessions to preserve data\n    Storing data in session variables\n    Connecting to and querying a database\n    Handling errors","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8a20bd11d40fd7753cce01c5aba5587e40d5fea","amp;dn":"Lynda-+PHP+for+Web+Designers+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8a20bd11d40fd7753cce01c5aba5587e40d5fea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,162,11,209,29,64,253,119,83,204,224,28,90,186,85,135,228,13,95,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
