Nearly every page is organized around maps and other figures (many in full color) that illustrate all aspects of map making, including instructive examples of both good and poor design choices. The book covers everything from locating and processing data to making decisions about layout, symbols, color, and type. Readers are invited to think critically about both the technical features and social significance of maps as they learn to create better maps of their own.\n\nNew to This Edition\n*Extensively revised and expanded core chapters on map design.\n*An annotated map design exemplar is used to show how the concepts in each chapter play out on an actual map.\n*Updated to reflect current technological developments.\n*Larger size and redesigned pages make the book even more user friendly.\n\nAbout the Authors\nJohn Krygier teaches in the Department of Geology and Geography at Ohio Wesleyan University, with teaching and research specializations in cartography, geographic information systems (GIS), and environmental and human geography. He has published on map design, educational technology, cultural geography, multimedia in cartography, planning, the history of cartography, and participatory GIS.\nDenis Wood curated the award-winning Power of Maps exhibition for the Smithsonian and writes widely about maps. A former professor of design at North Carolina State University, Wood is a currently an independent scholar living in Raleigh, North Carolina.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31499dd07074777224a76b4dc332f141f2b54a5b","amp;dn":"Making+Maps+-+A+Visual+Guide+to+Map+Design+for+GIS+%282nd+Ed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31499dd07074777224a76b4dc332f141f2b54a5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,73,157,208,112,116,119,114,36,167,107,77,195,50,241,65,242,181,74,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
