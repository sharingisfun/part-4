A Love For All Time\n\nEven Camper Van BeethovenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬â„¢80s fans Ã¢â‚¬â€ whoever was left in the mid-00s Ã¢â‚¬â€ never expected the band to roar back with one of its finest releases, 2004Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s New Roman Times. Eight years later frontman David Lowery puts his long time Cracker project on hold for this terrific follow-up. The songs are loosely connected with a somewhat disjointed conceptual thread based on the north coast of California, where CVB was formed. Anyone familiar with the wildly eclectic mix of indie rock, Tex-Mex, psychedelia, prog, ska and world music that created CVBÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique sound will be thrilled with this older, wiser and somewhat less frantic version. The album was partially recorded with all the members playing together in multi-instrumentalist Jonathan SegelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home studio. That may explain SegelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s higher profile, with an emphasis on his mournful violin, since he is a major component throughout the disc. LoweryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s typically dry, heavy-lidded singing remains front and center and there is no doubt that these are CVB not Cracker songs. Some editing would have helped as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Northern California GirlsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ clocks in at over seven minutes yet is interesting for half of that, and the thought-provoking title of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Someday Our Love Will Sell Us OutÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ gets diluted when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s repeated too often during its five-minute length. But LoweryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s offbeat, playfully obtuse lyrics are in full flower on the trippy Ã¢â‚¬Å“Too High for the Love-In.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The band expertly navigates unusual, sometimes radical mood changes, with a maturity that forsakes some of its youthful friskiness without compromising an idiosyncratic vision that is just as compelling today as it was 25 years ago.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:197e8c3ecd7354d4ffe2dc3dfd6ba75df9e00b9c","amp;dn":"Camper+Van+Beethoven+-+La+Costa+Perdida+%5B2013%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"197e8c3ecd7354d4ffe2dc3dfd6ba75df9e00b9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,126,140,62,205,115,84,212,255,226,220,61,253,107,167,93,249,224,11,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
