Born into an elite family in one of the Republic's wealthiest districts, fifteen-year-old June is a prodigy being groomed for success in the Republic's highest military circles. Born into the slums, fifteen-year-old Day is the country's most wanted criminal. But his motives may not be as malicious as they seem.\n\nFrom very different worlds, June and Day have no reason to cross paths - until the day June's brother, Metias, is murdered and Day becomes the prime suspect. Caught in the ultimate game of cat and mouse, Day is in a race for his family's survival, while June seeks to avenge Metias's death. But in a shocking turn of events, the two uncover the truth of what has really brought them together, and the sinister lengths their country will go to keep its secrets.\n\nProdigy (Legend #2)\n\nInjured and on the run, it has been seven days since June and Day barely escaped Los Angeles and the Republic with their lives. Day is believed dead having lost his own brother to an execution squad who thought they were assassinating him. June is now the Republic's most wanted traitor. Desperate for help, they turn to the Patriots - a vigilante rebel group sworn to bring down the Republic. But can they trust them or have they unwittingly become pawns in the most terrifying of political games?\n\nChampion (Legend #3)\n\nHe is a Legend.\n\nShe is a Prodigy.\n\nWho will be Champion?\n\nJune and Day have sacrificed so much for the people of the RepublicÃ¢â‚¬â€and each otherÃ¢â‚¬â€and now their country is on the brink of a new existence. June is back in the good graces of the Republic, working within the governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elite circles as Princeps-Elect, while Day has been assigned a high-level military position.\n\nBut neither could have predicted the circumstances that will reunite them: just when a peace treaty is imminent, a plague outbreak causes panic in the Colonies, and war threatens the RepublicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s border cities. This new strain of plague is deadlier than ever, and June is the only one who knows the key to her countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s defense. But saving the lives of thousands will mean asking the one she loves to give up everything.\n\nWith heart-pounding action and suspense, Marie LuÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bestselling trilogy draws to a stunning conclusion.\n\n\n---\n\n\nRead by Mariel Stern, Steven Kaplan\nFormat: MP3\nUnabridged\n\nRead by Mariel Stern, Steven Kaplan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66c6f8a801b7cb861f946efccc821a44331dcf63","amp;dn":"Marie+Lu+-+Legend+Trilogy+Set+%28Legend+%231-3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66c6f8a801b7cb861f946efccc821a44331dcf63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,198,248,168,1,183,203,134,31,148,110,252,204,130,26,68,51,29,207,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
