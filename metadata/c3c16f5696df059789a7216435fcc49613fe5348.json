Over the course of 28 cuts, she runs the emotional gamut from summery optimism (&quot;Love Is Here to Stay&quot;) to pathos-rich musings (&quot;Ill Wind&quot;). Befitting her perennial after-hours mood while at the label, the majority of songs here feature Holiday in a low-down mood of the highest order: her versions of &quot;Moonlight in Vermont&quot; and &quot;A Foggy Day&quot; are classics of the jazz vocal tradition. And the supporting cast isn't bad either, what with the likes of Harry Eddison, Barney Kessel, Ben Webster, and Jimmy Rowles tagging along. A gem.
