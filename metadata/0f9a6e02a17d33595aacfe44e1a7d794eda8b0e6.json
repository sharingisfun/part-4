Either way, this is a great piece of music. Curtis Mayfield had a musical career which spanned decades, and moved from the gospel roots of the Impressions to the soundtrack of a movie which glorified drug dealing. Social sensibilities aside, it is hard to say anything bad about this music. Curtis' voice was sweet and plaintive in songs like &quot;Eddie, you Should've Known Better&quot;, and &quot;Little Child, Running Wild&quot;. Of course, he is like a one man Greek Chorus, as his songs tell of the strife which the movie characters face with their life's choices. Songs like &quot;Superfly&quot; and of course Freddie's Dead let us know via the radio what was happening on the screen. This album is still as fresh today as it was 25 years ago. \n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
