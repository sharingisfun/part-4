Jack Lemmon is John Gustafson, an ice-fishing Minnesota native who has been feuding with his neighbor and former best friend Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) for decades. The battle of wills between John and Max is characterized by crude name calling and harmless practical jokes. Max is unaware that John is having serious problems, chiefly that his daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) is experiencing marital woes and that his house is about to be confiscated by an officious IRS agent (Buck Henry). When it seems that John and Max may finally put aside their childish rivalry, however, sexy new neighbor Ariel (Ann-Margret) arrives and dates both men, pitting them against each other more fiercely than ever before. Despite their mutual loathing, the death of a friend, John's problems, and a budding romance between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie may force the two old friends to reconcile. \n\nRipped with Autogk.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 44 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d19de209e0df68cbee7f03599b46b1235ef4bcc","amp;dn":"Grumpy+Old+Men%281993%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d19de209e0df68cbee7f03599b46b1235ef4bcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,25,222,32,158,13,246,140,190,231,240,53,153,180,107,18,53,239,75,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
