His unique musical influences have resulted in a sound that fuses the singer-songwriter tradition with Eastern scales and rhythms, all rooted in a dance-club groove.\n\nAll of the sounds on Charmed and Strange and, for the most part, on A Foolproof Escape Plan were created on the acoustic guitar, all drums, bass, keyboard and piano sounds were beaten and dragged out of his trusty Lowden acoustic. The live performance follows the same route, with the help of several loop stations and YoavÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unusually hand-like feet.\n\nTrue to his reputation as global citizen, Yoav spent 2009 writing songs in London, South Africa, and Venice Beach, California, collaborating with a mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lange of musicians and artists from around the world to add to the richness of his sound. Joey Waronker ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the outstanding American music producer and drummer who has worked with Thom Yorke, Beck, Smashing Pumpkins, and R.E.M. - took the producerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s chair.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edbfe5efbc92fcee983dd1f7f6ff7fbdca97007a","amp;dn":"Yoav%3A+A+Foolproof+Escape+Plan+2010%28320%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edbfe5efbc92fcee983dd1f7f6ff7fbdca97007a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,191,229,239,188,146,252,238,152,61,209,247,246,255,127,189,202,151,0,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
