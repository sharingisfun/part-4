With forays into evolutionary biology, this analysis of mental function answers some of our most common questions about how we've come to be who we are. The book is published by Harvard University Press.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1733e2af5318184fdc6ac34cfb943aa3253472fd","amp;dn":"David+J.+Linden+-+The+Accidental+Mind_+How+Brain+Evolution+Has+G","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1733e2af5318184fdc6ac34cfb943aa3253472fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,51,226,175,83,24,24,79,220,106,195,76,251,148,58,163,37,52,114,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
