The film is based on the Marquis de Sade\\&amp;#039;s novel \\&quot;120 Days of Sodom\\&quot;, with the setting transposed to Mussolini\\&amp;#039;s miniature Fascist Republic of SalÃƒÂ², Italy in 1944.\n\nThe film\\&amp;#039;s content and imagry is extreme, and it retains the power to shock, repel and distress a quarter of a century on.  SalÃƒÂ² remains a cinematic milestone -- culturally significant, politically vital and visually stunning.\n\n\\&amp;#039;Pasolini\\&amp;#039;s final feature has emerged to appal a new generation grown complacent on consumerism and passive on permissiveness\\&amp;#039;\n***** Empire\n\n\\&amp;#039;a fearsome work of art\\&amp;#039;  What\\&amp;#039;s On\n\n\\&amp;#039;still relevant, still troubling\\&amp;#039;  Time Out\n\n\n[IMG]http://img82.imageshack.us/img82/2315/salo19ci.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://img82.imageshack.us/img82/3680/salo22zg.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://img82.imageshack.us/img82/7963/salo34gi.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\nWILL ONLY SEED THIS MAX 2:1 SO DONT JUMP OFF THIS AS SOON AS YOU FINISH","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8192ee22bcebbf6e7ccaf45b70cd0347427974ac","amp;dn":"Sal%C3%B2+o+le+120+giornate+di+Sodoma+AKA+Salo%2C+or+The+120+Days+of+So","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8192ee22bcebbf6e7ccaf45b70cd0347427974ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,146,238,34,188,235,191,110,124,202,244,91,112,205,3,71,66,121,116,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
