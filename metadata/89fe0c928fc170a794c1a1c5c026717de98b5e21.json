Simon's fame, influence and commercial success began as part of the duo Simon &amp; Garfunkel, formed in 1964 with musical partner Art Garfunkel. Simon wrote most of the pair's songs, including three that reached No. 1 on the U.S. singles charts: &quot;The Sound of Silence,&quot; &quot;Mrs. Robinson,&quot; and &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water.&quot;[1] The duo split up in 1970 at the height of their popularity, and Simon began a successful solo career as a guitarist and singer-songwriter, recording three highly acclaimed albums over the next five years.[2] In 1986, he released Graceland, an album inspired by South African township music. Simon also wrote and starred in the film One-Trick Pony (1980) and co-wrote the Broadway musical The Capeman (1998) with the poet Derek Walcott.[3]\n\nSimon has earned 12 Grammys for his solo and collaborative work, including the Lifetime Achievement Award.[4] In 2001, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame[5] and in 2006 was selected as one of the &quot;100 People Who Shaped the World&quot; by Time magazine.[6] Among many other honors, Simon was the first recipient of the Library of Congress' Gershwin Prize for Popular Song in 2007.[7] In 1986 Simon was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Music degree from Berklee College of Music where he currently serves on the Board of Trustees. \n\n\nGraceland 1986 (Remastered 2004)\n\n\nGraceland is the seventh studio album by American folk musician Paul Simon, released in August 1986.\n\nIt was a hit, topping the UK Album Chart, and reaching number three on the US Billboard 200. The album won the 1986 Grammy Award for Album of the Year, while the title song won the 1987 Grammy for Record of the Year. In 2007, the album was added to the United States National Recording Registry, along with another 24 significant recordings that year. It is included in many &quot;best of&quot; and &quot;greatest&quot; album lists including both Rolling Stone's[1] and Time's.\n\nComing at a time when Simon's musical career was at something of a low ebb following the disappointing public response to Hearts and Bones, the project was originally inspired by Simon's listening to a cassette of the Boyoyo Boys instrumental &quot;Gumboots.&quot; Simon later wrote lyrics to sing over a re-recording of the song, which became the fourth track on the album.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;The Boy in the Bubble&quot; \n2.\t&quot;Graceland&quot; \n3.\t&quot;I Know What I Know&quot; \n4.\t&quot;Gumboots&quot; \n5.\t&quot;Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes&quot; \n6.\t&quot;You Can Call Me Al&quot; \n7.\t&quot;Under African Skies&quot; \n8.\t&quot;Homeless&quot; \n9.\t&quot;Crazy Love, Vol. II&quot; \n10.\t&quot;That Was Your Mother&quot; \n11.\t&quot;All Around the World or the Myth of Fingerprints&quot; \n12.\t&quot;Homeless&quot; (demo version)\n13.\t&quot;Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes&quot; (alternate version)\n14.\t&quot;All Around the World or the Myth of Fingerprints&quot; (early version)\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89fe0c928fc170a794c1a1c5c026717de98b5e21","amp;dn":"Paul+Simon+-+Graceland+1986+%28Reissued+2004%29+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89fe0c928fc170a794c1a1c5c026717de98b5e21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,254,12,146,143,193,112,167,148,193,161,197,192,38,113,125,233,139,94,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
