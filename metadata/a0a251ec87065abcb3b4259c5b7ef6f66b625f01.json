Ane BrunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful reverb soaked voice dominates proceedings with the sibilant hiss of the artistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice echoing and receding into the isolated textures created within, beautifully contrasting the warm sound of the accompanying acoustic guitar. From the beginning BrunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s individualistic presence and style is set centre stage.\nContinuing with stunningly subtle renditions of the Beatles Ã¢â‚¬ËœFrom Me To YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s alright (BabyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coming back)Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ by the Eurythmics, Rarities highlights Ane BrunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to strip these songs back to their core and reinterpret the meaning or the musicality of the compositions in her own unique way, whether it be the electronic sparseness of the Eurythmics or the jangling rock Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll of the early Beatles recordings.\nThe highlight of Rarities comes from Ã¢â‚¬ËœPetrified Forest RoadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. A departure sonically from the quieter sections of the compilation, Ã¢â‚¬ËœPetrified Forest RoadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s percussive rumble and crashing aesthetic introduce an urgency to BrunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music. Infused with a sense of atmosphere and purpose, Ane BrunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s distinctive vocal never seems lost or out-of-place within the ever evolving textures of the recordingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s production.\nFull of hidden gems and interesting interpretations, Rarities is an album that showcases the talent and artistry of Ane Brun perfectly. Although the record could be seen as aimed at die-hard fans of the musician, the eclectic sound of Rarities can also work as an introduction to BrunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s atmospheric, fiercely independent music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0a251ec87065abcb3b4259c5b7ef6f66b625f01","amp;dn":"Ane+Brun+-+Rarities+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0a251ec87065abcb3b4259c5b7ef6f66b625f01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,162,81,236,135,6,90,188,179,180,37,156,91,126,246,246,107,98,95,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
