A jibe about someone's wife precipitates a blood feud between two families, to be carried cyclically in a town where every man carries a gun. (The jovial Comic Relief Guy removes his coat to reveal a pistol on his belt, which his mom insists he carry along with an amulet of the Virgin Mary.) The river is deep and murky, people cross it either on the lam from the authorities or inside a coffin carried by a black canoe, the hero (Miguel Torruco) experiences it both ways; vendettas proliferate in the land, a &quot;litany of hate&quot; reviled by the benevolent patriarch (JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© ElÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­as Moreno) but shrugged by a colleague as &quot;cosas de hombre.&quot; As soon as Moreno's heart expires, the frail amnesty between Torruco and his nemesis (Victor Alcocer) is tested yet ruptures under the weight of familial expectations. The whole thing is recounted by Torruco's son (JoaquÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­n Cordero), a medical student with no stomach for brutality even when Alcocer's son (Jaime FernÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ndez) drops by to demand a showdown. BuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±uel presents &quot;honor,&quot; a word much abused by the characters, as a specious conceit that leads to the ludicrous rather than to the sublime when pursued -- Cordero with only his noggin sticking out of the iron-lung is smacked by FernÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ndez, he later returns the favor by flicking blood from his wounded hand onto the revenge-fixated man's startled face. The struggle between civilization and savagery here is too schematic and easily resolvable (the finale is a joke tossed off like Bergman's in The Virgin Spring), but BuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±uel sorts through it briskly and sharply en route to Ensayo de un Crimen, that great horror-comedy also dealing with our &quot;strange customs.&quot; With Columba DomÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­nguez, Humberto AlmazÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n, Silvia Derbez, and Carlos MartÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­nez Baena.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img5.imageshack.us/img5/4402/elroylamuerte.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img5.imageshack.us/img5/4402/elroylamuerte.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img23.imageshack.us/img23/1588/elrioylamuerte1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img23.imageshack.us/img23/1588/elrioylamuerte1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img25.imageshack.us/img25/7553/elrioylamuerte2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img25.imageshack.us/img25/7553/elrioylamuerte2.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img13.imageshack.us/img13/507/elrioylamuerte3.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img13.imageshack.us/img13/507/elrioylamuerte3.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img7.imageshack.us/img7/6798/elrioylamuerte5.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img7.imageshack.us/img7/6798/elrioylamuerte5.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---not my rip---\n\nFile Details ripped by VERTIGEN ==========\nName........: El rio y la muerte.avi\nFilesize......: 1.09 GB \nRuntime.......: 01:31:00 \nVideo Codec... xvid/ XviD 1.1.0 Beta 2\nVideo Bitrate: 1458 kb/s\nXY................. 720x544 (1.324) (37:28)\nFPS................. 23.976\nAudio Codecs..: 0x200 (DOLBY AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate.. 256 kb/s tot, stereo (2/0)\nFrame Size....: 48000 Hz\nLanguage......: Spanish \n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
