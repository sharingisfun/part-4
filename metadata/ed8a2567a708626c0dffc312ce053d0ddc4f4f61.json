They are learning to think, in other words, and to thrive in the modern economy. \n\nWhat is it like to be a child in the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new education superpowers? \n\nIn a global quest to find answers for our own children, author and Time magazine journalist Amanda Ripley follows three Americans embedÃ‚Â­ded in these countries for one year. Kim, fifteen, raises $10,000 so she can move from Oklahoma to Finland; Eric, eighteen, exchanges a high-achieving Minnesota suburb for a booming city in South Korea; and Tom, seventeen, leaves a historic Pennsylvania village for Poland. \n\nThrough these young informants, Ripley meets battle-scarred reformers, sleep-deprived zombie students, and a teacher who earns $4 million a year. Their stories, along with groundbreaking research into learning in other cultures, reveal a pattern of startling transformation: none of these countries had many Ã¢â‚¬Å“smartÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ kids a few decades ago. Things had changed. Teaching had become more rigorous; parents had focused on things that mattered; and children had bought into the promise of education. \n\nA journalistic tour de force, The Smartest Kids in the World is a book about building resilience in a new worldÃ¢â‚¬â€as told by the young Americans who have the most at stake.
