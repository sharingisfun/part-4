His most famous work, LES FLEURS DU MAL (The Flowers of Evil) -- here presented in multiple translations -- expresses the changing nature of beauty in modern, industrializing Paris during the 19th century.  Baudelaire's highly original style of prose-poetry influenced a whole generation of poets including Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud and StÃƒÂ©phane MallarmÃƒÂ© among many others.  He is credited with coining the term &quot;modernity&quot; (modernitÃƒÂ©) to designate the fleeting, ephemeral experience of life in an urban metropolis, and the responsibility art has to capture that experience.\n\n\nThe following books are a mix of ePUB and PDF formats:\n\n* COMPLETE POEMS (Carcanet, 2006).
