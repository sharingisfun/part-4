On instructions to destroy a relic which the Inquisition considers to be a significant threat, you are drawn into a war between two warring secret societies Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a conspiracy of mages whose goal is true power, and a shadowy cult who seeks to resurrect the Dead God.\n\nAs the story progresses, you will be placed in an amoral world and left to decide your own morality. Just like the real world, your actions have consequences, and it is up to you to decide if you can live with them or not. Play as an altruistic heroine, a vicious and selfish egotist, or just a woman trying to get her job done Ã¢â‚¬â€œ your actions will lead you to one of six different endings depending on where you decide your loyalties lie. Will you crush religion underfoot, or become its savior? Only you can decide!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/99c25f1b4b39ac2dae188875e5b335011cd2b44e.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/99c25f1b4b39ac2dae188875e5b335011cd2b44e.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInstall and Play.\n\nOther:\nGenre:........................................rpg / action / fantasy\nDownload size:...........................889 MB\nRelease date:.............................October 1, 2004\nCompatible with:........................Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8)\nLanguages:................................Engish\nDeveloper / Publisher:................3D People / Games Farm\nGame modes:.............................single-player\nAge requirements: ESRB Rating: MATURE with Blood, Violence.
