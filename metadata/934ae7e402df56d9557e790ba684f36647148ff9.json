Lang's music is notable for both his unusual voice, which at 13 was compared to that of a 40-year-old blues veteran, and for his guitar solos. His solo patterns have especially been noted for his frequent use of wide vibratos.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTurn Around is the fifth studio album by American blues guitarist Jonny Lang, released on September 19, 2006 (see 2006 in music). On February 11, 2007, it won the Grammy Award for Best Rock or Rap Gospel Album.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFrom Amazon.com:\n\n\n&quot;With this album I want to focus, more than ever before, on my purpose in life,&quot; he explains. &quot;I've been so incredibly blessed. My wife and I just had our fifth anniversary. I get to do what I love for a living. But it wasn't so long ago that I was spiraling downward in a lot of ways, until God touched my life and set me on the right track. I feel a huge debt to give glory back to Him for everything He has done for me. It's the least I can do.&quot;\n\nThat said, Turn Around is not slotted only to listeners who have - or have not - undergone this kind of transformation. It inspires, excites, and gets people on their feet - but it doesn't preach. &quot;I understand that not everybody believes as I do,&quot; Lang says, &quot;which is fine. I just want to sing about what's going on in my life and let people make up their own minds about that.&quot;\n\nFor all the conviction that Lang brings to Turn Around, the album began almost as an afterthought. Lang was in the studio one day with his producer, Ron Fair, who is also president of A&amp;M/Interscope Records. There wasn't anything pressing on the agenda; they were doing routine work on the final stages of Lang's previous record, Long Time Coming. Then, out of the blue, Fair said something completely unexpected.\n\n&quot;He looks at me and goes, `Dude, you need to make a gospel record,'&quot; Lang says, laughing at the recollection. &quot;Now, I hadn't really mentioned much to Ron about that side of my life, but for some reason he knew where I was at. So I thought about it for just a second and said, `Yes, I do.'&quot;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBand Members:\n\nJonny Lang - lead vocals, lead guitar, acoustic guitar, acoustic piano\nDrew Ramsey - rhythm guitar, synthesizer\nShannon Sanders - organ\nMichael Bland - drums\nJim Anton - bass guitar\n\n\nAdditional performers:\n\nAaron Pearce - Wurlitzer organ\nJavier Solis - percussion\nDave Davidson - violin\nDavid Angell - violin\nKristin Wilkinson - viola\nAnthony Lamarchina - cello\nMichael McDonald - piano, vocals\nSara Watkins - fiddle\nHaylie Lang - vocals\nQuentin Ware - trumpet\nJim Horn - baritone saxophone\nDoug Moffet - tenor saxophone\nBarry Green - trombone\nChris Dunn - trombone\nBuddy Miller - guitar\nSam Bush - mandolin\nKenny Meeks - upright bass, hurdy-gurdy\n\n\nThe Jonny Lang Thankful Choir:\n\nJonny Lang\nDrew Ramsey\nShannon Sanders\nMatthew Johnson\nDanelle Corbin\nAmetria Dock\nChimere Scott\nJackie Wilson\nRebecca Shocklee\nDean Esther\nKim Keyes\nCynthia Matthews\nAaron Pearce\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:934ae7e402df56d9557e790ba684f36647148ff9","amp;dn":"Jonny+Lang+-+Turn+Around+%5B2006%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"934ae7e402df56d9557e790ba684f36647148ff9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,74,231,228,2,223,86,217,85,126,121,11,166,132,243,102,71,20,143,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
