William Staniger was Yoga Journal's founding editor. Judith Lasater was Copy Editor, Janis Paulsen, Elmer Brunsman, and Jean Girardot were Assistant Editors, and Ike Lasater was Business and Advertising Director. Their goal was to create a magazine that would unite the growing yoga community and provide &quot;material that combines the essence of classical yoga with the latest understandings of modern science.&quot;\r\n\r\nIam just starting my yoga practice, and as I looked for more details of poses and such online after class, I kept ending up on the YogaJournal.com website. Last time grocery shopping I picked up a copy, couldn't put it down, and ordered a subscription. As a beginner I have found it VERY interesting with articles on how yoga is helping patients mentally and physically with breast cancer, common sense articles on herbs for ailments AND yoga poses to ease an ailment also, many others--I read it literally cover to cover. I found it really helpful to go from class (a bunch of ladies bonding over our struggles to balance or stay in a pose) to how the rest of the (yoga) world perceives/practices/enriches through yoga! I found it perfectly readable for a complete beginner to augment class instruction (oooh the possibilities!!!) to wanting to set it aside and review as I get further along in the future. And their website is a wealth of information as well.\r\n\r\n=======================================\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/shtihl22\r\n\r\n=======================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d23ffea11ec5a6dea5007486f7b60984b22a6977","amp;dn":"Yoga+Journal+USA+-+October+2016+True+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d23ffea11ec5a6dea5007486f7b60984b22a6977","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,63,254,161,30,197,166,222,165,0,116,134,247,182,9,132,178,42,105,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
