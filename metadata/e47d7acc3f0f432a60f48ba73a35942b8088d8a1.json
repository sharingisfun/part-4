Yet with these elite warriors who were bound by a code of honor called BushidoÃ¢â‚¬â€the Way of the WarriorÃ¢â‚¬â€the reality behind the myth proves more fascinating than any fiction. In Samurai, celebrated author John Man provides a unique and captivating look at their true history, told through the life of one man: Saigo Takamori, known to many as &quot;the last samurai.&quot; In 1877 Takamori led a rebel army of samurai in a heroic &quot;last stand&quot; against the Imperial Japanese Army, who sought to end the &quot;way of the sword&quot; in favor of firearms and modern warfare. Man's thrilling narrative brings to life the hidden world of the samurai as never before.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e47d7acc3f0f432a60f48ba73a35942b8088d8a1","amp;dn":"Samurai%3A+The+Last+Warrior%3A+A+History+%282014%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e47d7acc3f0f432a60f48ba73a35942b8088d8a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,125,122,204,63,15,67,42,96,244,139,167,58,53,148,43,128,136,216,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
