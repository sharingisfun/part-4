Michael Straczynski and superstar artist Shane Davis is here! Young Clark Kent continues his journey toward becoming the World's Greatest Super Hero but finds dealing with humanity to be a bigger challenge than he ever imagined! From a ruthless dictator to a new love interest who's NOT Lois Lane, things are never easy for this emerging Man of Steel. And the worst is yet to come, in the form of a man-monster with an insatiable appetite, the Parasite! The only thing that might appease his hunger is The Last Son of Krypton! But that will also mean he will have SupermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powers without his conscience, and Kal-El learns to live without powers beyond those of mere mortals.\n\nBY J. MICHAEL STRACZYNSKI AND SHANE DAVIS\n\nPUBLISHED BY DC\n\nENJOY AND SEED...\n\nP.S.
