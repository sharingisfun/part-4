Deciding upon the best course to follow will require comprehending a minefield of risks, while poised at a crossroads, pondering the death of the dollar.\n\nThe U.S. dollar has been the global reserve currency since the end of World War II. If the dollar fails, the entire international monetary system will fail with it. But optimists have always said, in essence, that confidence in the dollar will never truly be shaken, no matter how high our national debt or how dysfunctional our government.\n\nIn the last few years, however, the risks have become too big to ignore. While Washington is gridlocked, our biggest rivalsÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚â€China, Russia, and the oil-producing nations of the Middle EastÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚â€are doing everything possible to end U.S. monetary hegemony. The potential results: Financial warfare. Deflation. Hyperinflation. Market collapse. Chaos.\n\nJames Rickards, the acclaimed author of Currency Wars, shows why money itself is now at risk and what we can all do to protect ourselves. He explains the power of converting unreliable investments into real wealth: gold, land, fine art, and other long-term stores of value","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a045243b1a658dedde8cb3ea644a7c242ca88461","amp;dn":"James+Rickards+-+The+Death+of+Money","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a045243b1a658dedde8cb3ea644a7c242ca88461","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,69,36,59,26,101,141,237,222,140,179,234,100,74,124,36,44,168,132,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
