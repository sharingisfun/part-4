Smith won an Academy Award for her delicately textured portrayal of an eccentric teacher at an exclusive Scottish girl's school. Miss Jean exhorts her &quot;gels&quot; to follow their hearts and never lose their youthful idealism. Unfortunately for her, she also stumps for her favorite political figures: Mussolini and Franco. In addition, she can't keep the innermost details of her private life a secret, and in fact boasts about her sex life to her students. Her prize pupil (Pamela Franklin) becomes so much a clone of Miss Jean that she ends up a threat to the teacher. Ultimately, Miss Jean loses her position, but not the hearts of her students. The box-office success of Prime of Miss Jean Brodie was due in great part to the popularity of the title song, as recorded by Rod McKuen. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064840/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064840/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_of_Miss_Jean_Brodie_(film)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_of_Miss_Jean_Brodie_(film)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nSubtitles:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.5sub.com/movie.aspx?m=d3cf9fc2-8f44-4e22-8fa8-0981ef404ef9&amp;k=The&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.5sub.com/movie.aspx?m=d3cf9fc2-8f44-4e22-8fa8-0981ef404ef9&amp;k=The&lt;/a&gt; Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\n\n\n\nAwards:Won Oscar.
