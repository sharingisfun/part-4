You only need to see him perform live to realize the depth of this man's talent. Forget all the pre-fab, manufactured pop &quot;icons&quot; mass marketed by record companies today - James Taylor is nothing of the sort. When James gained his fame back in the late 60's and 70's, it was based on nothing less than exceptional musical talent.\nJames Taylor writes moving songs, and he can pick a guitar with the best of them. His tenor voice is unmistakable, one of the smoothest crooners in popular music. It takes an extraordinary musician to remain in the limelight over the course of four decades, as James has done - he deserves all the accolades and recognition he's received over the years.\nThis greatest hits album is a wonderful collection of some of James Taylor's best tunes. It's marvelous to be able to hear songs like &quot;Sweet Baby James,&quot; &quot;You've Got a Friend,&quot; or &quot;Carolina In My Mind&quot; played under the technological gift of digitally remastered recording - these tunes have NEVER sounded better!\nI don't blame you for holding onto your old James Taylor recordings - whether they're 8-track, vinyl, or cassette. You've probably got lots of memories tied up in those recordings! But I urge you to take advantage of the digital sound offered in this new release. This quality digital recording finally does justice to twenty timeless tunes from one of the best singer-songwriters ever. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43bdb9225ad9bb96c3ccb1c5b29b38eed6632966","amp;dn":"James+Taylor+-+The+Best+Of+%5BFlac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43bdb9225ad9bb96c3ccb1c5b29b38eed6632966","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,189,185,34,90,217,187,150,195,204,177,197,178,155,56,238,214,99,41,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
