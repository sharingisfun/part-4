This is supposed to be the Enhanced version of Ground Environment X, with new textures, especially for mountainous areas.  \n\nUnfortunately, I'm reformatting my hard drive, so I don't have FSX installed on my computer at the moment, so I couldn't test how the new textures look.  The files, though, do appear to be for the Enhanced version, so there should be no problem.  If someone could report back on how they look compared to the old GEX, that would be appreciated. \n\nEnjoy, and, as always, seed!
