The results of running a Binary Template are much easier to understand and edit than using just the raw hex bytes.\n\n* Binary Templates are easy to write and look similar to C/C++ structs except they\n  may contain if, for, or while statements as well as functions or complex\n  expressions.\n* Powerful enough to parse almost any binary file format.\n* Can be set to run automatically when files are opened.\n* Templates may be shared and a list of templates for download is available in our\n  Template Archive.\n\t\t\n\n*** Analysis Tools - Drill into your Data\n\nA number of sophisticated tools are included with 010 Editor for analyzing and\nediting binary files:\n\n* Full Find, Replace, Find in Files, and Replace in Files functionality for many\n  different data types.\n* Powerful Binary Comparison tool for analyzing byte-by-byte differences between\n  two files.\n* Use the Histogram tool to count byte occurrences and visualize data.\n* Computes Check Sum/Hash Algorithms including CRC-16, CRC-32, Adler32, MD2, MD4, MD5, RIPEMD160, SHA-1, SHA-256, TIGER, etc.\n\t\t\n\n*** Scripting - Automate your Editing\n\n* Simple or complex editing operations can be automated using a syntax similar to\n  C/C++.\n* Features over 275 different functions for operating on data.\n* Integrated with Binary Templates to intuitively edit files. Simply assign to\n  variables defined in a Binary Template to modify a file.\n* Scripts may be shared and a list of scripts for download is available in our\n  Script Archive.\n* Run scripts from the command line with no user interface for batch processing.\n\t\t\n\n*** plus much more.\n\n* Powerful Workspace view including file explorer.\n* Convert data between ASCII, EBCDIC, Unicode, UTF-8, etc.\n* Inspector allows data to be quickly interpreted in different formats.\n* Mark important bytes using Bookmarks.\n* Full integrated expression calculator.\n* Apply Highlighting rules to identify bytes in a file.\n* Import or export data in Intel Hex Format, Motorola S-Records, Hex Text,\n  C/C++/Java Code, Base64, Uuencoding, RTF, or HTML.\n* Printing with full print preview, headers, footers, and margins. \n\n\n1) Install software.\n2) Use one of the keys.\n3) haxx binaries.\n\n\nSUPPORT THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS.
