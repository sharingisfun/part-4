The group in question plays a hockey based game on roller skates and is quite good. It has given them a unity that transcends the attempts to bring them to heel by the government. Finding an orb of special power, they find it has unusual effects on them. They escape from the orphanage (on skates) and try to cross the wasteland looking for a place they can live free as the stormtroopers search for them and the orb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4f5aef3224328d234376f733a9a67b79127f25a","amp;dn":"Solarbabies+%281986%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4f5aef3224328d234376f733a9a67b79127f25a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,245,174,243,34,67,40,210,52,55,111,115,58,154,103,183,145,39,242,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
