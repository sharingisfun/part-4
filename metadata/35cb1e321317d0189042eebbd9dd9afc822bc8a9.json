After all, Mia is his best friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s little sister. Except sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not so little anymore. And Gabe has waited a long time to act on his desires.\n\nGabe has starred in MiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fantasies more than once, ever since she was a teenager with a huge crush on her brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best friend. So what if GabeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 14 years older? Mia knows heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way out of her league, but her attraction has only grown stronger with time. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an adult now, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no reason not to act on her most secret desires. As Gabe pulls her into his provocative world, she realizes thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lot she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know about him or how exacting his demands can be. Their relationship is intense and obsessive, but as they cross the line from secret sexual odyssey to something deeper, their affair runs the risk of being exposed - and is vulnerable to a betrayal far more intimate than either expected.\n\nFever\n\nJace Crestwell, Ash McIntyre, and Gabe Hamilton have been best friends and successful business partners for years. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re powerful, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re imposing, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re irresistibly sexy, and Jace and Ash share everything - including their women. When they meet Bethany, Jace begins to feel things heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never experienced before: jealousy and a powerful obsession that threatens him, overwhelms him - and excites him beyond control. Jace isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sharing Bethany - with anyone. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s determined to be the only man in her life, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jeopardizing a lifelong friendship with Ash. Bethany will be his and his alone. Even if it means turning his back on his best friend.\n\nBurn\n\nAsh, Jace, and Gabe: three of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the country. They're accustomed to getting anything they want. Anything at all. For Ash, it's the woman who changes everything heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever known about dominance and desire....\n\nWhen it comes to sex, Ash McIntyre has always explored his wilder side - extreme and uncompromising. He demands control. And he prefers women who want it like that. Even the ones he's shared with his best friend, Jace.\n\nBut Jace is involved with a woman he has no intention of sharing. And now even Gabe has settled into a relationship with someone who gives him everything he needs, leaving Ash feeling restless and unfulfilled.\n\nThen Ash meets Josie, who seems immune to his charms and his wealth. Intrigued, he begins a relentless pursuit, determined she wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be the one who got away. He never imagined the one woman to tell him no would be the only woman whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d ever drive him to the edge of desire.\n\n\n\nMy thanks to funfactory as the original uploader for books 1 &amp; 2 - http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8336790/Breathless_Series_%28Books_1__amp__2%29_-_Maya_Banks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35cb1e321317d0189042eebbd9dd9afc822bc8a9","amp;dn":"Maya+Banks+-+Breathless+Trilogy+-++Rush%2C+Fever%2C+Burn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35cb1e321317d0189042eebbd9dd9afc822bc8a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,203,30,50,19,23,208,24,144,66,238,187,217,221,154,252,130,43,200,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
