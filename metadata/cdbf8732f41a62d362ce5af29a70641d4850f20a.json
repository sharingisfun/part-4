It is in my opinion, a reflective cross section of some of the man&amp;#039;s best work. It should be of interest to anyone wanting an introduction to Christy Moore, or to the genre of Irish Traditional music.\n\nHis songs are entertaining, poetic, provocative and often controversial - the key ingredients for great music!\n\nI was shocked by the lack of fame this man has achieved outside Ireland, and I hope you will join me in seeding this compilation in the hope of spreading the word of this man&amp;#039;s genius.\n\nPlease comment on this compilation if you liked it, or you can think of any glaring omissions.\n\nTracklist;\n\n1.\tThe Craic Was Ninety In The Isle of Man (Live in Dublin, 1979)\nA nice up tempo song about a crowd of Dublin lads who go out drinking and end up on a boat to the Isle of Man. Shenanigans ensue.\n \n2.\tDelirium Tremens (Live at the Point, 1994)\nA hilarious song Moore has written about his own personal struggle with alcohol abuse.\n\n3.\tJoxer Goes to Stuttgart (Live at the Point, 1994)\nSong about the historic 1988 Irish victory over England in the European Soccer Championships.\n\n4.\tMcIlhatton (Ride On, 1984)\nA song about a poitÃƒÂ­n maker in the Glens of Antrim. Written by hunger striker and MP, Bobby Sands, in the maze prison and smuggled out on cigarette papers.\n\n5.\tThe Reel in the Flickering Light (Ordinary Man, 1985) \nA fanciful song about anthropomorphised insects and animals. Christy has described this song as one that is ?not for the cynics?.\n\n6.\tSmoke &amp; Strong Whiskey (Smoke &amp; Strong Whiskey, 1991)\nA powerful social commentary criticising both church and state.\n\n7.\tViva La Quinta Brigada (Ride On, 1984)\nAbout the Irish socialist volunteers who fought against Franco and the fascists during the Spanish Civil War.\n\n8.\tAisling (Smoke &amp; Strong Whiskey, 1991)\nAn up tempo song about separated lovers, lyrics by Shane MacGowan but the melody by Christy. He has said on his website ?I have never been happy with the result. A flawed tune and a great lyric?. Yer talking nonsense, Moore, you did a great job!\n\n9.\tSacco and Vanzetti (The Time Has Come, 1983)\nTells the tale of two Italian-born American anarchists, who were arrested, tried, and executed via electrocution in Massachusetts for the charge of murder and theft. There is much controversy regarding their guilt.\n\n10.\tSpancil Hill (w/Shane McGowan) (RTÃƒâ€°&amp;#039;s Late Late Show, 1994)\nThis song is about Irish Emigration and was originally written in the Mid 19th Century, around the time of the Great Famine. This is a powerful version, with Shane McGowan, front man of the Pogues, and later the Popes.\n\n11.\tBack Home In Derry (Ride On, 1984) \nA song about a ship of prisoners bound for the British penal colony of Van Dieman&amp;#039;s land (modern day Tasmania). The song was censored and subsequently banned at the time by RTÃƒâ€° and the BBC because of its political overtones and the fact that it was written by prominent republican, Bobby Sands. In his book &quot;One Voice: My life in Song&quot; Christy writes that he first came across the song when &quot;staying in a house in Derry after a H-block concert and a young lad recently released sang this song...despite it being banned it has entered the national repertoire and has been recorded by a thousand ballad bands and will long outlive its detractors and severest critics.&quot;\n\n12.\tA Stitch in Time (This Is The Day, 2001)\nAbout a woman who cleverly seeks her revenge on her abusive, drunken husband.\n\n13.\tBurning Times (Burning Times, 2005)\nAbout the church?s inquisitions, burning alleged ?witches? at the stake.\n\n14.\tLakes Of Pontchartrain (The Time Has Come, 1983)\nA poetic tale of unrequited love between and Irishman, and a New Orleans Creole girl.\n\n15.\tThe City Of Chicago (Ride On, 1984)\nWritten by his brother and equally accomplished artist, Luka Bloom. Deals with those forced to emigrate.\n\n16.\tGo Move Shift (Live at the Point, 1994)\nA protest song about the rights of the travelling people.\n\n17.\tMissing You (Live at the Point, 1994)\nSet in the 1980s, a time when Ireland suffered massive unemployment rates, and young people were forced to emigrate to make a living. But they?ll ?never go home now because of the shame / Of a misfit&amp;#039;s reflection in a shop window pane?.\n\n18.\tOnly Our Rivers Run Free (The Time Has Come, 1983)\nA beautiful rebel song about the continued British influence in Ireland.\n\n19.\tNorth and south of the river (Graffiti Tongue, 1996)\nOriginally written as a collaboration with U2, this is a powerful acoustic version of an anti-violence song about the divide in Ireland. Reminds me a lot of Paul Brady?s ?The Island?.\n\n20.\tRide On (Ride On, 1984)\nBy now legendary love song written by Jimmy MacCarthy.\n\n21.\tNancy Spain (Live at the Point, 1994)\nAnother evocative love song about separated lovers.\n\n22.\tYellow Triangle (Graffiti Tongue, 1996)\nDealing with the Holocaust and the fact that &quot;All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing,&quot; (Edmund Burke). Superimposed yellow triangles, forming the Star of David, was the insignia Jews were forced to wear in the Nazi concentration camps.\n\n23.\tBlack is the Colour (Live at the Point, 1994)\nA version of the Scottish traditional love song.\n\n24.\tLittle Musgrave (Planxty Live, 2004)\nAn old English ballad of an adulterous affair, words adapted by Christy and performed with his old band, Planxty.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdbf8732f41a62d362ce5af29a70641d4850f20a","amp;dn":"Christy+Moore+-+The+Best+Of+%28Great+Irish+Traditional+Musician%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdbf8732f41a62d362ce5af29a70641d4850f20a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,191,135,50,244,26,98,211,98,206,90,242,154,112,100,29,72,80,242,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
