Do you aspire to be a loving parent but all too often Ã¢â‚¬Å“lose itÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in hurtful ways? Do you crave intimacy but sometimes wonder if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth the struggle? Or are you plagued by constant vague feelings of anxiety or depression?\n\nIf any of this sounds familiar, you may be experiencing the hidden but damaging effects of a painful childhoodÃ¢â‚¬â€carrying within you a Ã¢â‚¬Å“wounded inner childÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that is crying out for attention and healing.\n\nIn this powerful book, John Bradshaw shows how we can learn to nurture that inner child, in essence offering ourselves the good parenting we needed and longed for. Through a step-by-step process of exploring the unfinished business of each developmental stage, we can break away from destructive family rules and roles and free ourselves to live responsibly in the present. Then, says Bradshaw, the healed inner child becomes a source of vitality, enabling us to find new joy and energy in living.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e6ab45c72aedfd370077ccbe4c423c554a62779","amp;dn":"Homecoming%3A+Reclaiming+and+Healing+Your+Inner+Child","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e6ab45c72aedfd370077ccbe4c423c554a62779","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,106,180,92,114,174,223,211,112,7,124,203,228,196,35,197,84,166,39,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
