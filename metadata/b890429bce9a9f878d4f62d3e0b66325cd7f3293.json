However, her brother has his doubts, and calls in private investigator Cormoran Strike to look into the case.\n\nStrike is a war veteran - wounded both physically and psychologically - and his life is in disarray. The case gives him a financial lifeline, but it comes at a personal cost: the more he delves into the young model's complex world, the darker things get - and the closer he gets to terrible danger . . .\n\nA gripping, elegant mystery steeped in the atmosphere of London - from the hushed streets of Mayfair to the backstreet pubs of the East End to the bustle of Soho - The Cuckoo's Calling is a remarkable book. Introducing Cormoran Strike, this is a classic crime novel in the tradition of P. D. James and Ruth Rendell, and marks the beginning of a unique series of mysteries.\n\n\nBook format: PDF\n\nBook Cover:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8Afogo9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8Afogo9.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b890429bce9a9f878d4f62d3e0b66325cd7f3293","amp;dn":"The+Cuckoos+Calling+-+Robert+Galbraith%28aka+J.K+Rowling%29%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b890429bce9a9f878d4f62d3e0b66325cd7f3293","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,144,66,155,206,154,159,135,141,79,98,211,224,182,99,37,205,127,50,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
