I have the christmas episodes in here, and have renamed the files so they contain the name of the episodes.\n\nThere is a Doctor Who folder, and in that folder, each season has it's own folder.  The naming scheme for the episodes is E101, E102, E103, etc...  I have a few of the prequels included, which have episode numbers of E100, E200, E300, etc..  The seasons officially start with the 01's, but I put the specials in where they are intended to fall.  I didn't include any of the animated programs or the shorts between episodes.  It wasn't worth the effort to find them all and include them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2133de6ec81886e4588fea7afc3ab74a85f4132","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+S01--S07--Complete+with+holiday+episodes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2133de6ec81886e4588fea7afc3ab74a85f4132","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,19,61,230,236,129,136,110,69,136,254,167,175,195,171,116,168,95,65,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
