McInerny\n2004 | 160 Pages | ISBN: 1400061717 | PDF | 2 MB\n\n\n\n&quot;In logic, as in life, it is the obvious that most often bears emphasizing, because it so easily escapes our notice,&quot; McInerny argues in this pithy guide to applying logical thinking to everyday life. Modeled after Strunk and WhiteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s indispensable handbook, The Elements of Style, McInernyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s primer offers valuable counsel on making a clear and effective point. He calls attention to the tremendous importance that language holds in the crafting and presentation of an argument, advising readers to &quot;make your words as precise and sharply focused as possible&quot; and to keep arguments, or at least their essential purpose, simple. Readers need not have a background in philosophy to follow McInernyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s remarkably comprehensible explanation of the methods used to construct a valid case, including the syllogistic argument, the conjunctive and disjunctive arguments and the conditional argument.
