Jim loved to swim and was an excellent swimmer. However, as the only black swimmer on his college team, Jim encountered discrimination from other teams at swim meets. After being turned down for a teaching job at a private school in Philadelphia, Jim needs money, and he takes a temporary job packing up items at a rundown recreation center that is about to be demolished. Jim finds the pool and brings the pool back to life. Elston (Bernie Mac) the custodian for many years thinks Jim is crazy. Jim thinks he can help some of the kids in the neighborhood by forming the city's first African-American swim team and compete in the state championship meet. Maybe he can even save the P.D.R. (Philadelphia Department of Recreation) center from being torn down.\n   \n\nTAGLINE:\n\n\nThere are no shortcuts to a dream.    Reach for it with everything you've got.
