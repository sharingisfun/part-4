ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to follow, it wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t leave you hungry, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s built for long-lasting results. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s healthiest diet. And people on the DASH Diet feel better and think more clearly. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s because, also unlike most diets, the DASH Diet was originally developed by a team of medical researchers who were funded by the NIH and led by Dr. Thomas Moore. The teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s goal was to create a diet to lower blood pressure (DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension), and they came up with an easy eating plan that has since been proven to lower high blood pressure and reduce the development of hypertension, lower cholesterol, and reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes, heart failure, and kidney stones, as well as reduce the risk of developing colon cancer. And the researchers noticed something else along with these incredible medical benefits: while eating a varied, hearty diet of nutritious foods, people on the DASH Diet also were able to lose weight and maintain that healthy weight loss over time. Named the Best Overall Diet by U.S. News &amp; World Report two years in a row and recommended by the US Department of Agriculture as an ideal eating pattern for all Americans, the DASH Diet is easy to follow and allows you to choose the foods you like. Now, based on new data from Dr. MooreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s continuing research, The DASH Diet for Weight Loss adapts the DASH Diet for anyone who wants to reach his or her healthiest weight. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to calculate calorie targets and learn what counts as a serving; how to add exercise to the diet; how to keep a food log, plan a menu, and adapt favorite recipes for the DASH Diet. And youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to keep off the weight you lost.\n\nWith versions for meat-eaters and vegetarians, the DASH Diet is a plan you can stick to because it offers a wide selection of your favorite foods, not special supplements or meals that you have to buy from a specific manufacturer. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll read inspiring before-and-after stories by others who have experienced success with DASH. And youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find extensive meal plans at the calorie level that is just right for you, concentrating on how to lose weight without sacrificing great-tasting foods. You can reach your goal to lose weight and keep it off by following AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s healthiest diet. The DASH Diet for Weight Loss will show you how.\n\n\nThe DASH Diet for Weight Loss Ã¢â‚¬â€œ April 17, 2012\nBook Language: English \nFile Type: Pdf, Epub, Mobi\nFile Size: 7.92 MB\n\n\nISBN-10: 1451669364\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/q5xDSBG.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/q5xDSBG.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c2fab60745428ab2260defc3de3017d4c05e677","amp;dn":"The+Dash+Diet+For+Weight+Loss","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c2fab60745428ab2260defc3de3017d4c05e677","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,47,171,96,116,84,40,171,34,96,222,252,61,227,1,125,76,5,230,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
