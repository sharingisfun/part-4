Most, if not all of the cast are probably still in their teens and still in school. Even though it is low budget, it looks very professional. More professional than a lot of other low budget British films. The writing is very funny, a lot of monty python, Airplane, and Naked Gun kind of humour. It feels a bit slow at times, but is still a very enjoyable film. It's a bit more over the top and surreal than Blazing Saddles. One of the funniest western parody I've ever seen. [imdb]\nthis is the second film of Edgar Wright (shaun of the dead, hot fuzz) (thx evilmofo 4 mention :))","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22642d9b07e2dfb2cedf3867237b8b14b429636d","amp;dn":"A+Fistful+Of+Fingers.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22642d9b07e2dfb2cedf3867237b8b14b429636d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,100,45,155,7,226,223,178,206,223,56,103,35,123,139,20,180,41,99,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
