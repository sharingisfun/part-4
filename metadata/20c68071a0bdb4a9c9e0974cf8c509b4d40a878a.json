It will be useful to graduate students and advanced undergraduates in all engineering fields as well as students of physics, chemistry, geophysics and other physical sciences and professional engineers who wish to learn about how advanced mathematics can be used in their professions. The reader will learn about applications to heat transfer, fluid flow, and mechanical vibrations. The book is written in such a way that solution methods and application to physical problems are emphasized. There are many examples presented in detail and fully explained in their relation to the real world. References to suggested further reading are included. The topics that are covered include classical separation of variables and orthogonal functions, Laplace transforms, complex variables, and Sturm-Liouville transforms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20c68071a0bdb4a9c9e0974cf8c509b4d40a878a","amp;dn":"Essentials+of+Applied+Mathematics+for+Scientists+and+Engineers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20c68071a0bdb4a9c9e0974cf8c509b4d40a878a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,198,128,113,160,189,180,169,201,224,151,76,248,197,9,180,212,10,135,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
