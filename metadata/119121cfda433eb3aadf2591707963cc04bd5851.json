These healing tones are often found in the form of ancient mystic chanting. The same vibrational patterns are also encoded within many Gregorian chants. Their power comes from the specific frequency and its direct effect on human consciousness in general.\n\nWe are all conscious beings that vibrate at specific rates. These rates or frequencies can be harnessed to maximize your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual growth.\n\nYou can use these sacred healing frequencies to maximize your conscious evolution, create an open channel for physical and spiritual development, enhance your self-healing abilities and provide deep mental and physical rejuvenation as well as a huge list of other benefits that you can experience, simply by listening to this BMV CD.\n\nIt is an amazingly powerful collection of brainwave sessions.\n\nWhen you experience the BMV Series 24: The Sacred Healing Frequencies CD, your mind will naturally float inwards and your consciousness will expand as you listen to tones embedded within the mesmerizing audio soundscapes. Your awareness will become free to explore new states of clarity and new modes of perception as you experience the effects of the embedded brainwave entrainment technology. Your conscious awareness will become free to take flight into your mind&amp;#039;s eye.\n\nYou will explore new depths as the embedded brainwave entrainment ensures that you will enter the ideal brainwave range for maximizing the human evolution ofyour consciousness.\n\nThis BMV CD is an excellent audio tool for biofeedback training and consciousness development.\n\nThe BMV Series 24: The Sacred Healing Frequencies CD contains no guided vocals (*no spoken words) so it can be used for any meditational purposes or simply as a tool for experiencing profound states of relaxation. You can repeat your favorite track or loop the entire psychoacoustic CD for amazing results!\n\nEvery time you use this CD, you will become more and more relaxed. With time and practice, you can learn to access these profound states of awareness at will. In the meanwhile, you can be assured that your brainwaves will be tuned to the correct frequency ranges to maximize your results.\n\nAs the hypnotic wrap-around sounds create a 3-D atmosphere in your mind&amp;#039;s eye, you will become more and more relaxed. This psychoacoustic voyage also contains our new Autonomic Audio-Pacing TechnologyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ (AAPT). You will hear the sounds of heartbeats and controlled breathing patterns floating in the distance.\n\nThe heart rate and breathing cycle on the CD continually slows down at specific rates. Experienced meditators whose bodily functions were monitored using Biofeedback Equipment (EEG/EKG/GSR) show the exact same lowered rates of heartbeat and breathing. The same decreased rates that you will experience when you listen to this CD!\n\nAs the pacing slows down even more, you will see yourself slowing down too. Deeper and deeper, you go. Your heart rate and your breathing cycle naturally slows down even more to mirror the rhythm of this powerful progressive relaxation.\n\nBy simply listening to this CD for 10 minutes or less, your physical body will be so relaxed that you will ready for any type of inner work: meditation, creativity, reverie, problem solving, brainstorming, trancework and more.\n\nOver time, you can learn to achieve this state of ultra-deep physical relaxation, naturally and instantaneously.\n\nThe brainwave entrainment technology on this CD ensures your success. Like the magical beat of a shaman&amp;#039;s drum, the embedded brainwave entrainment frequencies slow down your brainwaves to induce deeply expanded states of consciousness.\n\nThe brainwave stimulation techniques are based upon EEG readings of brainwave activity experienced by experienced meditators, Buddhist monks, healers and other adepts.\n\nYou now have the physical relaxation AND the required brainwave activity to complete the process.
