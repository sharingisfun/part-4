In no other Western country has this very attractive medium been used so consistently, or for works of such stature, as in England between 1750 and the present day. In this general survey of the whole period, Graham Reynolds, formerly Keeper of Paintings and of Prints and Drawings at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, discusses the paintings of over 100 artists including the well-known watercolorists such as Cozens, Girtin, Cotman and De Wint, as well as artists who are equally known for their work in other media - Gainsborough, Turner, Constable, Sargent, Henry Moore. The 140 illustrations, 64 in color, show the work of these and lesser-known artists and reveal the versatility of this medium, so the reader will be introduced to its use for illustrative caricature and portraiture as well as to the finest examples of traditional landscape watercolors","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8c2bfdd0f4919906fec98dcdf61cb46e9ad61c9","amp;dn":"English+Watercolors+-+An+Introduction+by+Graham+Reynolds+%28Art+Eb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8c2bfdd0f4919906fec98dcdf61cb46e9ad61c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,194,191,221,15,73,25,144,111,236,152,220,223,97,203,70,233,173,97,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
