It gives detailed explanations of game art techniques and their importance, while also highlighting their dependence on artistic aspects of game design and programming.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n \nÃ¢â‚¬â€ John Romero, co-founder of id Software and CEO of Loot Drop, Inc.\n\n&quot;SolarskiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s methodology here is to show us the artistic techniques that every artist should know, and then he transposes them to the realm of video games to show how they should be used to create a far more artful gaming experience ... if I were an artist planning to do video game work, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d have a copy of this on my shelf.&quot;\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ Marc Mason, Comics Waiting Room\n\nVideo games are not a revolution in art history, but an evolution. Whether the medium is paper or canvasÃ¢â‚¬â€or a computer screenÃ¢â‚¬â€the artistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s challenge is to make something without depth seem like a window into a living, breathing world. Video game art is no different. \n \nDrawing Basics and Video Game Art is first to examine the connections between classical art and video games, enabling developers to create more expressive and varied emotional experiences in games. Artist game designer Chris Solarski gives readers a comprehensive introduction to basic and advanced drawing and design skillsÃ¢â‚¬â€light, value, color, anatomy, concept developmentÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as detailed instruction for using these methods to design complex characters, worlds, and gameplay experiences. Artwork by the likes of Michelangelo, Titian, and Rubens are studied alongside AAA games like BioShock, Journey, the Mario series, and Portal 2, to demonstrate perpetual theories of depth, composition, movement, artistic anatomy, and expression.\n\nFollow me on twitter: @livhre\nRequest books on twitter: @livhre\nPlease seed and rate the torrents I upload.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c371bb1973754748b064755fee1973e6b2ab7ae","amp;dn":"Drawing+Basics+and+Video+Game+Art","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c371bb1973754748b064755fee1973e6b2ab7ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,55,27,177,151,55,84,116,139,6,71,85,254,225,151,62,107,42,183,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
