It was shown at the London Film Festival in 1983 and on Channel 4 a few weeks later, on 1 December. According to the critic Michael Coveney : The sapping, debilitating and demeaning state of unemployment, the futile sense of waste, has not been more poignantly, or poetically, expressed in any other film of the period.\n\n  Marion Bailey  ...

Only the mother Mavis (Pam Ferris) is working; father Frank (Jeff Robert) and the couple's two sons Colin (Tim Roth), a timid, chronically shy individual, and Mark (Phil Daniels), an outspoken, headstrong young man, are on the dole. This situation is contrasted by the presence of Mavis's sister Barbara (Marion Bailey), and her husband John (Alfred Molina), whose financial and social loftiness, in suburban Chigwell, appears to be a comfortable facade over the unspoken soreness of a lacklustre marriage. Gary Oldman makes his film debut as the quirky skinhead Coxy.\n\nOne day at the rehearsal space, a factory in Homerton, Roth and Oldman were throwing a milk bottle around. Suddenly Roth threw it up and it hit a fluorescent lighting strip. Leigh saw,  Gary's shaven head erupt into a thousand red blotches; in the film you can see the stitch marks. He rushed Oldman to hospital. As I drove him there, all done up in his skinhead stuff, covered in blood, Gary said to me, For fuck's sake, tell 'em I'm an actor! He could easily have lost his eyesight in the accident, and I do not know to this day what I would have done if that had happened.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fb8e813633827fd03dfe50c9d81e284782b1f8c","amp;dn":"Meantime+%28TV%29+%5B1984%5D+Mike+Leigh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fb8e813633827fd03dfe50c9d81e284782b1f8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,184,232,19,99,56,39,253,3,223,229,12,157,129,226,132,120,43,31,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
