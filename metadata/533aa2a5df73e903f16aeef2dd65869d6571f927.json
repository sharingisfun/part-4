An amusing piece of eye candy spiked by a few creepy moments, the movie, in typical &amp;#039;80s style, relies heavily on the soundtrack to bolster its emotional core. The soundtrack, like the film, works great on the surface -- but don&amp;#039;t go much deeper. A mix of covers and bombastic &amp;#039;80s pop originals, the songs work best when they concentrate on the horror factor. Echo &amp; the Bunnymen turn in an excellent cover of the Doors&amp;#039; &quot;People Are Strange&quot; that has a bouncier, more melodic touch than the original. Jimmy Barnes and INXS&amp;#039; &quot;Good Times&quot; is an energetic rocker used to personify the party-hardy SoCal atmosphere of the film. The strongest song is the movie&amp;#039;s theme, &quot;Cry Little Sister,&quot; a goth-influenced midtempo ballad. Singer Gerald McMann&amp;#039;s pained phrasing and creepy lyrics, and a chilling chorus sung by what sounds like disembodied children, exemplify the best parts of the movie and the soundtrack.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01 - Good Times - INXS, Jimmy Barnes  [3:49]\n02 - Lost in the Shadows (The Lost Boys) - Lou Gramm  [6:17]\n03 - Don&amp;#039;t Let the Sun Go Down on Me - Roger Daltrey  [6:09]\n04 - Laying Down the Law - INXS, Jimmy Barnes  [4:24]\n05 - People Are Strange - Echo &amp; the Bunnymen  [3:36]\n06 - Cry Little Sister (Theme from the Lost Boys) - Gerard McCann  [4:03]\n07 - Power Play - Eddie &amp; The Tide  [3:57]\n08 - I Still Believe - Tim Capello  [3:42]\n09 - Beauty Has Her Way - Mummy Calls  [3:56]\n10 - To the Shock of Miss Louise - Thomas Newman  [1:21]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:533aa2a5df73e903f16aeef2dd65869d6571f927","amp;dn":"The+Lost+Boys+-+Soundtrack+%281987%29+128kbps+%5BRussTheStalker%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"533aa2a5df73e903f16aeef2dd65869d6571f927","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,58,162,165,223,115,233,3,241,106,238,242,221,101,134,157,101,113,249,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
