Three very different people but all with the same burning ambition - to make it big in Bollywood. It is their consuming passion - one that will brook no obstacle. Each tries in his own way and reaches close to their goal and then face the inevitable heartbreak..\r\n\r\nYet they are not the ones to give up. They gather up their broken dreams for yet another attempt..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUploader's Notes:\r\nThe film may be good, but the DVD certainly does not do it justice. It is badly authored with the scenes almost completely and ligh scenes dull! We have tried to correct the poor authoring, without unduly playing with the scenes. Overall the final rip is a considerable improvement over the original DVD.\r\n\r\nThis is a DDR TinyRip encode. It uses x.265 10-bit encoding for higher compressibility and Compressed 128 Kbps Dolby II audio to compress the original 2 hour DVD into a 453 MB rip. The Quality, as you can see from the screen shots is certainly better than the DVD. DDR TinyRips are meant for those downloaders who want conserve bandwidth and yet enjoy high quality rips.\r\n\r\nBe aware that this rip (and all HEVC rips) will not play on many standalone players. You need a compatible standalone video player. You can of course stream it to the large screen TV using a streaming device. On your PC please be sure to use the latest version of video players (VLC (2.1.5 or higher) or Media Player Classic (Ver 1.7.9) or SMPlayer (14.9.0) will work. Earlier versions may not).\r\n\r\n\r\nIMDB Link: \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt4675030/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:182115e88d26acefed1ce67450884a3896f2679c","amp;dn":"BOLLYWOOD+DIARIES+%282016%29+-+HEVC+-+TinyRip+-+x265.AAC.Esubs+-+DDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"182115e88d26acefed1ce67450884a3896f2679c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,33,21,232,141,38,172,239,237,28,230,116,80,136,74,56,150,242,103,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
