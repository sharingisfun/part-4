Zach's one-night stand with a student backfires when that student walks into an interview the next morning calling himself Danny Reyes, the name Zach went by when he attended the school. And Danny's film, &quot;Judas Kiss,&quot; is a finalist in the competition Zach is judging. Zach's film, also &quot;Judas Kiss,&quot; won the festival years before. As Zach scrambles for answers, a mysterious, chain-smoking campus tour guide, counsels him: &quot;Change the kid's past, change your future.&quot; But how? Zach comes to believe he can mend his life by disqualifying Danny from competition, putting him on a different path than Zach followed. But will Zach's plan work?\n\n\nProudly Presents\n\nJudas Kiss (I) (2011\n\nr e l e a s e i n f o\n\nRipper ...........: Team ESPiSE Video Codec ......: XviD\nRelease Date .....: 11/16/2011 Video Quality ....: 879 kbps\nTheater Date .....: 04/01/2011 Resolution .......: 608x336\nDVD RLS Date .....: 10/25/2011 Audio Codec ......: 136 kbps\nDVD Runtime ......: 1:34:53 Audio Bitrate ....: VBR MP3\nAspect Ratio .....: 1.81:1 Framerate ........: 23.976\nLanguage .........: English Subtitles ........: N/A\nIMDb URL..........: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1242642\nIMDB Rating ......: 6.0/10 (138 votes)\nFilm Genre .......: Drama/Sci-Fi\nPacket............: 4915MB\nFilesize..........: 698 MB\n\n\n\n[img]http://img830.imageshack.us/img830/385/vlcsnap2011111616h46m58.png[/img]\n[img]http://img507.imageshack.us/img507/9043/vlcsnap2011111616h46m48.png[/img]\n[img]http://img208.imageshack.us/img208/6681/vlcsnap2011111616h47m05.png[/img]\n[img]http://img695.imageshack.us/img695/1060/vlcsnap2011111616h47m14.png[/img][/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:277004ee5f7f7a5746b97f94b061113997ac9bcc","amp;dn":"Judas.Kiss.2011.DVDRip.XviD-ESPiSE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"277004ee5f7f7a5746b97f94b061113997ac9bcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,112,4,238,95,127,122,87,70,185,127,148,176,97,17,57,151,172,155,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
