Comments appreciated! Please be patient. Tell me here if any bugs!!\n\n\nThis version of Windows 7 is integrated with the TOSHIBA oobe, agreements, logos, oeminfo, certificates, TOSHIBA keys, and all the other stuff and it is pre-activated!! I have also provided a .iso with all the default TOSHIBA Applications that are pre-installed!! And there is a language pack too.\n\n\n\n\n***Note: If you want this version to be pre-activated by OEM, you will need to have SLIC2.1 in your BIOS. Otherwise it might not activate. If you don't get the TOSHIBA logo in your system properties, go to X:_sources_$OEM$_$$_SETUP_SCRIPTS_logos_Toshiba and run reg.\n(replace the _ with /)(replace the dash with slash)\n\n\n\nDashBlacK\n\n\nThere are more seeders than displayed here. Probably tracker error.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76107233e5deb62b5f9f87265b3bb6111a118967","amp;dn":"Windows+7+TOSHIBA+OEM+Pre-Activated","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76107233e5deb62b5f9f87265b3bb6111a118967","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,16,114,51,229,222,182,43,95,159,135,38,91,59,182,17,26,17,137,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
