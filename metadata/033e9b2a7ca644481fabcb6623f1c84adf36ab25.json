It's believed that, once inside a body, all memories of the host \nhuman are gone. Some few free humans remain hidden from them, forming \na resistance group. When an alien Seeker captures a girl named Melanie \nand puts a Wanderer in her body, she hopes to find out where the \nremaining humans are gathered, but Melanie, a strong fighter able to \nconverse with the alien in her commandeered body, convinces the Wanderer \nto say nothing. Disappointed by the lack of progress (though suspecting \nan empathy for the human), the Seeker informs the Wanderer that she'll \nbe removed and placed in a new host while she herself will enter Melanie. \nWith human lives at risk, Melanie convinces Wanderer to run away and hide \nout with the humans, but finding them doesn't mean they'll allow an alien \npresence among them. Jared (Melanie's boyfriend) wants her dead, but Jeb \n(Melanie's uncle) wants to wait, and Ian, tasked with guarding her, finds \nhimself siding with Jeb. As Ian begins to fall for Melanie, a strange \nlove triangle develops, with Ian wanting Wanderer (inhabiting Melanie's \nbody), Jared wanting Melanie (imprisoned inside her own body), and no one \nknowing any way to separate the two without killing both.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Saoirse Ronan.\n=&gt;-Max Irons.\n=&gt;-Jake Abel.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Andrew Niccol.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Adventure : Sci-Fi : Action.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2013.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.64 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 868 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 2h 5mn.\n=&gt;-The Host...................: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_host_2013/\n=&gt;-The Host...................: http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-host-2013/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.35:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 544.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1750 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 173 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:033e9b2a7ca644481fabcb6623f1c84adf36ab25","amp;dn":"The+Host+-+Adventure+Sci-Fi+2013+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"033e9b2a7ca644481fabcb6623f1c84adf36ab25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,62,155,42,124,166,68,72,31,171,203,102,35,241,200,74,223,54,171,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
