Lovell is a magician by trade, and much of the book is given over to detailed sleight-of-hand HOWTOs for palming, greasing, fixing and cheating cards, dice, coins, and so on. Truth be told, this section bogged down a little for me -- unlike, say, The Big Con, which tries to give a representative sample of the world's con-games, Lovell is bent on detailing all of them. But this is more than made up for by the charming, breezy anaecdotes about rip-off bar-bets, boiler-room operations, and so on. I picked this up as reference for stories -- con-jobs are great fiction fodder -- but found myself absorbing its message in pro-active self-defense. Reading this thing cover-to-cover can leave you feeling pretty damned paranoid","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a68e04657dbb1d39e260d168f0cbded69ac9a87","amp;dn":"How+to+Cheat+at+Everything%3A+A+Con+Man+Reveals+the+Secrets+of+the","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a68e04657dbb1d39e260d168f0cbded69ac9a87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,104,224,70,87,219,177,211,158,38,13,22,143,12,189,237,105,172,154,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
