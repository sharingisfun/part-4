The album is as intricate and well-crafted as a Radiohead release, with highly emotional content that was inspired by the recent suicide of frontman Ari PickerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother. Picker said he wanted to give her Ã¢â‚¬Å“a space, in the music, to be, and to become all the things she didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get a chance to be when she was alive.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nThe outcome is an expansive collection of thematically and musically complex songs that serves as a beautiful dedication to the musicianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother, whose photo graces the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cover. The record is filled with tracks that illicit comparisons to Radiohead, Bon Iver, and Sigur RÃƒÂ³s, and the classically trained Picker could pass for an American JÃƒÂ³nsi. A Church That Fits Our Needs is strong from start to finish, though it picks up speed on the dreamy fourth track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Golden EyelidsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which is filled with sophisticated string arrangements and harmonies.\n\nThe next song, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Icy RiverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, begins with subtle sound effects, like trickling water and an eerie crow, that make you feel like youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re actually lost in the trees (touchÃƒÂ©, Picker and Co.). Similar cinematic moments pop up throughout the album, such as the 37-second interlude Ã¢â‚¬Å“Moment TwoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which features similar sounds. From there, Ã¢â‚¬Å“This Dead Bird Is BeautifulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (whose title is reminiscent of Ricky Fitts in American Beauty) pays homage to PickerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother more obviously than other tracks with lyrics like, Ã¢â‚¬Å“DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you say she was weak/IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll carry her/Because she breathed, I breathe.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The vocals on the song, along with those on Ã¢â‚¬Å“GardenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, shine, not because PickerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s talent is lost on other tracks, but because most of the time, the songs are so beautiful as a whole that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to forget what a talented singer he is.\n\nThe last song, Ã¢â‚¬Å“VinesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, is the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shortest (aside from music-less Ã¢â‚¬Å“Moment OneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Moment TwoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), and also one of the most simple. But it serves as the perfect closing as Picker sings, Ã¢â‚¬Å“She came down and put her song into my mouth,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ again referring to his late mother who he says Ã¢â‚¬Å“was an artist in her own right.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He goes on to sing, Ã¢â‚¬Å“There are things that songs canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t say,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but Picker and the rest of Lost in the Trees have said plenty while also crafting a unique album that blends classical music with contemporary flair.\n\nEssential Tracks: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Golden EyelidsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“This Dead Bird Is BeautifulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“VinesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a909eafebf8ab4ce3c497744e935a491ba8c75a5","amp;dn":"Lost+in+the+Trees+-+A+Church+That+Fits+Our+Needs+%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a909eafebf8ab4ce3c497744e935a491ba8c75a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,9,234,254,191,138,180,206,60,73,119,68,233,53,164,145,186,140,117,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
