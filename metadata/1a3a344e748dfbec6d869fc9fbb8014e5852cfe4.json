The world outside has grown unkind, the view of it limited, talk of it forbidden. But there are always those who hope, who dream. These are the dangerous people, the residents who infect others with their optimism. Their punishment is simple. They are given the very thing they profess to want: They are allowed outside.\n\nIt all begins here! Hugh Howey's bestselling Wool makes the leap into comics, with mysteries and thrills for new fans and surprises for the already faithful.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a3a344e748dfbec6d869fc9fbb8014e5852cfe4","amp;dn":"Wool+%28001+-+005%29+%282014%29+%28Digital%29+%28Mephisto%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a3a344e748dfbec6d869fc9fbb8014e5852cfe4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,58,52,78,116,141,251,236,109,134,159,201,251,184,1,78,88,82,207,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
