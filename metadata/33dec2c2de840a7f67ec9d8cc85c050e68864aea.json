He wrote of the battles and campaigns he fought in, names that would go down in history: Gallipoli, the Somme, Ypres, and Arras. Serving in the 1st/5th Battalion (Queens Edinburgh Rifles) Royal Scots and later the 88th Brigade Machine Gun Corps, he left a record of one manâ€™s extraordinary and tragic war. In Somewhere in Blood Soaked France, Alasdair Sutherland reveals this previously unpublished account of the First World War, complete with historical context, orders of battle and extracts from official war diaries. This rare sourceâ€”it was an offense to keep a record in case of captureâ€”offers a stirring insight into the bravery of Mackay and his companions, who were not afraid to die for their country. &quot;If I go under it will be in a good cause, so roll on the adventure.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33dec2c2de840a7f67ec9d8cc85c050e68864aea","amp;dn":"Somewhere+in+Blood+Soaked+France%3A+The+Diary+of+Angus+Mackay","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33dec2c2de840a7f67ec9d8cc85c050e68864aea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,222,194,194,222,132,10,127,103,236,157,140,200,92,5,14,104,134,74,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
