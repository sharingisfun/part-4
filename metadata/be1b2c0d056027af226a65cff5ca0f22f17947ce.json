When Miles tells RJ to picture his life with Lily and then life with Jenny, he decides to tell Lily the truth about Jenny and him. Coach Sinclair holds a fundraiser to help fix the school bus that hit Lily. RJ is mad about this and holds a fundraiser of his own to help pay Lily's medical bills. Max, who wants to settle the score with Miles for beating Max's testicles repeatedly at the dance, cannot beat Miles publicly so Coach Sinclair signs both of them up for a sumo match. During the match, Miles gets the upper hand momentarily until Coach Sinclair trips Miles and Max finishes him off to win. RJ tells Lily that he took Jenny to the dance and that they kissed, and that he must take his shot with her. Lily, who is distraught by this, hits RJ with one of her crutches and declares that RJ is &quot;dead to her&quot; and storms out of the gym while wrecking the fundraiser booths. As they leave Miles tells RJ not to worry too much about Lily, and they both decide that RJ should focus on being with Jenny. In the end, Suzanne and Rick tell RJ that they are getting a divorce.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n  |              |                  |                 |\n2 | Cousin Vinny | David Katzenberg | March 28, 2011  |\n\nCousin Vinny, RJ's cousin, comes to visit to help RJ and his mom move to a new apartment. Vinny later teaches RJ and Miles to look cool for girls. This helps RJ, who had asked Jenny to go out on a date earlier that week. Max hates the idea of Jenny going on a date with RJ and plans on making it as miserable as possible for Jenny and RJ. While at the restaurant, Vinny and Miles stay in the lobby while Jenny and RJ eat dinner. Max stops by and tells RJ and Jenny that this is his place and that they should leave. The last straw for RJ comes when Max throws a piece of bread into Jenny's soup and RJ stands up to Max and attempts to smooth things over with him. When Max tries to hit RJ, the restaurant manager (whom Miles, RJ and Vinny met earlier) knocks Max out and into a salad bar and tells Max and his buddies to lay off of RJ. Vinny and Miles come over and ask if Jenny and RJ want to leave. At the end of the episode RJ and Jenny kiss.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n  |             |              |               |\n3 | The Lock-In | Ryan Shiraki | April 4, 2011 |\n\nRJ and Jenny go to a lock-in at the school, where it is widely known amongst the students to be a &quot;School Sponsored Orgy&quot;. Once there, Miles finds out that Lily plans to sabotage RJ and Jenny from sleeping with each other and Miles locks Lily in the bathroom to stop her. Afterwards, Miles distributes chocolate biscotti that he stole from his brother Chet to everyone but RJ, who is allergic to chocolate. Jenny and RJ sneak off to the Science Lab to be alone. Everyone in the gym who ate the biscotti starts to hallucinate since the biscotti is apparently laced with drugs from Afghanistan. Jenny, who is also affected, pulls off her panties and tries to give RJ oral pleasure but passes out instead. Everyone in the gym, including Coach Sinclair, starts to freak out from the drugs and attempts to flee the school but can't due to the doors being locked. RJ appears and opens the doors, letting everyone leave the school while he carries Jenny out and to the football field. As morning comes, Jenny wakes up on RJ's lap and he tells her what happened during the previous night. They leave the field with the sprinklers coming on and everyone else starts to recover from the drug-laced biscotti.\n\nGuest Star: Paris Hilton \n___________________________________________________________________________________\n  |            |              |                |\n4 | Ugly Jenny | Ryan Shiraki | April 11, 2011 |\n\nJenny comes to school in a depression when she reveals that she has a zit, for the first time. Jenny is very upset about this after Miles tells her it wont go away in time for her cheerleader picture. Meanwhile, Lily gains a large sum of cash after her settlement money comes in from her accident, allowing her to buy her popularity from the jocks. This puts her at odds with RJ, while Miles ends up becoming her personal assistant. RJ tries his best to comfort Jenny with her zits, but ends up hurting her feelings. Lily comes to the realization that Robin is only using her to buy her expensive items like jewelry and make-up and finds Jenny in the bathroom sobbing to the fact that she has many more zits than before. Lily gains some sympathy for Jenny and tells RJ about Jenny and they come up with a plan to sneak her out of the school. Lily, Miles, RJ and Jenny grab the mascot costume and attempt to sneak out, Breakfast Club-esque style. Miles runs a diversion, leaving Jenny and RJ to sneak off to his house. While Jenny and RJ kill time there, Lily discovers Robin placed some cream in Jenny's make-up to give her zits. Lily hates this and places some of that cream in her make-up and gives it to the other cheerleaders, embarassing them completely for their cheerleading photo.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n  |                  |                    |                |\n5 | Deadliest Crotch | Seth Grahame-Smith | April 18, 2011 |\n\nRJ's grade starts to suffer due to his life crumbling around him. Jenny tries to tell RJ that her parents are out of town for the weekend and says that she wants to lose her virginity then. Meanwhile, Miles gets into trouble with the hot substitute math teacher and has to stay after class. When RJ and his parents come to a parent teacher conference with Coach Sinclair, it is decided that RJ gets a tutor to help. RJ meets up with his tutor Amy and is shocked at how hot she is and fantasises about her. Amy calls her on it and he tells her what is happening in his life. Miles heads to the substitute's room and she ends up wanting to have sex with Miles. Stunned, Miles tells RJ the good news and has sex with her the next day in the janitor's closet. Jenny tries to tell RJ about the weekend then she meets Amy and leaves before she can. Amy asks RJ why Jenny is with him and he can't come up with an answer. Later on, Miles pulls a bug from his crotch and RJ tells him that it's a crab. In denial, Miles ends up grabbing another and admits that he does have crabs. Miles then comes to the conclusion that he will shave off his pubic hairs in order to have sex with the substitute again but later vows not to have sex again with her and tells her that they are through. Jenny tries to ask Lily what it's like to have sex and Lily ends up telling her that she and RJ had sex. RJ tells Miles that he has doubt about him and Jenny but Miles reassures him. Lily comes up to RJ, telling him that she told Jenny about RJ and her. Jenny soon follows and says that RJ is not who she thought he was. Jenny leaves with RJ in a depression.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n  |             |                    |                |\n6 | Saving Dick | Seth Grahame-Smith | April 25, 2011 |\n\nRJ's relationship with Jenny is suffering over RJ not telling her about him and Lily. RJ tries to ask his dad for help but Rick appears to be very delusional. Amy provides RJ with advice about his parents divorce and RJ gets her to help give Rick a makeover. RJ thanks Amy for her help, but Amy asks why he didn't ask Jenny for her help and RJ says he doesn't want her to see his dad like that. Lily attends a student bonding club which helps her with her inner most feelings, until Miles joins in and ruins her ability to heal from her emotional wounds. Later on, RJ tries to soothe things over with Jenny but she dejects him before he can get enough in. Miles tries to get close to the support group leader Katie while Lily gets close to the thug Hamilton, who appears to have an attraction towards Lily. Katie reveals to Miles that she used to have a very sexual side to her and Miles attempts to rekindle that state. Afterwards, Rick appears and tells RJ and Miles that he is the new substitute English teacher. The next day, Miles attempts to make a joke about Lily in the group but Hamilton defends Lily, then Miles is asked to leave the group. In the English class where Rick is teaching, he calls on RJ and Jenny to act out &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; to not only demonstrate it, but try to help them rekindle their romance. Rick inadvertently gives RJ the idea that Jenny and him are only meant to be friends and the both agree that they should go back to the way they were so RJ doesn't hurt her again. Later that night, Amy video chats RJ and says that he owes her one. Suzanne comes by and says she's going out with someone. When RJ asks who, she reveals that her and Coach Sinclair are starting a relationship.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n  |                     |              |             |\n7 | You, Me, and Weezer | Ryan Shiraki | May 2, 2011 |\n\nRJ wakes up to see Suzanne and Coach Sinclair the day after their night out. RJ saddens her when he asks her why she isn't speaking to Rick. Sinclair says to RJ that he's genuinely into Suzanne and plans on making a relationship with her. At school, Lily and her new boyfriend Hamilton have tickets to the Weezer concert that's coming into town and RJ thinks that is the perfect way to get Amy to notice him. Things go well until Amy points out that the show is for people over 21. Desperate for fake ID's, RJ asks Coach Sinclair for help getting them in exchange RJ tells Coach Sinclair what to give Suzanne as a special gift. Despite the address being in a shady part of town, RJ and Miles go up to the house and knock on the door, asking for 'Fidel'. The thuggish man who answers the door pulls RJ and Miles in. RJ and Miles say that Coach Sinclair sent them and they attempt to get the ID's until the cops show up. RJ grabs the box of ID's as they both head out the back door and a montage of the boys enjoying the new ID's. RJ shows Amy the new ID's and is excited to go to the sold out show, which is what RJ had no idea about. Desperate to get tickets, RJ can't seem to come up with a way to get tickets, until Coach Sinclair comes through with them and RJ admits that his mom is allergic to tulips and Sinclair admits he called the cops on the house they were in. When attempting to get in, Max shows up and foils RJ, Miles and Amy's plan to get in. While the show goes on, RJ finds a way into the back lot and sneaks into the show in an instrument case, only to be stopped by the bouncer he met earlier that threw the three out initially. RJ tries to reason with the bouncer and Weezer appears and overhears that RJ did this all for Amy. Weezer sympathizes with him and agrees to let him in on the stage. Weezer comes back in for an encore and dedicates the song &quot;Hang On&quot; for Amy and RJ and nerds everywhere. RJ notices Jenny in the audience and they wave to each other. Lily and Hamilton make out during the show and Amy turns to RJ and gives him a kiss.\n\nGuest Stars: Weezer \n___________________________________________________________________________________\n  |             |              |             |\n8 | Give Me a P | Ryan Shiraki | May 9, 2011 |\n\nRJ has a dream about him and Sinclair in an 'Inception' based sequence which has RJ telling Sinclair to stay away from Suzanne. After RJ wakes up and has breakfast, Suzanne tells RJ it's her and Rick's 20th anniversary, prompting her to ask RJ to have a night to themselves. When RJ gets to school, Miles says he has had enough of himself being overweight and decides to lose some weight, although RJ is extremely skeptical about this. Later, Rick asks RJ to be with him on the anniversary night and RJ agrees, leaving him double-booked and confused as to what to do. Miles decides that the best way for him to both lose weight and get girls to notice him is to join the cheerleading squad. Amy comforts RJ and says he should try to please himself instead of others and decides to help RJ with moral support. Robin tries to lead the cheerleaders until Jenny shows up and a confrontation starts to brew until Miles interrupts and the girls are shocked to see him in uniform. When RJ tries to tell Rick the truth that he already was going to be with Suzanne that night, he lies and says he will be with Amy and will eventually be at Rick's later on. Scared about trying to stand up to Sinclair, Miles, Hamilton, Lily and Amy tell RJ to just give him a chance. Afterwards Miles attempts to pull off a cheerleading move with Merideth, whom is on her period, and spills blood on Miles as he holds her up, prompting him to run away in extreme disgust. Even though Miles fears the worst humiliation, RJ tries to console him but to no avail. Later on, Robin sabotage's Jenny's stunt and ends up hurting her ankle. Miles carries Jenny off to the nurse's office while Robin kicks them both off of the squad. That night, RJ introduces Amy to Sinclair and Suzanne and they enjoy a nice meal along with many bottles of wine while Rick prepares for RJ to arrive at his motel room. While the night goes on for RJ at Suzanne's apartment, Rick gets perpetually drunk and angry at RJ not showing up and ends up at Suzanne's apartment in his bathtowel. Rick tells off RJ leaving him to wonder if his nightmare will ever end.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n  |         |             |              |\n9 | Hunkeez | Jeff Melman | May 16, 2011 |\n\nIn an effort to try and gain some independence, RJ begs Rick for some help gaining his driver's license.

Lily holds a slumber party for Jenny and they enjoy their night together. Rick, disappointed that he can't get some quality time with RJ, storms off into the club and leaves the others behind. After some time, RJ, Miles and Amy decide to try to find Rick and enter the club. Disgusted as to their surroundings, they attempt to find Rick until the club owner turns RJ around and throws him onto the stage, thinking he's a stripper.

Teen. Candles. | Jeff Melman | May 23, 2011 |\n\nIt's RJ's birthday, but he's not too happy about it. For all the years of his life Max has bullied him every birthday he had and he this year he put a flour bomb in his locker thanks to Miles giving him the combination. Amy promised that RJ was going to get a &quot;birthday surprise&quot; if he manned up when it came to Max bullying him. So RJ decides to have a &quot;Max Bash&quot; where it's his birthday party but Max and his friends are not invited. Everything is set for the party at Rick's hotel and all the guests then start to arrive. Amy plays with her band at the party and RJ is in love more than ever. Meanwhile, Max and his crew decide to &quot;gatecrash&quot; the party by dressing up as nerds so they won't realize it's him. RJ and all the rest of his school friends are enjoying themselves, but Rick decides to say a few words which aren't that appropriate for everyone else in the audience, but then Suzanne comes onto the stage and also says the same content of words (how RJ was born). Soon after the speech, Max and his friends arrive and start trashing everything in the party and throw eggs at everyone. Max then confronts RJ with intentions to kill him but RJ tells Max that he has grown tired for 16 years worth of bullying and makes Max flee to Robin's house. Later, RJ and Amy are sitting on a table and RJ is blowing out his birthday candles. Amy asks if there was a wish and RJ comes back with saying &quot;It's about to come true...&quot; then they enjoy Amy's &quot;birthday surprise&quot;.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n   |                 |                  |              |\n11 | Steamy Surprise | David Katzenberg | May 30, 2011 |\n\nA normal day occurrs at Pinkerton High until RJ gets a flyer for the &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Pinkerton High&quot; with a contestant couple being RJ and Jenny. RJ wonders why he is not coupled with Amy, and so does she, resulting in her assuming RJ wrote them down and she storms off and says she doesn't want to talk to RJ. RJ is saddened that she doesn't want to talk to him and tries everything he can to get her to. Meanwhile, RJ and Miles assume that Sinclair is cheating on Suzanne and attempts to prove it so. After rummaging through his desk, they find some incriminating photos of him, a woman and a lizard. When they bring it to Suzanne, she says it is her in the photos and RJ leaves to wash his eyes with soap. Suzanne tries to console RJ with little effect. The next day, Jenny, Lily, Hamilton and Miles admit that they forged RJ's signature on the application form for the contest and only did it to help him stand up and bring down Max and Robin once and for all. With this revelation, he attempts to tell Amy this but she dejects him before the message can get through. RJ heads to the locker room to sort things out in his head and hears something in the shower. He finds Guillermo, a gay student in the school and Max is walking up behind him. Thinking of the worst, RJ tries to warn him until Max turns Guillermo around and kisses him. RJ realizes that Max has been secretly gay and asks himself what is going on.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n   |                |                  |              |\n12 | The Better Man | David Katzenberg | May 30, 2011 |\n\nAfter RJ learns of Max's secret in the shower, he is unsure what to do. When he arrives at school the next day, Max attempts to beat RJ for continuing to run in the &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Pinkerton High&quot; until RJ whispers to Max that he knows about his secret. As a result, Max lays off and the school wonders why. When his close circle of friends (Miles, Lily, Hamilton and Jenny) ask him, he pulls Jenny aside and tells him what he saw. Jenny is shocked but tells RJ that it makes sense because of her and Max's relationship never got too far. RJ and Jenny agree to keep it a secret and not to oust Max during his speech for the &quot;Pinkerton High&quot; contest. Meanwhile, Lily and Jenny forge a plan to ruin Robin and Max once and for all. Jenny bumps into Robin on purpose and she goes off on a rant that has Robin sleighting the student body. After she leaves, Jenny pulls out a cell phone, apparently recording the whole conversation. During that time, RJ tries to patch things up with Amy, but she seems too steamed that he's hanging out with Jenny too much to realize that RJ is in love with Amy. Later that night, Sinclair proposes to Suzanne but Rick and RJ storm in and Rick reads her the poem he wrote to her when the first had sex. Rick and Suzanne immediately make up and Sinclair storms out, vowing to RJ his comeuppance and RJ says he can live with it. The assembly for the speech comes and the contestants give their respective speeches. RJ's turn comes and he proclaims his love for Amy and they make up in the end, with Amy saying she loves him too. Hamilton has Lily's cellphone with the recorded message and wonders where she is. After the speeches, Miles and him head to the AV room and play the message when Max and Robin win the contest. The crowd boos them and throws food at them, leaving RJ and Jenny to win. Lily comes in sobbing and tells RJ that she is pregnant with his baby. RJ is shocked and tells himself that he will become a daddy.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNFO:\n___\n\nthe COMPLETE season 2.. all 12 episodes [HDTV] by FQM N ASAP\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot:\n____\n\nThe Hard Times of RJ Berger orbits the hilariously-hellish lives of a deeply unpopular 15 year-old (Paul Iacono) and his scheming, sex-obsessed best friend, Miles Jenner (Jareb Dauplaise).
