Enjoy\n\nThe film is based on a novel by Mary Rodgers, in which mother and daughter switch bodies and get a taste of each others&amp;#039; lives. The cause of the switch is left unexplained in this film, but occurs when Mrs. Andrews and Annabel, in two different places, say about each other at the same time &quot;I wish I could switch places with her for just one day.&quot; Rogers adds a waterskiing subplot to her screenplay. The cast includes John Astin, Ruth Buzzi, Dick Van Patten, and Charlene Tilton.\n\nNeither Barbara Harris nor Jodie Foster did any actual waterskiing in the film. In both cases, these scenes were achieved with the use of professional waterskiiers in long shot on location, and cutaway shots of the actresses in front of a green-screen projection. Foster did, however, play field hockey in the film.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79d82448bd1a59c55df5355edf3c19f4c263a08c","amp;dn":"Disney+Movie+-+Freaky+Friday+%281976%29+Jodie+Foster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79d82448bd1a59c55df5355edf3c19f4c263a08c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,216,36,72,189,26,89,197,93,245,53,94,223,60,25,244,194,99,160,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
