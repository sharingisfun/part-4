Many guys devote so many hours to lifting weight yet end up with so little to show for it. In many cases, the problem is simple: They arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t doing exercises based on the movements their bodies were designed to do. Six basic movementsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the squat, deadlift, lunge, push, pull, and twistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½use all of the bodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s major muscles. And, more important, they use those muscles in coordinated action, the way they were designed to work.\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:285be04a02e1eb17abbd477dc95ca9f59afecc6e","amp;dn":"The+New+Rules+of+Lifting%3A+Six+Basic+Moves+for+Maximum+Muscle+-Ma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"285be04a02e1eb17abbd477dc95ca9f59afecc6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,91,224,74,2,225,235,23,171,189,71,125,201,92,169,245,154,254,204,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
