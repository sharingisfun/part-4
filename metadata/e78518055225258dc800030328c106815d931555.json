Rock and jazz fans from all over the world tuned into the Mahavishnu Orchestra.\nThe Mahavishnu Orchestra offered jazz-rock anthems. The band's tunes were carefully built, musical brick by musical brick. Fully fleshed-out themes filled the ears, and the rhythmic intensity was strangely comforting. This album was recorded LOUD. &quot;Birds of Fire,&quot; which opens up the album, is a fusion classic.\n\nThe Inner Mounting Flame and Birds of Fire set the standard for great fusion music in the 1970's. \n\n\n\n The Mahavishnu Orchestra\n with John Mclaughlin\n\n Birds of Fire\n\n 1973\n\n \n\n CD / 2000 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\n\n Tracklist:\n\n 1.
