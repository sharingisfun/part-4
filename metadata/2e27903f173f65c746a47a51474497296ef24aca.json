I have little use for managing company projects, so if you have difficulty with the activator, you should inquire on the thread there at MDL.\n\nChances are, though, if you actually use this program, you'll be buying it. Consider this like a fully working test version. If you actually use this stuff, you really should support Microsoft and pay for it. After all, if you don't, they'll stop making it.\n\nVL versions support KMS and VolumeMAK activation. If you want a retail version, you need to look for digitalriver links or something. There will never be a retail activator, so don't bother looking for one.\n\nEnjoy,\nmurphy78 MDL/TPB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e27903f173f65c746a47a51474497296ef24aca","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Project+Pro+2013+SP1+VL+x64+en-US","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e27903f173f65c746a47a51474497296ef24aca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,39,144,63,23,63,101,199,70,164,122,81,71,68,151,41,110,242,74,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
