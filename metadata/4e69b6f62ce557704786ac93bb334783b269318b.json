In particular, they must be well-versed in electromagnetic compatibility, which minimizes and controls the side effects of interconnected electric devices.\n\nDesigned to entice the practical engineer to explore some worthwhile mathematical methods, and to reorient the theoretical scientist to industrial applications, Electromagnetic Theory for Electromagnetic Compatibility Engineers is based on the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s courses taught in industrial settings. The book is a mathematically rigorous exposition of electromagnetic theory with applications in electromagnetic compatibility and high-speed digital design.\n\nThe topicsÃ¢â‚¬â€ranging from Maxwell's theory and multi-conductor transmission line theory to S-matrix, antenna theory, and dielectric breakdownÃ¢â‚¬â€were chosen because they have direct relevance to current electromagnetic compatibility problems encountered in the real world. With many worked examples and problem sets, the book relates the theory to practical experiences faced by practitioners. It is written both for physicists and mathematicians new to the field of electromagnetic compatibility and high-speed digital design, as well as established researchers in the field. It is also designed as an advanced undergraduate textbook for a course in electromagnetic theory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e69b6f62ce557704786ac93bb334783b269318b","amp;dn":"Electromagnetic+Theory+for+Electromagnetic+Compatibility+Enginee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e69b6f62ce557704786ac93bb334783b269318b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,105,182,246,44,229,87,112,71,134,172,147,187,51,71,131,178,105,49,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
