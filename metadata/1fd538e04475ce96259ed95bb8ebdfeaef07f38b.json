The scan includes application paths, file extensions and associations, and installed software. Registry scan is quite thorough, meaning it can take a while to finish.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fd538e04475ce96259ed95bb8ebdfeaef07f38b","amp;dn":"AVG+PC+Tuneup+%282012%29+10.0.0.27+%2B+serial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fd538e04475ce96259ed95bb8ebdfeaef07f38b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,213,56,224,68,117,206,150,37,158,217,91,184,235,223,234,239,7,243,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
