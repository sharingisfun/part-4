Known for the spontaneity and creativity of his live performances, Hornsby draws frequently from classical, jazz, bluegrass, folk, Motown, rock, blues, and jam band musical traditions with his songwriting and the seamless improvisations contained within.\n\nHornsby's recordings have been recognised on a number of occasions with industry awards, including the Best New Artist Grammy in 1987 with Bruce Hornsby and the Range, the Best Bluegrass Recording Grammy in 1989, and the Best Pop Instrumental Grammy in 1993.\n\nHornsby has also achieved recognition for his solo albums and performances, his current live act Bruce Hornsby &amp; the Noise Makers, his bluegrass project with Ricky Skaggs, his jazz act The Bruce Hornsby Trio, and his appearances as a session- and guest-musician. He also collaborated with the Grateful Dead and was a part time member of the band from September 1990 to April 1992.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Way It Is 1986\n\n\nThe Way It Is is Bruce Hornsby and the Range's debut album, released in 1986. Led by its hit title track, the album went on to achieve multi-platinum status and helped the group to win the Grammy Award for Best New Artist. Other hits from the album include &quot;Mandolin Rain&quot; and &quot;Every Little Kiss&quot;. Fellow musician Huey Lewis is also featured on the album, lending his harmonica and vocal talents to the track, &quot;Down the Road Tonight&quot;. Lewis also helped produce the song, along with the track, &quot;The Long Race&quot; and &quot;The River Runs Low&quot;.\n\nIn Japan, The Way It Is Tour, consisting of live performances of six songs from the album, was released for promotional purposes. The now out-of-print album was made available on vinyl and Compact Disc.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;On the Western Skyline&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:42\n2.\t&quot;Every Little Kiss&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:48 (Bruce Hornsby)\n3.\t&quot;Mandolin Rain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:19\n4.\t&quot;The Long Race&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25\n5.\t&quot;The Way It Is&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:58 (Bruce Hornsby)\n6.\t&quot;Down the Road Tonight&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:26\n7.\t&quot;The Wild Frontier&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04\n8.\t&quot;The River Runs Low&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27\n9.\t&quot;The Red Plains&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenes From  The Southside 1988\n\n\nScenes from the Southside is the second album by Bruce Hornsby and the Range. The single &quot;The Valley Road&quot; was Hornsby's third (and last) Top 10 U.S. hit, peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100, and also his first number one on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart. It became his third chart-topper on the Billboard adult contemporary chart, following &quot;The Way It Is&quot; and &quot;Mandolin Rain&quot;. Two other notable tracks on the record were &quot;The Show Goes On&quot;, which was featured in Ron Howard's 1991 film Backdraft, and &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot;, which was written by Bruce and John Hornsby, but is most well-known as being a number one hit for Huey Lewis and The News in March of 1987.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Look Out Any Window&quot; 5:28\n2.\t&quot;The Valley Road&quot; 4:42\n3.\t&quot;I Will Walk with You&quot; 4:34\n4.\t&quot;The Road Not Taken&quot; (Bruce Hornsby) 7:06\n5.\t&quot;The Show Goes On&quot; (Bruce Hornsby) 7:30\n6.\t&quot;The Old Playground&quot; 4:25\n7.\t&quot;Defenders of the Flag&quot; 4:27\n8.\t&quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot; 4:35\n9.\t&quot;Till the Dreaming's Done&quot; (Bruce Hornsby) 5:13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Night On The Town 1990\n\nBruce Hornsby and the Range's third and final album is titled A Night On The Town.
