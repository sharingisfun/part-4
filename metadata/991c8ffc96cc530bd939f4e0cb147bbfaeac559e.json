Her discussion of the use of PPBS (since the sixties) to bring about a revolution in education and to implement Educational Planning, with its Goals and Objectives predetermined at the international (UN/UNESCO) level, should be of interest to parents and teachers as well as they battle the unconstitutionally mandated No Child Left Behind Legislation, with its accompanying federally-mandated assessment, curriculum, and teacher training. Heaton discusses extensively the dangers to our representative form of government through regional government, â€œcitizen participationâ€ at the local, state, and federal levels in which unelected, carefully-selected persons are chosen to make decisions which affect all Americans. This change is of utmost importance as Americans observe their constitutional republican system of government, with its important checks and balances, being subverted through regionalism, usually in the name of so-called â€œefficiencyâ€ and â€œaccountabilityâ€ â€¦to whom?â€¦ one might well ask.\r\n\r\nAs Heaton said shortly before she passed away: â€œYou know whatâ€™s wrong in your world. This book is about how your world got that way, and how to fix it.â€","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:991c8ffc96cc530bd939f4e0cb147bbfaeac559e","amp;dn":"Maureen+Heaton+-+The+Impossible+Dream+-+pdf+%5BTKRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"991c8ffc96cc530bd939f4e0cb147bbfaeac559e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,28,143,252,150,204,83,11,217,57,244,224,203,20,123,191,174,172,85,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
