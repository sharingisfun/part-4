In recent years it has been named to Ã¢â‚¬Å“best novelsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ lists by Time, Newsweek, the Modern Library, and the London Observer.\n\nSet in Italy during World War II, this is the story of the incomparable, malingering bombardier, Yossarian, a hero who is furious because thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him. But his real problem is not the enemyÃ¢â‚¬â€it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assigned, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.\nClosing Time:\nIn Closing Time, Joseph Heller returns to the characters of Catch-22, now coming to the end of their lives and the century, as is the entire generation that fought in World War II: Yossarian and Milo Minderbinder, the chaplain, and such newcomers as little Sammy Singer and giant Lew, all linked, in an uneasy peace and old age, fighting not the Germans this time, but The End. Closing Time deftly satirizes the realities and the myths of America in the half century since WWII: the absurdity of our politics, the decline of our society and our great cities, the greed and hypocrisy of our business and culture -- with the same ferocious humor as Catch-22.     \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.69books.com/2015/07/joseph-heller-catch-22-series.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.69books.com/2015/07/joseph-heller-catch-22-series.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43d0b65290686e026bc0df18eada38d11edc0bf1","amp;dn":"Joseph+Heller%3A+Catch-22+series+%28Closing+Time%29++pdf%2C+epub%2C+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43d0b65290686e026bc0df18eada38d11edc0bf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,208,182,82,144,104,110,2,107,192,223,24,234,218,56,209,30,220,11,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
