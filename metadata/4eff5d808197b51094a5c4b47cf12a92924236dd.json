Snowden has been working at the National Security Agency for the last four years as an employee of various outside contractors, including Booz Allen and Dell.\n\nThe Guardian, after several days of interviews, is revealing his identity at his request. From the moment he decided to disclose numerous top-secret documents to the public, he was determined not to opt for the protection of anonymity. &quot;I have no intention of hiding who I am because I know I have done nothing wrong,&quot; he said.\n\nSnowden will go down in history as one of America's most consequential whistleblowers, alongside Daniel Ellsberg and Bradley Manning. He is responsible for handing over material from one of the world's most secretive organisations Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the NSA.\n\nIn a note accompanying the first set of documents he provided, he wrote: &quot;I understand that I will be made to suffer for my actions,&quot; but &quot;I will be satisfied if the federation of secret law, unequal pardon and irresistible executive powers that rule the world that I love are revealed even for an instant.&quot;\n\nDespite his determination to be publicly unveiled, he repeatedly insisted that he wants to avoid the media spotlight. &quot;I don't want public attention because I don't want the story to be about me. I want it to be about what the US government is doing.&quot;\n\nHe does not fear the consequences of going public, he said, only that doing so will distract attention from the issues raised by his disclosures. &quot;I know the media likes to personalise political debates, and I know the government will demonise me.&quot;\n\nDespite these fears, he remained hopeful his outing will not divert attention from the substance of his disclosures. &quot;I really want the focus to be on these documents and the debate which I hope this will trigger among citizens around the globe about what kind of world we want to live in.&quot; He added: &quot;My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4eff5d808197b51094a5c4b47cf12a92924236dd","amp;dn":"Edward+Snowden+-+NSA+Whistleblower%3A+PRISM+Conspiracy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4eff5d808197b51094a5c4b47cf12a92924236dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,255,93,128,129,151,181,16,148,165,196,180,124,241,42,146,146,66,54,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
