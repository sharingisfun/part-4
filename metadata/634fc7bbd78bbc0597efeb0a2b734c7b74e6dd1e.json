Suzanne Vega not only managed that feat on her unlikely, child-abuse themed breakthrough hit &quot;Luka&quot; in Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ88, but opened the door for a renaissance of intelligent, female folk-oriented music in the decade that followed. This 21-track anthology spans Vega's career before and since, a chronicle of cool, sharp-eyed detachment infused by a restless, oft-underrated sense of musical invention that spans club-mixes (the &quot;Tom's Diner&quot; here was originally a &quot;pirate&quot; deejay mix by DNA that Vega wisely adopted), Latin jazz (&quot;Caramel&quot;), electro-percussive rhythm explorations (&quot;Blood Makes Noise,&quot; &quot;99.9F,&quot; and &quot;&quot;Woman on the Tier&quot; from the Dead Man Walking soundtrack) neo-classicism (&quot;Small Blue Thing&quot;) and a sharp-edged pop sense (&quot;I'll Never Be Your Maggie May,&quot; &quot;Book of Dreams&quot;) that can't be denied. That it's all still clearly rooted in a diverse pantheon that includes Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, and Woody Guthrie is all the more remarkable. Rarities include &quot;Left of Center&quot; from the Pretty in Pink soundtrack, a live &quot;Queen and the Soldier&quot; and previously import-only &quot;Rosemary.&quot; Also features all lyrics and the insightful recollections of Vega colleague/Patti Smith guitarist Lenny Kaye.\nBy Jerry McCulley.\n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Tom's Diner\n[02] Luka - - - DNA Featuring Suzanne Vega\n[03] Marlene On The Wall\n[04] Caramel\n[05] 99.9 F\n[06] Tired Of Sleeping\n[07] Small Blue Thing\n[08] Blood Makes Noise\n[09] Left Of Center\n[10] (I'll Never Be) Your Maggie May\n[11] In Liverpool\n[12] Gypsy\n[13] Book Of Dreams\n[14] No Cheap Thrill\n[15] Calypso\n[16] World Before Columbus\n[17] Solitude Standing\n[18] Penitent\n[19] Rosemary\n[20] The Queen And The Soldier [Live]\n[21] Woman On The Tier (I'll See You Through)\n\nCD Play Time - 01h:17m:49s\n\n[b]Total File Size....................... 500mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
