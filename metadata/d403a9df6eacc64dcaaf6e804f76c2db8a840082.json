Composed of identical twin sisters Tegan Rain Quin and Sara Keirsten Quin (born September 19, 1980). Both play the guitar and keyboards, and write their own songs; with occasional collaborations starting in 2009 and increasing with each new album. Their music can be described as various combinations of indie rock, new wave, indie pop, indie folk, and electro. Their music has taken a definite electronic leaning as of late, to mixed reaction from fans. It's up to you whether you like it, but if you do please keep them going and support the artist!! All of their albums are stellar, definitely check them out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d403a9df6eacc64dcaaf6e804f76c2db8a840082","amp;dn":"Tegan+and+Sara+-+Closer+-+New+Single+2012+-+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d403a9df6eacc64dcaaf6e804f76c2db8a840082","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,3,169,223,110,172,198,77,202,175,110,128,79,118,194,219,138,132,0,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
