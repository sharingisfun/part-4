Foster initially began the project alone, before he added long-term friend Cubbie Fink on bass and drummer Mark Pontius to complete the lineup. The following year, single &quot;Pumped Up Kicks&quot; was posted on their website, picking up considerable buzz online and significant airplay on KROQ, alongside packed performances at Texas music showcase SXSW. This inevitably garnered the attention of the major labels, and eventually the band signed to Columbia imprint Startime International. Early in 2011 they released a self-titled EP that featured &quot;Pumped Up Kicks&quot; -- and with the major-label support the song became a worldwide hit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4ef315f81e2f3637db579b1449721cf412a9e23","amp;dn":"Foster+the+People+-+Supermodel+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4ef315f81e2f3637db579b1449721cf412a9e23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,239,49,95,129,226,243,99,125,181,121,177,68,151,33,207,65,42,158,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
