For most of its existence, Everclear has consisted of Art Alexakis (vocals &amp; guitar), Craig Montoya (bass guitar &amp; vocals), and Greg Eklund (drums, percussion &amp; vocals). Eklund replaced original drummer Scott Cuthbert in 1994. Montoya and Eklund departed the band in 2003, but \nAlexakis continued the band with Dave &quot;Davey&quot; French (guitar), Josh Crawley (keyboards), Sam Hudson (bass guitar), and Tommy Stewart (drums, percussion). However all members except for Alexakis left the band in July 2009 to be replaced with a 3rd lineup of Everclear.\n\n1. Wonderful  \t                                      \t\n2.
