The provision of multiple high quality surgical and pathological photographs makes it essential reading for cardiac surgeons, and of great value to cardiologists, surgical pathologists, radiologists and anaesthetists. The book will also be a valuable reference resource for any healthcare professional or researcher who needs to understand detailed cardiac anatomy. The book begins by describing the surgical approaches to the heart. It goes on to discuss the normal surgical anatomy of the cardiac chambers, the valves, and the systems for circulation and conduction within the heart. This provides the essential anatomical information required to assess and interpret the malformations, lesions and abnormalities discussed in the remainder of the book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c84b8a15c478cc507eb6b36ca9828fc78e7254a","amp;dn":"Wilcox%26rsquo%3Bs+Surgical+Anatomy+of+the+Heart+4th+Ed+%5BPDF%5D%5Btahir9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c84b8a15c478cc507eb6b36ca9828fc78e7254a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,132,184,161,92,71,140,197,7,235,107,54,202,152,40,252,120,231,37,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
