No other textbook matches its scope and depth of coverage in this complex and challenging area of surgical pathology, and no other text contains as much practical information on differential diagnosis. Throughout, microscopic findings are correlated with the latest developments in molecular biology, cytogenetics, and immunohistochemistry to provide you with a comprehensive and integrated approach to evaluation and diagnosis. Almost 2,000 superb illustrations capture the appearance of a complete range of entities and help relate these to their specific classifications. The result is an essential resource for all who diagnose and treat soft tissue tumors.\n\nGet all the assistance you need, in one reference, to effectively diagnose these often complex and challenging entities.\nConfirm your diagnostic suspicions by comparing your findings to nearly 2,000 full-color, high-quality illustrations representing the complete range of soft tissue tumors.\nAccess all of the essential clinical and prognostic data necessary to formulate complete sign-out reports.\nMake optimal use of relevant ancillary techniques such as immunohistochemistry and cytogenetics.\nMake rapid and effective decisions with the aid of extensive algorithms, and access information at a glance with abundant tables and graphs.\nSolve difficult diagnostic dilemmas and avoid pitfalls with a special emphasis on overcoming these challenges.\nFind answers quickly thanks to a new color-coded page design as well as a consistent approach to every entity.\n\nDownload all of the illustrations from the book for use in electronic presentations with the new bonus CD-ROM.\nApply the latest knowledge on FNA biopsy, molecular biology, and cytogenetics.\nUnderstand complex molecular events more fully thanks to new conceptual line drawings.\nEasily distinguish between entities that have a similar appearance with the assistance of new tables that correlate histologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular biologic findings.\nNavigate through the book quickly thanks to new summary outlines at the beginning of each chapter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc8c7096b6ee1d3da1353dede965a9e89abd6c83","amp;dn":"Enzinger+and+Weiss%26rsquo%3Bs+Soft+Tissue+Tumors+5th+Ed+%5BPDF%5D%5Btahir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc8c7096b6ee1d3da1353dede965a9e89abd6c83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,140,112,150,182,238,29,61,161,53,61,237,233,101,169,232,154,189,108,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
