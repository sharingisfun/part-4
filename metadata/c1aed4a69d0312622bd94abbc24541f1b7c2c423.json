NOW ALL HELL'S BREAKING LOOSE.\n\nFor two thousand years the Triarii have protected us, influencing history from the crusades to the discovery of America. Descendent from the Roman Empire, they pervade every level of society, and are now in a race with our own government to retrieve an ancient artifact thought to have been lost forever.\n\nCaught in the middle is archaeology professor James Acton, relentlessly hunted by the elite Delta Force, under orders to stop at nothing to possess what he has found, and the Triarii, equally determined to prevent the discovery from falling into the wrong hands.\n\nWith his students and friends dying around him, Acton flees to find the one person who might be able to help him, but little does he know he may actually be racing directly into the hands of an organization he knows nothing about...\n\nBrass Monkey (2011)\n(The second book in the James Acton Thrillers series)\n\nA FORGOTTEN NUKE, A SACRED TARGET...\n\nA nuclear missile, lost during the Cold War, is now in play--the most public spy swap in history, with a gorgeous agent the center of international attention, triggers the end-game of a corrupt Soviet Colonel's twenty five year plan. Pursued across the globe by the Russian authorities, including a brutal Spetsnaz unit, those involved will stop at nothing to deliver their weapon, and ensure their pay day, regardless of the terrifying consequences.\n\nWhen Professor Laura Palmer confronts a UNICEF group for trespassing on her Egyptian archaeological dig site, she unwittingly stumbles upon the ultimate weapons deal, and becomes entangled in an international conspiracy that sends her lover, archeology Professor James Acton, racing to Egypt with the most unlikely of allies, not only to rescue her, but to prevent the start of a holy war that could result in Islam and Christianity wiping each other out.\n\n\nBroken Dove (2012)\n(The third book in the James Acton Thrillers series)\n\nA MURDER IN THE VATICAN IS JUST THE BEGINNING...\n\nWith the Triarii in control of the Roman Catholic Church, an organization founded by Saint Peter himself takes action, murdering one of the new Pope's operatives. Detective Chaney, called in by the Pope to investigate, disappears, and, to the horror of the Papal staff sent to inform His Holiness, they find him missing too, the only clue a secret chest, presented to each new pope on the eve of their election, since the beginning of the Church.\n\nInterpol Agent Reading, determined to find his friend, calls Professors James Acton and Laura Palmer to Rome to examine the chest and its forbidden contents, but before they can arrive, they are intercepted by an organization older than the Church, demanding the professors retrieve an item stolen in ancient Judea in exchange for the lives of their friends.\n\nAll of your favorite characters from The Protocol return to solve the most infamous kidnapping in history, against the backdrop of a two thousand year old battle pitting ancient foes with diametrically opposed agendas.\n\n\n\nThe Templar's Relic (2012)\n(The fourth book in the James Acton Thrillers series)\n\n\nAN ISLAMIC FLAG WILL FLY OVER THE VATICAN... \n\nThe Church Helped Destroy the Templars.\nWill a twist of fate let them get their revenge 700 years later?\n\nA construction accident leads to a miraculous discovery--an ancient tomb containing four Templar Knights, long forgotten, on the grounds of the Vatican. Not knowing who they can trust, the Vatican requests Professors James Acton and Laura Palmer examine the find, but what they discover, a precious Islamic relic, lost during the Crusades, triggers a set of events that shake the entire world, pitting the two greatest religions against each other.\n\nJoin Professors James Acton and Laura Palmer, INTERPOL Agent Hugh Reading, Scotland Yard DI Martin Chaney, and the Delta Force Bravo Team as they race against time to defuse a worldwide crisis that could quickly devolve into all-out war.\n\nAt risk is nothing less than the Vatican itself, and the rock upon which it was built.\n\n\n book 5, Flags of Sin.\n\n\nArchaeology Professor James Acton simply wants to get away from everything, and relax. A trip to China seems just the answer, and he and his fiancÃƒÂ©e, Professor Laura Palmer, are soon on a flight to Beijing.\n\nBut while boarding, they bump into an old friend, Delta Force Command Sergeant Major Burt Dawson, who surreptitiously delivers a message that they must meet the next day, for Dawson knows something they don't.\n\nChina is about to erupt into chaos.\n\nForeign tourists and diplomats are being targeted by unknown forces, and if they don't get out of China in time, they could be caught up in events no one had seen coming.\n\nJ. Robert Kennedy, the author of twelve international best sellers, including the smash hit James Acton Thrillers, takes history once again and turns it on its head, sending his reluctant heroes James Acton and Laura Palmer into harm's \n\nway, to not only save themselves, but to try and save a country from a century old conspiracy it knew nothing about.\n\n\nThe Arab Fall (2013)\n(The sixth book in the James Acton Thrillers series)\nA novel by J Robert Kennedy\n\n\nTHE GREATEST ARCHEOLOGICAL DISCOVERY SINCE KING TUT'S TOMB IS ABOUT TO BE DESTROYED!\n\nThe Arab Spring has happened and Egypt has yet to calm down, but with the dig site on the edge of the Nubian Desert, a thousand miles from the excitement, Professor Laura Palmer and her fiancÃƒÂ© Professor James Acton return with a group of students, and two friends: Interpol Special Agent Hugh Reading, and Scotland Yard Detective Inspector Martin Chaney. It's work for the professors and their students, and a vacation for the two law enforcement officers, but as Reading quickly discovers, he and the desert don't mix, and Chaney is preoccupied with a message he has been asked to deliver to the professor by his masters in the Triarii.\n\nBut an accidental find by Chaney may lead to the greatest archaeological discovery since the tomb of King Tutankhamen, perhaps even greater. And when news of it spreads, it reaches the ears of a group hell-bent on the destruction of all idols and icons, their mere existence considered blasphemous to Islam.\n\nAs chaos hits the major cities of the world in a coordinated attack, unbeknownst to the professors, students and friends, they are about to be faced with one of the most difficult decisions of their lives.\n\nStay and protect the greatest archaeological find of our times, or save themselves and their students from harm, leaving the find to be destroyed by fanatics determined to wipe it from the history books.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1aed4a69d0312622bd94abbc24541f1b7c2c423","amp;dn":"J.+Robert+Kennedy+-+James+Acton+Thrillers+%281+-+6%29+Epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1aed4a69d0312622bd94abbc24541f1b7c2c423","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,174,212,166,157,3,18,98,43,217,74,187,194,69,65,241,183,194,196,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
