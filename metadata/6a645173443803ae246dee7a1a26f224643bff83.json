The enigmatic anti-hero of Riddick is famous, of course, from the runaway sleeper hit of 2000--Pitch Black--and its sequel, The Chronicles of Riddick. This game takes place before either of the movies, filling in some of the backstory of RiddickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dark and dangerous past. Make a dramatic escape from Butcher Bay, the galaxy's deadliest prison, in this intense fusion of first-person shooter, fighter, and stealth adventure.\n\nThere is a rule that licensed games based on movies are typically, well, not too good. The Chronicles of Riddick does not simply break this rule, it obliterates the rule and dances on its still-warm ashes. Some even say that this game has greatly exceeded the movies it was based upon. David Twohy (the scriptwriter for both Riddick movies) and Vin Diesel both contributed to the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s development, assuring a maximum level of consistency with the world shown on the big screen. The level of polish is astonishing throughout the entire game. Gameplay is slick and intuitive, characters are interesting and Ã¢â‚¬Å“aliveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and the combat is fun and visually realistic (which is a nice way of saying Ã¢â‚¬Å“bloodyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). So find for yourself it you have what it takes to not only survive in the most dangerous place in the universe, but also make it bow to your will.\n\nAge requirements: ESRB Rating: MATURE with Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Sexual Content, Strong Language.
