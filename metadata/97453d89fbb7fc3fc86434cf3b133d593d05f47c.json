The book is illustrated with step-by-step, detailed photographs of each stage of the assembly process. No advanced electronic or programming skills are required, making the book suitable for first-time experimenters. The emphasis is on the techniques needed to build the robot, rather than on the theory of robot design. Easy-to-read wiring diagrams are included, with beginners in mind, and the book also features a complete parts list, including tips on where to find inexpensive parts and components","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97453d89fbb7fc3fc86434cf3b133d593d05f47c","amp;dn":"Build+A+Remote-Controlled+Robot+-+David+R.+Shircliff+-+Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97453d89fbb7fc3fc86434cf3b133d593d05f47c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,69,61,137,251,183,252,63,200,100,52,207,59,19,61,89,61,5,244,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
