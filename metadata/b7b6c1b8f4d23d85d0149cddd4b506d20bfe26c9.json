Bob Dylan, George Harrison, the Stranglers, and the Velvet Underground are all awarded one song each, but the emphasis rarely strays from Murdoch's finger-picked guitar and solemn vocals, resulting in a consistent vibe that almost functions like a movie score. While the songwriter also contributes three unreleased songs to the project, Away We Go is too reminiscent of his existing albums to appeal to most Murdoch fans. Instead, this album caters to those who enjoyed the movie, as it offers up the same brand of wistful contemplation. ~ Andrew Leahey, All Music Guide\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hollywoodchicago.com/reviews/7938/away-we-go-from-sam-mendes-a-slightly-bumpy-trip-worth-taking&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hollywoodchicago.com/reviews/7938/away-we-go-from-sam-mendes-a-slightly-bumpy-trip-worth-taking&lt;/a&gt;\nA full review of the Sam Mendes movie starring John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph\n...\nPerfectly attuned to the subtleties of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAway We Go,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the soundtrack by new artist Alexi Murdoch *is* the movie.
