But when he investigates the crash, what he finds will yank him out of his self-imposed exile and thrust him into a world he could have never imagined.\n\nHe suddenly finds himself trapped on a damaged alien spacecraft and plunged into a universe of interstellar crime lords and government conspiracies, along the way meeting strange new friendsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and enemies. As he struggles to find his way back home he is inexorably drawn deeper into a world where one misstep could mean his death. Or worse. He desperately wants to get back to Earth, but it may be the end for him.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ or is it just the beginning?\n\nFormat: MP3\nNarrated by: Paul Heitsch\nLength: 6 hrs and 41 mins\nBitrate: 32 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6efcc5c811abcfcd77cd79f5e08f2d7562db1e87","amp;dn":"Joshua+Dalzelle+-+Omega+Rising+%28Omega+Force+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6efcc5c811abcfcd77cd79f5e08f2d7562db1e87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,252,197,200,17,171,207,205,119,205,121,245,224,143,45,117,98,219,30,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
