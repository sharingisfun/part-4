His raspy-voiced, jackleg preacher style also laid some of the most important parts of rap's foundation. He is, arguably, the most underrated of all the '60s soul performers associated with Atlantic Records, although his records were more likely than those of most soul stars to become crossover hits.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tSoul and R&amp;B\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Hold What You've Got\n02.You Got What It Takes\n03.You Better Get It\n04.A Woman Can Change A Man\n05.Don't Let Your Left Hand Know\n06.One Monkey Don't Stop No Show\n07.I Want To (Do Everything For You)\n08.A Sweet Woman Like You\n09.The Love You Save (Might Be Your Own)\n10.S.Y.S.L.J.F.M.
