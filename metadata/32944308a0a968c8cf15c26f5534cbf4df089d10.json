Fusing psychological realism and expressionism, his exploratory exercises teach actors to evoke past emotions that draw out their vulnerability. Stanislavski here introduces such concepts as the &quot;magic if,&quot; &quot;emotion memory,&quot; the &quot;unbroken line&quot; and many more now famous rehearsal aids. This classic manual is written from the viewpoint of fictional actors taking lessons from a director (based on Stanislavski). Through the student's mistakes, questions, revelations, and struggles, Stanislavski teaches the actor about the stage, truth, and life itself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32944308a0a968c8cf15c26f5534cbf4df089d10","amp;dn":"Stanislavski+1936+An+Actor+Prepares.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32944308a0a968c8cf15c26f5534cbf4df089d10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,148,67,8,160,169,104,200,207,21,194,111,85,52,203,244,223,8,157,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
