It's full of high-octane, shut-up-and-dance cuts like &quot;Ice Cream Dream,&quot; &quot;The Best Things In Life Are Free,&quot; &quot;Let's Get Together (So Groovy Now)&quot;, and &quot;Money Can't Buy You Love.&quot; In addition, the soundtrack also includes the an enchanted star-soaked ballad by Mint Condition entitled &quot;My Dear&quot; --I recommend listening to that song at night, it just evokes such beautiful imagery. Overall, Mo Money is one of the best (if the best) soundtracks of the 90s. Worth it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81e5594118708ddfa2a10a6ca0fd120da532067f","amp;dn":"Mo%27+Money+-+Soundtrack+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+1992+Rap+Hip+Hop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81e5594118708ddfa2a10a6ca0fd120da532067f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,229,89,65,24,112,141,223,162,161,10,108,160,253,18,13,165,50,6,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
