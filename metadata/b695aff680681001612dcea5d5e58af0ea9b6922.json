Now, two years later, Playlogic publishes World Racing 2. A significant increase in cars and car manufacturers has led to the dropping of ?Mercedes-Benz? from the title, and in World Racing 2 players can race with more than 90 cars from 17 well-known manufacturers, including Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Volkswagen and Alfa Romeo.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b695aff680681001612dcea5d5e58af0ea9b6922","amp;dn":"World+Racing+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b695aff680681001612dcea5d5e58af0ea9b6922","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,149,175,246,128,104,16,1,97,45,206,165,213,229,138,240,234,155,105,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
