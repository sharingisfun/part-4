Number one\nskill Ã¢â‚¬â€œ way ahead of the others Ã¢â‚¬â€œ was communication (84 per\ncent). Interestingly, numbers two and three Ã¢â‚¬â€œ motivating others\n(56 per cent) and team-building (46 per cent) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ also rely on\neffective communication. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more, 60 per cent of executives\nwho responded listed lack of collaboration\nas their top leadership challenge.\nManagement is no longer a matter of command and control.\nManagers must now work with matrix management and\nnetworking, with outsourcing and partnerships. We must\ninfluence people to act, often without being able to wield power\nover them. Our success depends,\nmore than ever before, on other people.\nThe new technologies have been a mixed blessing. IT helps us\nkeep in touch but can reduce our opportunities to talk to each\nother. Many of us have become Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcubicle workersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, spending most\nof our day interfacing with a computer screen.\nCorporate communication can, of course, still be remarkably.\n\n\n\nPages: 204\nLanguage: EN\nFormat: PDF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebe35e545d59a7a478bc73926a1586faebbac597","amp;dn":"Improve+Your+Communication+Skills.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebe35e545d59a7a478bc73926a1586faebbac597","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,227,94,84,93,89,167,164,120,188,115,146,106,21,134,250,235,186,197,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
