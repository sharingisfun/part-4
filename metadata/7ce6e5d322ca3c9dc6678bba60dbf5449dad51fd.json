He is portrayed as being the brains, while McCabe, though an excellent speech-writer, lacks his motivation and insight. McCabe's ambitions include retiring and drinking claret, and he spends his life in a state of cynicism, lack of energy and boredom. McCabe (who describes himself as &quot;a first class mind&quot; does sometimes have good ideas, but they usually become Prentiss' ideas by the time they are presented to the client, and he lacks the energy to make more than mild objections. McCabe is also more likely to balk at a scheme for moral reasons than Prentiss.\n\nThe third member of the company is Sandy, who is there as the office trainee, getting work experience for her NVQ level 2. She usually does all the work that the partners in the firm cannot be bothered to do, such as filling out thousands of public opinion polls in different handwritings, though she will only agree to do something if it can be twisted into one of the 'nine levels of competence' of her NVQ. \n\nCast:\nStephen Fry as Charles Prentiss \nJohn Bird as Martin McCabe \nSiobhan Hayes as Sandy \n\n\nAbsolute Power - S01 - E01 - Conservative Party\nAbsolute Power - S01 - E02 - Relaunch Of The Sun\nAbsolute Power - S01 - E03 - Mayor Of London\nAbsolute Power - S01 - E04 - The Church Of England\nAbsolute Power - S01 - E05 - Radio 3\nAbsolute Power - S01 - E06 - English Sporting Success\n\nAbsolute Power - S02 - E01 - Martin Is Bored\nAbsolute Power - S02 - E02 - Promoting Philosophy\nAbsolute Power - S02 - E03 - Relaunching A Literary Career\nAbsolute Power - S02 - E04 - The Elderly Initiative\nAbsolute Power - S02 - E05 - Prison Reform\nAbsolute Power - S02 - E06 - Gayle Shand\n\nAbsolute Power - S03 - E01 - Poking The PM\nAbsolute Power - S03 - E02 - Health Service\nAbsolute Power - S03 - E03 - Big Brother\nAbsolute Power - S03 - E04 - A Tennis Star\nAbsolute Power - S03 - E05 - Men\n\nAbsolute Power - S04 - E01 - The BBC\nAbsolute Power - S04 - E02 - The Notion Of Nation\nAbsolute Power - S04 - E03 - Healthy Eating\nAbsolute Power - S04 - E04 - US Presidential Campaign\nAbsolute Power - S04 - E05 - Special\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 54s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ce6e5d322ca3c9dc6678bba60dbf5449dad51fd","amp;dn":"Absolute+Power+-+S01+to+04+-+Radio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ce6e5d322ca3c9dc6678bba60dbf5449dad51fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,230,229,211,34,202,60,157,198,103,139,186,96,219,245,68,157,173,81,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
