Meditation needs to become &quot;real.&quot; It needs to align with the lives and interests of real people.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€from Search Inside Yourself\n\nEarly Google engineer and personal growth pioneer Chade-Meng Tan first designed Search Inside Yourself as a popular course at Google intended to transform the work and lives of the best and brightest behind one of the most innovative, successful, and profitable businesses in the world . . . and now it can do the same for you. Meng has distilled emotional intelligence into a set of practical and proven tools and skills that anyone can learn and develop.\n\nCreated in collaboration with a Zen master, a CEO, a Stanford University scientist, and Daniel Goleman (the guy who literally wrote the book on emotional intelligence), this program is grounded in science and expressed in a way that even a skeptical, compulsively pragmatic, engineering-oriented brain like Meng's can process. Whether your intention is to reduce stress and increase well-being, heighten focus and creativity, become more optimistic and resilient, build fulfilling relationships, or just be successful, the skills provided by Search Inside Yourself will prove invaluable for you. This is your guide to enhancing productivity and creativity, finding meaning and fulfillment in your work and life, and experiencing profound peace, compassion, and happiness while doing so.\n\nSearch Inside Yourself reveals how to calm your mind on demand and return it to a natural state of happiness, deepen self-awareness in a way that fosters self-confidence, harness empathy and compassion into outstanding leadership, and build highly productive collaborations based on trust and transparent communication. In other words, Search Inside Yourself shows you how to grow inner joy while succeeding at your work. Meng writes: &quot;Some people buy books that teach them to be liked; others buy books that teach them to be successful. This book teaches you both. You are so lucky.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dc71b24936df60e16a0ce21014479a5de21c98b","amp;dn":"Search+Inside+Yourself+-+Tan+Chade+Meng+%28Epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dc71b24936df60e16a0ce21014479a5de21c98b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,199,27,36,147,109,246,14,22,160,206,33,1,68,121,165,222,33,201,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
