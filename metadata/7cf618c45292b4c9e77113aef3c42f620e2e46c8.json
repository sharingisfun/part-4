Seeing your own hands crawling frantically under the couch makes you feel even more fragile.\n\n- Focused on story, not cheap scares. Merging a childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perception of reality with its wild imagination, lets you unravel what is actually causing your own fear and confusion.\n\n- Oculus Rift support. For the VR-fanatics, this feature will make sure you get as close to being a child again as you can.\n\n\nOverview:\n\n\nAmong the Sleep is a first person horror adventure, in which you play as a two year old child. After waking up in the middle of the night to mysterious sounds, you start a journey in the dark looking for your mother.\n\nThe game lets you experience the horror felt by a child when familiar and friendly surroundings are transformed into something sinister. While wandering around in surrealistic environments, you have only your teddy bear as a companion. There might be threats hiding in every shadow, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no traditional combat. Instead, you will actively have to find places to hide and avoid confrontation in order to survive. In Among the Sleep youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re vulnerable, scared, and trying to make sense of the world. Dark things will happen. How will you find comfort?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cf618c45292b4c9e77113aef3c42f620e2e46c8","amp;dn":"Among+The+Sleep+%28Latest+Version%29+%28Native%29+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cf618c45292b4c9e77113aef3c42f620e2e46c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,246,24,196,82,146,180,201,231,113,19,174,243,196,47,98,14,46,70,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
