Note: The current hack way of supporting these controllers may not work with the improved functionality. So we recommend you remove the hack before upgrading to the patch.\n\n\nIssues with power management software have also been fixed (slow speed, double speed issues). Even after the patch comes out setting power management software to maximum performance is recommended. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve seen cases where power management software does not detect the game is running and puts the CPU in green mode.\n\nBesides the patch weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve also improved the way the Social Club handles data this should have greatly reduced or eliminated the MMA10 error. If you are still receiving this error after logging in and out of Social Club we would like to know as much info as you can about it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:328d227604496fc2862d941d14d107aaa79e40cb","amp;dn":"GRAND+THEFT+AUTO+4+%28GTA4%29+Official+PC+Patch+%23+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"328d227604496fc2862d941d14d107aaa79e40cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,141,34,118,4,73,111,194,134,45,148,29,20,209,7,170,167,158,64,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
