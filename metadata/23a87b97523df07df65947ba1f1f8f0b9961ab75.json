From July 1985 to March 1986, a sequel, Secret Wars II, was published.\n\nThe series was conceived by Marvel Comics\\&amp;#039; Editor-in-chief Jim Shooter and primarily pencilled by Mike Zeck.\n\nThis is a request from the forum. Request was only for Secret Wars II, but I decided to do both I and II to make it a more complete post. You can also find these among various chronologies already uploaded. But if you want only Secret Wars then this is for you. Enjoy and Seed.
