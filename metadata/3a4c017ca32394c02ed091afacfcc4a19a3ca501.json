It was one of two albums released in conjunction with the Use Your Illusion Tour, and as a result the two albums are sometimes considered a double album. Bolstered by the lead single &quot;You Could Be Mine&quot;, \n\nUse Your Illusion II was the slightly more popular of the two albums, selling 770,000 copies its first week and debuting at No. 1 on the U.S. charts, ahead of Use Your Illusion I's first week sales of 685,000. \n\nBoth albums have since been certified 7Ãƒâ€” Platinum by the RIAA. It was also No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart for a single week. The album has recently received critical acclaim again in 2011, being featured on Triple M Radio's Life-Changing Album series in Australia, with the station playing numerous tracks with commentary. This was the last Guns N' Roses album to feature rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin. It also included the last Guns N' Roses song to feature drummer Steven Adler (Civil War).\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t\t\n1. \t&quot;Civil War&quot;   \t                              7:42\n2. \t&quot;14 Years&quot;   \t\t                      4:23\n3. \t&quot;Yesterdays&quot;    \t                      3:14\n4. \t&quot;Knockin' on Heaven's Door&quot; (Bob Dylan cover) 5:36\n5. \t&quot;Get in the Ring&quot;   \t \t              5:42\n6. \t&quot;Shotgun Blues&quot;   \t\t              3:23\n7. \t&quot;Breakdown&quot;   \t                              7:04\n8. \t&quot;Pretty Tied Up&quot;   \t\t              4:48\n9. \t&quot;Locomotive&quot;    \t                      8:42\n10. \t&quot;So Fine&quot;   \t \t                      4:08\n11. \t&quot;Estranged&quot;   \t \t                      9:23\n12. \t&quot;You Could Be Mine&quot;   \t \t              5:43\n13. \t&quot;Don't Cry&quot; (Alternate lyrics) \t\t      4:45\n14. \t&quot;My World&quot;   \t                              1:24\n\nTotal length:                                         75:58\n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a4c017ca32394c02ed091afacfcc4a19a3ca501","amp;dn":"Guns+N+Roses+-+%281991%29+Use+Your+Illusion+II+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a4c017ca32394c02ed091afacfcc4a19a3ca501","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,76,1,124,163,35,148,192,46,208,145,175,172,252,196,161,154,60,165,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
