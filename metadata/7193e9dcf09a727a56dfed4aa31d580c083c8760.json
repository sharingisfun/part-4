Shu is a big fan of Inori, a singer who has taken the Internet world by storm. However, he also discovers another side of her: she is a member of the Undertakers, a resistance group that aims to liberate Japan from the GHQ. Shu inadvertently gets involved with the Undertaker and the King's Mark appears on his right hand after the Void Genome canister in his pocket broke. This mark bestows him the power to reach inside another person's heart to extract and materialize a weapon or item from it.[2] The anime tells the story of Shu's reluctant involvement with the Undertakers and the hardship involving the battles they fight and the lost truth of Shu's past.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease seed after downloading!\n\nRegards,\nCursator","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7193e9dcf09a727a56dfed4aa31d580c083c8760","amp;dn":"Guilty+Crown+%282012%29+All+Episodes+%28Ep+1-22%29+%2B+2+OVA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7193e9dcf09a727a56dfed4aa31d580c083c8760","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,147,233,220,240,154,114,122,86,223,237,74,163,29,88,12,8,60,135,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
