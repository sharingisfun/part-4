As MATLAB's world-wide sales approach a half-million with an estimated four million users, it becomes a near necessity that professionals and students have a level of competence in its use. Until now, however, there has been no book that quickly and effectively introduces MATLAB's capabilities to new users and assists those with more experience down the path toward increasingly sophisticated work.\nBasics of MATLAB and Beyond is just such a book. Its hands-on, tutorial approach gently takes new users by the hand and leads them to competence in all the fundamentals of MATLAB. Then, with equal effectiveness, it covers the advanced topics that lead to full, creative exploitation of MATLAB's awesome power. With this book, readers will:\nSolve more problems with MATLAB-and solve them faster\nCreate clearer, more beautiful graphics with control over every detail\nCreate their own MATLAB code\nShare their work by exporting data and graphics to other applications\nDevelop graphical user interfaces\nBased on the latest 5.x release, Basics of MATLAB and Beyond supplies both novice and experienced users the tools they need to gain proficiency, increase productivity, and ultimately have more fun with MATLAB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a3fa8737a1aedcd14169fc99226b8ecc849f6a2","amp;dn":"Basics+of+MATLAB%26reg%3B+and+Beyond+-+Andrew+Knight","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a3fa8737a1aedcd14169fc99226b8ecc849f6a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,63,168,115,122,26,237,205,20,22,159,201,146,38,184,236,200,73,246,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
