Being insanely attracted to bad boys has never helped make it easier. \n\nOne look at Tristan, and every brain cell she possessed went up in smoke. This man was trouble with a capital T. It was a given.\nShe knew better. Bad boys were bad. Especially for her. Considering her history, it was crazy to think otherwise. So why did crazy have to feel so damn fine?\n\nFor as long as she could remember, Danika had been focused on the future with single-minded purpose. Tristan came along and taught her everything there was to know about letting go, and living in the present. She fell, hard and deep. Of course, that only made her impact with the ground that much more devastating.\n\nBad Things is about Tristan and Danika, and their train wreck of a love story. This series can be read as a standalone, or with the Up in the Air series.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dff9d4b94a2d9049dd42212daad210d6d4eb408c","amp;dn":"Bad+Things+%28Tristan+%26amp%3B+Danika+%231%29+by+R.K.+Lilley+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dff9d4b94a2d9049dd42212daad210d6d4eb408c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,249,212,185,74,45,144,73,221,66,33,45,170,210,16,214,212,235,64,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
