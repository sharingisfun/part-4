Create and design your own constructions and watch the cars and trucks pass over them - or see them fall and crash while your inferior creations collapse due to weight and the laws of physics!\n\nProgress through numerous levels and build bridges over deep valleys, canals, or rivers. Stress tests reveal whether the bridge you build can withstand the daily stress of continual use from cars and trucks. \n\nChoose between a range of materials for each individual bridge, such as wood, steel, cables, or concrete pillars. Use the appropriate materials and stay within budget to build the perfect bridge. The choice of materials enables you to build each bridge in almost infinite variety - your budget is the only limit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c3577c563a66fd7c6d6bc40548af6d40313ec4c","amp;dn":"Bridge+Constructor+%28PC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c3577c563a66fd7c6d6bc40548af6d40313ec4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,53,119,197,99,166,111,215,198,214,188,64,84,138,246,212,3,19,236,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
