Instead of conveying the speedy tempo of a bustling metropolis, the film instead presents us with a series of meticulously framed shots that at once mimic and subvert the picture-postcard view of our capital city. Yet there is such beauty in KeillerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s images, which blend street signs and bomb sites with whispering park gates and leaves waving in the breeze, that one cannot help but look afresh at a city that has become defamiliarised through the soft-focus lens of Richard CurtisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s camera...&quot;\n\n\nThe film is No 39 in Time Out's 100 Best British Films.\n\nVideo\nResolution\n512 x 384\nAspect ratio\n1.3333\nFormat\nXVID\nBitrate\n1072 kbps\nFrames per second\n25.000\n\nInitial Audio Stream\nFormat\n85\nBitrate\n116 kbps\nRate\n48000 Hz\nChannels\n2\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73c674eac52349d5eae0f6577b88828cbb37754f","amp;dn":"London+%281994%29+dir.+Patrick+Keiller+nar.+by+Paul+Scofield","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73c674eac52349d5eae0f6577b88828cbb37754f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,198,116,234,197,35,73,213,234,224,246,87,123,136,130,140,187,55,117,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
