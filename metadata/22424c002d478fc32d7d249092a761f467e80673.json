Additives perform one or more of the following:\n\n1) Corrosion...sulfuric acid, for example, will corrode the gutter,\n\neaves, and downspout of a home; dumped salt will mar a building\n\nsurface or floor and kill a lawn.\n\n2) Contamination...copper salts will rot rubber products; soap in a\n\npublic or corporate fountain will create giant foam. Or put it in a\n\nsteam boiler if you're more serious about the matter.\n\n3) Abrasion...introduction of light, coarse materials, such as resins,\n\nto automotive fuel, or metal filings placed in the gears of industrial\n\nmachinery, will create frictional havoc.\n\n4) Impurities...adding sugar to gasoline creates harmful carbon\n\nfrom the burning sugar, stopping the engine.\n\nSoaps and detergents make wonderful additions to food and could\n\neven be beneficial if the target happens to be constipated. If not, then soapladen\n\nmunchies or drinks will really keep him moving.\n\nDuring my stay as an invited guest of Uncle Sam I recall some dirty\n\ntricksters' making an action statement against being in KP. They liberally\n\ncoated various pans and cooking vessels with GI soap. They washed mugs\n\nwith a lot of soap, then neglected to rinse them before letting the utensils\n\ndry. Later, when some drinkable potion like milk or coffee was poured into\n\nthe mug by some unsuspecting mark, the soap was activated. Whoosh!\n\nSoap is also a very effective additive to containers in which food is\n\nprepared. The secret is to disguise the taste. Various other additives will do\n\nthat and other tricks.\n________________________________________________\n\nC O N T E N T S\n___________________________________________________\n\nAdditives\n\nCheese Fillers\n\nLawyers\n\nAirlines\n\nChild Abuse\n\nForgery\n\nLicense Plates\n\nAnimals\n\nCIA\n\nGarage Sales\n\nMA Bell\n\nApartments\n\nClassified Ads\n\nGases\n\nMail\n\nAssassination\n\nClergy\n\nGraffiti\n\nMail Drops\n\nAuto Dealers\n\nCoins\n\nHighways\n\nMarriage\n\nBanks\n\nComputers\n\nHookers\n\nMedia\n\nBikers\n\nContractors\n\nHotels\n\nMedical\n\nBooks\n\nCredit Cards\n\nHomes\n\nMilitary\n\nCampuses\n\nDelivery of Consumables\n\nInsurance Companies\n\nMotion Pictures\n\nCarbide\n\nDirty Old Men\n\nIRS\n\nMunicipal Services\n\nCars\n\nDrugs\n\nJoggers\n\nNeighborhoods\n\nCB Radios\n\nEnvironmental\n\nRapists\n\nLaundromats\n\nNotary Seal\n\nCharity\n\nExplosives\n\nLawns\n\nOil Companies\n\nand of all things,\n\nThomas Jefferson\n\nYou will never trust a stranger again, ever!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22424c002d478fc32d7d249092a761f467e80673","amp;dn":"CIA+Book+of+Dirty+Tricks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22424c002d478fc32d7d249092a761f467e80673","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,66,76,0,45,71,143,195,45,125,36,144,146,167,97,244,103,232,6,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
