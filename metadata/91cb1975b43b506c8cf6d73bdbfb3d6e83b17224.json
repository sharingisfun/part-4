Cases are drawn from the following clinical areas: trauma, vascular neurosurgery, tumours, spinal neurosurgery, hydrocephalus and paediatric neurosurgery, functional neurosurgery, and medical problems in neurosurgery. \n\nRevolving around actual patients and the relevant knowledge required in specific situations for decision making in clinical practice (for example, when to operate on a case, when not to operate, balancing risks, which investigations to carry out and in what order), this book will serve as an invaluable educational tool to help trainees, doctors and practising neurosurgeons manage the a wide variety of clinical scenarios encountered in neurosurgery.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91cb1975b43b506c8cf6d73bdbfb3d6e83b17224","amp;dn":"Oxford+Case+Histories+in+Neurosurgery+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91cb1975b43b506c8cf6d73bdbfb3d6e83b17224","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,203,25,117,180,59,80,108,140,246,215,59,219,251,61,110,131,177,114,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
