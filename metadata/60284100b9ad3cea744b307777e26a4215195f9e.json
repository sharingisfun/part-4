A pizza delivery guy unwillingly starts an escort service for wealthy, stylish women. \n\nThis was one of my favorite vhs comedies in the 1980s, but it has not been available on dvd in Europe, so I picked it up when visiting the U.S. recently.\n\n\nRip from new digitally remastered DVD, widescreen, good stereo.\nBurn tested, runs well in my DivX player.\nXviD 720x384, AC3.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60284100b9ad3cea744b307777e26a4215195f9e","amp;dn":"Loverboy+%281989%29+Patrick+Dempsey+%28Opt.SpanSubs%29+Remastered","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60284100b9ad3cea744b307777e26a4215195f9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,40,65,0,185,173,60,234,116,75,48,119,119,226,106,66,21,25,95,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
