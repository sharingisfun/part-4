Next he formed Ronnie Dio and The Prophets in the Autumn of 1961; the band lasted until 1967. After this Dio formed The Electric Elves (1967-1969) who changed their name first to The Elves (1969-1970), and finally the more well known Elf (1970-1975).\nDue to Elf's association with Deep Purple Dio was invited to sing for a Ritchie Blackmore solo project that went on to become Rainbow, who he sang for from 1975 to 1978. After leaving Rainbow he replaced Ozzy Osbourne in Black Sabbath, recording two studio albums between 1979 and 1982 before leaving under acrymonous circumstances.\n\nDio took drummer Vinny Appice with him from Sabbath to form his own, eponymous band Dio, which started in 1983.\n\nDio was put on hold in the early 90s when Ronnie rejoined Black Sabbath, and was reactivated with a new line-up after he quit the band (again under stormy circumstances) after only one album.\n\nRonnie James Dio is generally credited as the originator of the famous mano cornuta ( or &quot;devil horns&quot; ) symbol in the metal world. According to him, his grandmother used to make the symbol as a signal to ward off evil. Dio started using the gesture onstage in the early days of his career.\nScott Warren was part of the Dio line-up from 1993 to the end of the band in 2010, but mostly was only called upon to perform live, with Ronnie or his writing partner (whomever it was at the time) performing the keyboard parts in the studio.\n\nIn 2003, Ronnie accidentally cut off his thumb in a bizarre gardening accident. It was later sewn back on and became fully functional again.\nRoger Glover, the bass player of Deep Purple, had, as a solo artist, a world wide hit in 1974, &quot;Love is All&quot;. It had, for those days, a very special video-clip, with a frog. It was Ronnie James Dio who did the vocals for that song.\n\nDio rejoined his Black Sabbath band-mates again in 2007, this time under the name Heaven and Hell. They released one album in 2009, which would the final record of his long career.\n\nRonnie James Dio died in a hospital in Texas on May 16th, 2010 after battling a stomach cancer, thus the Dio band was no more.\n\nThe remaining four members of the band, along with vocalists Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens and Toby Jepson, have continued to tour in tribute as Dio Disciples. James LoMenzo and Doro Pesch have filled in for Rudy Sarzo and Owens, respectively.\n\nLast Known Line-Up:\n\nRonnie James Dio - Vocals, Keyboards\nCraig Goldy - Guitars\nSimon Wright - Drums\nScott Warren - Keyboards\nRudy Sarzo - Bass\n\nTracklist 2000\n01.
