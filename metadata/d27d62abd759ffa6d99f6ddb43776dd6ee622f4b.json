But despite succulent re-issues from labels like Astralwerks and Light in the Attic, the resurgence of seasoned soul sisters like Bettye LaVette, and the volcanic popularity of new-soul crooners like Amy Winehouse, the champions of the new generation\\&amp;#039;s purist strain are Sharon Jones &amp; the Dap Kings. After the often upbeat, always exciting sounds of 2005\\&amp;#039;s Naturally, the band\\&amp;#039;s next outing comes off as a slightly more tempered affair. The title track opens with an indefatigable statement of purpose, dropping into a late-stage, sub-halftime groove so Jones can fully \\&quot;take [her] time\\&quot; lamenting her missing man. Elsewhere, her voice effortless treads the heights and depths of its range with timeless aplomb (\\&quot;Be Easy,\\&quot; \\&quot;When the Other Foot Drops, Uncle,\\&quot; \\&quot;Answer Me\\&quot;). The Dap Kings themselves have reached a pocket-digging near-perfection, recent collaborations with Kanye West, Lily Allen, and the aforementioned Winehouse, yielding the sounds of a band at the top of its game. At times, these tracks court the uninspired flavor of the wholly derivative, but in all, 100 Days, 100 Nights makes for a very welcome addition to any avid listener\\&amp;#039;s contemporary soul music library. --Jason Kirk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d27d62abd759ffa6d99f6ddb43776dd6ee622f4b","amp;dn":"Sharon+Jones+%26+The+Dap-Kings+-+%5B2007%5D+100+Days%2C+100+Nights","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d27d62abd759ffa6d99f6ddb43776dd6ee622f4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,125,98,171,215,89,255,166,217,159,109,219,67,119,109,214,238,98,47,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
