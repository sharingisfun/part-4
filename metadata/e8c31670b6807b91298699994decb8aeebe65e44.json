There are many and varied coat types and there is a vast difference between the time it takes to groom a Doberman and an Old English Sheepdog, a Siamese and a Persian cat. This book provides much needed guidance for groomers, breeders and owners. It will be invaluable for those taking the City and Guilds 775 Grooming exam and animal care students of all levels. Step by step grooming/clipping techniques are described for the more popular breeds of dog and cat and in each case the technique is illustrated with photographic sequences. The book also includes allied subjects such as skin care, commonly found skin parasites and basic first aid and handling.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8c31670b6807b91298699994decb8aeebe65e44","amp;dn":"Grooming+Manual+for+Dog+and+Cat+%5Btahir99%5D+VRG.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8c31670b6807b91298699994decb8aeebe65e44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,195,22,112,182,128,123,145,41,134,153,153,77,236,184,174,235,230,94,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
