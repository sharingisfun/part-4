This release is considered by critics to be a classic of the genre.\n\nTheir music is widely characterized as cosmic and atmospheric. The early albums were more psychedelic-oriented and all had one lengthy track per side: one more powerful and dramatic, the other of a more atmospheric nature.\n  \nAsh Ra Tempel's monster debut album stands as being both astonishingly prescient and just flat out good, a logical extension of the space-jam-freakout ethos into rarified realms. Featuring the original trio of Enke, Gottsching and Schulze, Ash Ra Tempel consists of only two side-long tracks, both of which are gripping examples of technical ability mixed with rock power. \n\n\n\nStraight, no chaser.\n:)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66bde3ad6d3170e5f7abe5cc24edd57a8b998292","amp;dn":"Ash+Ra+Tempel+-+Ash+Ra+Tempel+%281st+Album%29+%2F+1971","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66bde3ad6d3170e5f7abe5cc24edd57a8b998292","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,189,227,173,109,49,112,229,247,171,229,204,36,237,213,122,139,153,130,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
