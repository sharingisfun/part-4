For animals there is just one goal in life--to continue their bloodline in the form of offspring. They are an animal's legacy for the future. The story of their journey is about hope, facing danger, actions of breath-taking boldness, extraordinary behaviours and, ultimately, success against the odds. \n\nThis spectacular series follows that journey through its six crucial stages: taking their first steps in the world, growing up, finding a home, gaining power, winning a mate and succeeding as a parent. Life Story brings a new level of story-telling to the landmark genre, creating an experience that is both intimate and intense. We follow the struggles and triumphs of individual animals, drawing the viewer into their worlds, to sense the danger, the challenges and the decisions they must face.\n\n\n\nPart 4: Power\n\nAnimals must try to gain a position of power in their worlds. The most powerful have best access to food and water, and they are also the most attractive to the opposite sex.\nAn orphaned, friendless, young chimp leaves his playful youth behind as he attempts to climb the social ladder. His troop is ruled by big, aggressive males. His first attempt to join them ends in a beating, but making his first friend changes his life. Together, they hunt for small mammals using spears, and share the spoils. It's an act that changes them from friends to allies.\nIn meerkat society knowledge is power, and knowing how to deal with a venomous snake is essential for any youngster who wants to be a player in its world. \nFew young, male kangaroos will ever get to occupy the top spot in their world. The only way is to fight and beat the 8-foot ruling male in a brutal boxing match.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p026vg04&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p026vg04&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTechnical Specs \n\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;f2ba9b959ab2bec6dcc3&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo Bitrate: 3035 Kbps \nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\nVideo Resolution: 1280 x 720\nAudio Codec: AAC LC\nAudio English \nAudio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\nAudio Channels: Stereo 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber of Parts: 6\nContainer Mp4\nPart Size: 1.31 GB\nSource: HDrip\nEncoded by: Harry65 \n\nRelease Notes\nMerged Subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dff40a7a82e9ced79d77300c384a1f3b8006a018","amp;dn":"BBC.Life.Story.4of6.Power.720p.HDrip.x264.AAC..mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dff40a7a82e9ced79d77300c384a1f3b8006a018","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,244,10,122,130,233,206,215,157,119,48,12,56,74,31,59,128,6,160,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
