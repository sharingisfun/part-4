Cover your entire roof with solar cells, collect the free energy from the sun! Just think, Since you can screen print these cells, size is no limit. Think about it, a 24&quot; homemade cell that could be powerful enough to run a 12 volt dc x 4 amp motor using only one cell! Solar cell screen printing has been around for about 10 years or so and there are many manufactures already doing it here in the USA and abroad. There are many different types of chemical printing inks to use and many different screen printing techniques to apply it with. But the best I have seen so far was invented by Japan, They have a very simple technique of vibrating the ink after it is printed to get the air bubbles out of the wet ink before it dries. This causes the efficiency of the solar cells to sky rocket! An ink vibrator is very simple to build using a of qty 2 18&quot; x 18&quot; x 3/4&quot; plywood and a few push springs from your local hardware store and a small dc or ac motor with an off balance on the shaft which you can buy or make yourself. Japan now has a US patent, The patent claims that they can be just as powerful as our American made silicon solar cells!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65146015bd3255a736a44f14e7b9350c5a13e698","amp;dn":"Homemade+Solar+Cell+Plans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65146015bd3255a736a44f14e7b9350c5a13e698","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,20,96,21,189,50,85,167,54,164,79,20,231,185,53,12,90,19,230,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
