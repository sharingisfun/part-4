And it is the issue of time standing still that is creating upheaval in the Pucillo family.\n\nErnesto is 70 years old; he hates change and doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want his fishing boat to be scrapped.\nHis grandson Filippo, whose father was lost at sea, is 20 years old and juggles his existence between his grandfather ErnestoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s timeless subsistence and his uncle NinoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s way of life, in which catching fish has been replaced by catering to tourists.\n\nHis young, widowed mother, Giulietta, believes that the islandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unchanging lifestyle has turned them all into outsiders and that neither she nor Filippo stand a chance of forging a different future.\n\nThe hope of doing something different with their lives means finding the courage to leave.\nOne day the sea carries other voyagers into their lives: among them Sara and her son, who have escaped violent oppression in North Africa.\n\nErnesto, firmly entrenched in the traditional laws of the sea, is very welcoming to all who have traveled over water. However, manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s laws seem to have changed and favour an entirely different approach to dealing with illegal immigrants. This dilemma creates a great deal of turmoil in the Pucillo family, especially between Giulietta and Sara, and the PucilloÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s have no choice but to reexamine their way of life.\n\n\nThis film was chosen by Italy to represent the country in the Oscar 2012.
