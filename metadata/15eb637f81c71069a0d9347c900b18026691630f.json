In particular, simulation and modelling tools have enabled engineers to analyse and understand the behaviour of selected processes prior to building actual plants. \r\n\r\nThe aim of design or retrofit of chemical processes is to produce profitably products that satisfy the societal needs, ensuring safe and reliable operation of each process, as well as minimising any effects on the environment. This involves the conceptual design or retrofit of plants and processes, novel manufacturing approaches, process/control system design interactions and operability, manufacturability, environmental and safety issues. \r\n\r\nBacked by current studies, this 2-volume set gives a comprehensive survey of the various approaches and latest developments on the use of CAPE in the process industry.\r\n\r\nAn invaluable reference to the scientific and industrial community in the field of computer aided process and product engineering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15eb637f81c71069a0d9347c900b18026691630f","amp;dn":"Computer+Aided+Process+and+Product+Engineering+%28CAPE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15eb637f81c71069a0d9347c900b18026691630f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,235,99,127,129,199,16,105,160,217,52,124,144,11,24,2,102,145,99,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
