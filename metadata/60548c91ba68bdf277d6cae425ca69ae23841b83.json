FaurÃƒÂ©Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s serene and consoling Requiem is the centerpiece of the album, which also features three further classics, and the world-premiere recording of a neglected rarity, by the same composer.\n\nThe Requiem features two vocal soloists, usually a soprano and a baritone. Here, however, a countertenor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ exclusive Virgin Classics artist and one of EuropeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best-selling classical artists, Philippe Jaroussky Ã¢â‚¬â€œ brings his ethereal timbre and sensitive phrasing to the poised Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pie Jesu.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ His baritone colleague is the warm-toned German Matthias Goerne, acknowledged as one of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finest vocal recitalists. The Choeur de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Orchestre de Paris also performs in three other works on the CD, including the exquisite Pavane, with its flowing melody and mock-Rococo verses, and two early settings of religious texts: the touching Cantique de Jean Racine and Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in its world-premiere recording Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Super Flumina Babylonis (By the Rivers of Babylon). Completing the program is the reflective but impassioned ElÃƒÂ©gie for cello and orchestra, performed by the Orchestre de ParisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Principal Cellist, Eric Picard.\n\nLondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Independent recently praised the new album:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Paavo JÃƒÂ¤rviÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recent recordings of BeethovenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ninth Symphony and BrahmsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ein deutsches Requiem have demonstrated his ability to marshal grand forces Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the latter comparison is most pertinent here, in another beautifully-balanced Requiem of shorter, gentler, Gallic persuasion.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assisted here by equally sensitive contributions from baritone Matthias Goerne in the Ã¢â‚¬ËœOffertoriumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœLibera MeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ sections, and countertenor Philippe Jaroussky, breathtakingly angelic in what Saint-SaÃƒÂ«ns considered the only Ã¢â‚¬ËœPie JesuÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ worth performing. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s JÃƒÂ¤rviÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s uncanny knack to somehow derive spiritual uplift from the gloomiest of subjects that most impresses here, a talent tailored to fit such needs.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nBBC Review\nA beautifully warm, full sound which colours both timbre and interpretation.\nCharlotte Gardner 2011-10-26\n\n1 Requiem Op. 48: I.
