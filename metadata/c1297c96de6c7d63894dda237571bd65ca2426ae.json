So yeah Im posting this cause Live Bullet was a couple of years before I picked up on the Bullet but believe it a wore out more than a few pieces of that vinyl and CD's as well, But when this came out I was ready for it It was My theme album my standby It was the one I could play anywhere I went and whatever I was doing and everybody was into it So I still aint sayin anything got outdone but for a second time perfection was approached. Whew! To much talkin for me....Nine Tonight get and relive the good and the real from the only one who could do this  ...Twice.....
