Lost (February 2006): Detective Inspector Vincent Ruiz canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t remember how he got to the hospital. He was found floating in the Thames with a gunshot wound in his leg and a picture of missing child Mickey Carlyle in his pocket. But MickeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s killer is already in jail. Add to this the blood stained boat found near where Ruiz was pulled from the water, and the pieces just donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t add up.\n\nNow, accused of faking amnesia and under investigation, Ruiz reaches out to psychologist Joseph OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Loughlin to help him unlock his memory, clear his name, and solve this ominous puzzle.\n\nMichael Robotham is one of the finest new thriller writers working today. Marked by vivid characters and full of unexpected turns, Lost is a hair-raising journey of vengeance, grief, and redemption through the dark London underworld.\n\n&quot;... a thoughtful and subtle thriller, with convincing, three-dimensional characters.&quot; --Publishers Weekly\n\n03. Shatter (aka The Sleep of Reason) (August 2008): Joe O'Loughlin is in familiar territory - standing on a bridge high above a flooded gorge, trying to stop a distraught woman from jumping. &quot;You don't understand,&quot; she whispers, and lets go. Joe is haunted by his failure to save the woman, until her teenage daughter finds him and reveals that her mother would never have committed suicide - not like that. She was terrified of heights.\n\nWhat could have driven her to commit such a desperate act? Whose voice? What evil?\n\nHaving devoted his career to repairing damaged minds, Joe must now confront an adversary who tears them apart. With pitch-perfect dialogue, believable characters, and astonishingly unpredictable plot twists, Shatter is guaranteed to keep even the most avid thriller readers riveted long into the night.\n\n&quot;Terrific....a classic 'wrong man' thriller that puts its hero in hot water, then raises the Fahrenheit to a fever pitch. Robotham not only builds the suspense masterfully but tops it off with a stunning twist.&quot; --People\n\n04. Bleed for Me (June 2010): She's standing at the front door. Covered in blood. Is she the victim of a crime? Or the perpetrator?\n\nWhen Sienna Hegarty, a troubled friend of his daughter, comes to Joe O'Loughlin's door terrorized, incoherent, and covered in blood, he vows to unearth the dark secrets her mind has buried. The police find a major piece of the puzzle at Sienna's house: her father, a retired cop, murdered.\n\nTests confirm that it's Mr. Herharty's blood on Sienna. She says she remembers nothing. Investigators take aim at Sienna. O'Loughlin senses something different is happening, something subterranean and terrifying to Sienna. It may be something in her mind. Or it may be something real. Someone real. Someone capable of the most grim and gruesome murder, and willing to kill again if anyone gets too close.\n\n05. Say You're Sorry (October 2012): TWO MISSING GIRLS. TWO BRUTAL MURDERS. ALL CONNECTED TO ONE FARM HOUSE. WHO IS TO BLAME?\n\nWhen pretty and popular teenagers Piper Hadley and Tash McBain disappear one Sunday morning, the investigation captivates a nation but the girls are never found.\n\nThree years later, during the worst blizzard in a century, a husband and wife are brutally killed in the farmhouse where Tash McBain once lived. A suspect is in custody, a troubled young man who can hear voices and claims that he saw a girl that night being chased by a snowman.\n\nConvinced that Piper or Tash might still be alive, clinical psychologist Joe O'Loughlin and ex-cop Vincent Ruiz, persuade the police to re-open the investigation. But they are racing against time to save the girls from someone with an evil, calculating and twisted mind...\n\n&quot;...lives up to the hype of being unputdownable.&quot; --Sunday Telegraph\n\n06. Watching You (August 2013): Before I Go to Sleep meets When a Stranger Calls in Michael Robotham's taut and nuanced new thriller.\n\nMarnie Logan often feels like she's being watched: a warm breath on the back of her neck, or a shadow in the corner of her eye that vanishes when she turns her head.\n\nNow her life is frozen. Her husband Daniel is missing. She can't access his bank accounts or his life insurance. Depressed and increasingly desperate, she seeks the help of clinical psychologist Joe O'Loughlin. \n\nO'Loughlin discovers Daniel's Big Red Book--a collage of pictures, interviews, and anecdotes. The book, which Daniel intended as a surprise birthday gift, now leads to a shocking discovery. Any person who has ever crossed Marnie has paid an exacting price. And O'Loughlin may be next in line.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2bb0e8f76be5d907b2496a964567967e38f80a3","amp;dn":"Joe+O%27Loughlin+series+by+Michael+Robotham","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2bb0e8f76be5d907b2496a964567967e38f80a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,187,14,143,118,190,93,144,123,36,150,169,100,86,121,103,227,143,128,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
