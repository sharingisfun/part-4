Feel free to relabel the names of the comics themselves as you see fit. \n\nThis is pretty much Deadpool all by his lonesome, doing his assassin thing. all sorts of hilarity ensues - as it frequently does when the Merc with the Mouth is involved. This title is written by Daniel Way with tons of great artists, and has some crossover with major Marvel events like Dark Reign. There are also two special issues, 900 and 1000, that are independent of continuity but could be considered part of this run. I have not included them as they are not available digitally yet and are not necessary. For similar reasons, the 49.1 issue is included but the (I believe) single Annual is not. Thanks to JK-Empire for these digital copies - please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6810de9164fa0c5d2d9e85e4849e81b7509867a0","amp;dn":"Deadpool+v2+01-63+%282008-2012%2C+Dgtl%2C+JK-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6810de9164fa0c5d2d9e85e4849e81b7509867a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,16,222,145,100,250,12,93,45,158,133,228,132,158,129,183,80,152,103,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
