She has told so many lies about where she comes from and who she is that the truth is like a cloudy nightmare she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite recall. About to graduate from college and with her trust fund almost tapped out, she takes a job babysitting a troubled boy named Luke. Expelled from schools all over the country, the manipulative young Luke is accustomed to controlÃ‚Â­ling the people in his life. But, in Lana, he may have met his match. Or has Lana met hers? \n\nWhen LanaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s closest friend, Beck, mysteriously disappears, Lana resumes her lying waysÃ¢â‚¬â€to friends, to the police, to herself. The police have a lot of questions for Lana when the story about her whereÃ‚Â­abouts the night Beck disappeared doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t jibe with eyewitness accounts. Lana will do anything to hide the truth, but it might not be enough to keep her ominous secrets buried: someone else knows about LanaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lies. And heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dying to tell. \n\nLisa UngerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writing has been hailed as Ã¢â‚¬Å“sensaÃ‚Â­tionalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Publishers Weekly) and Ã¢â‚¬Å“sophisticatedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (New York Daily News), with Ã¢â‚¬Å“gripping narrative and evocative, muscular proseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Associated Press). Masterfully suspenseful, finely crafted, and written with a no-holds-barred raw power, In the Blood is Unger at her best.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre Reader ready.
