Storyboarding allows you to skip chunks of code by just dragging scenes and segues onto your Storyboard canvas. A time saver for sure, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new!\n\nWhat youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn\n- How iOS Storyboarding is like a different planet in the Xcode universe. We do this by introducing you to the standard transitions to views, passing data to the views, returning data from the views, and, lastly, showing how to navigate the critical transitions to views.\n\n- How to develop a simple utility app using Storyboarding. Here we learn the foundation of many apps, which is how to place controls on the settings screen of a utility application and to return those settings to the main view of the app via the settings view delegate protocol.\n\nWho this book is for\nThis book is for the beginner who has never programmed, but can use the Storyboarding tool in Xcode to get up and running fast. This book is also for experienced iOS developers who wish to learn Storyboarding to quickly cut down on their app development and debugging time.\n\nTable of Contents\n- Preliminaries\n- Fundamentals\n- Storyboarding with MapView\n- Building a Utility Application\n- Storyboarding a Page-Based App\n- Mastering Table Views with Storyboarding: Core Data Setup\n- Mastering Table Views with Storyboarding: Designing the Flow\n- Mastering Table Views with Storyboarding: Coding the Backend\n- Single View #3: wanderBoard Part I\n- Single View #3: wanderBoard Part II\n- Single View #3: wanderBoard Part III\n- How Far You Have Come\n\nBook Details\nPaperback: 644 pages\nPublisher: Apress (October 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1430242728\nISBN-13: 978-1430242727","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e45898e16ec9d56641a2c502ff7adb908b522705","amp;dn":"Beginning+iOS+Storyboarding+Using+XCode+V413HAV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e45898e16ec9d56641a2c502ff7adb908b522705","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,88,152,225,110,201,213,102,65,162,197,2,255,122,219,144,139,82,39,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
