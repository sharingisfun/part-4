The remainder of the album is spotty but the material is never less than stellar, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDo Bad On My Own,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEyez On da PrizeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCome Back Wit ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ confirm Z-ROÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reputation as one of the few true heavyweights of this era.\n\n  _____      ____    U  ___ u            _       _  __      _             \n |&quot;_  /u  U |  _&quot;\\ u  \\/&quot;_ \\/        U  /&quot;\\  u  |&quot;|/ /  U  /&quot;\\  u         \n U / //U  u\\| |_) |/  | | | |         \\/ _ \\/   | ' /    \\/ _ \\/          \n \\/ /_ /___\\|  _ &lt;.-,_| |_| |         / ___ \\ U/| . \\\\u  / ___ \\          \n /____|__&quot;__|_| \\_\\\\_)-\\___/         /_/   \\_\\  |_|\\_\\  /_/   \\_\\         \n _//&lt;&lt;,-    //   \\\\_    \\\\            \\\\    &gt;&gt;,-,&gt;&gt; \\\\,-.\\\\    &gt;&gt;         \n(__) (_/   (__)  (__)  (__)          (__)  (__)\\.)
