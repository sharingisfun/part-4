Falling in love with him was the easiest thing Iâ€™ve ever done. It happened instantly. Completely. Irrevocably.\r\n\r\nMarrying him was a dream come true. Staying married to him is the fight of my life. Love transforms. Ours is both a refuge from the storm and the most violent of tempests. Two damaged souls entwined as one.\r\n\r\nWe have bared our deepest, ugliest secrets to one another. Gideon is the mirror that reflects all my flaws â€¦ and all the beauty I couldnâ€™t see. He has given me everything. Now, I must prove I can be the rock, the shelter for him that he is for me. Together, we could stand against those who work so viciously to come between us.\r\n\r\nBut our greatest battle may lie within the very vows that give us strength. Committing to love was only the beginning. Fighting for it will either set us free ... or break us apart","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf35b8dcdbbd38b8a50971cbbcf8555e08198daa","amp;dn":"One+with+You%3A+A+Crossfire+Novel+%28Crossfire+Series+Book+5%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf35b8dcdbbd38b8a50971cbbcf8555e08198daa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,53,184,220,219,189,56,184,165,9,113,203,188,248,85,94,8,25,141,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
