Stella's boorish husband, Stanley Kowalski (Marlon Brando), not only regards Blanche's aristocratic affectations as a royal pain but also thinks she's holding out on inheritance money that rightfully belongs to Stella. On the fringes of sanity, Blanche is trying to forget her checkered past and start life anew. Attracted to Stanley's friend Mitch (Karl Malden), she glosses over the less savory incidents in her past, but she soon discovers that she cannot outrun that past, and the stage is set for her final, brutal confrontation with her brother-in-law. Brando, Hunter, and Malden had all starred in the original Broadway version of Streetcar, although the original Blanche had been Jessica Tandy. Brando lost out to Humphrey Bogart for the 1951 Best Actor Oscar, but Leigh, Hunter, and Malden all won Oscars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Vivien Leigh, Marlon Brando, Kim Hunter, Karl Malden\r\nDIRECTOR......: Elia Kazan\r\nWRITERS.......: Tennessee Williams, Oscar Saul\r\nGENRE.........: Drama\r\nRATING........: 8.0/10  78,738 votes\r\nIMDB link.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044081\r\nRUNTIME.......: 2h 04mn\r\nSIZE..........: 3.79 GiB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264 (  )\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1480x1080\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 1.37:1\r\nBITRATE.......: 4000 Kbps\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO1........: English E-AC3 Mono 256 Kbps\r\nAUDIO2........: Commentary with Karl Malden and film historian Rudy Behlmer\r\nSUBTITLES.....: CZE, DAN, DUT, ENG, FIN, FRE, GER, ITA, NOR, PER, POR, SPA, SWE  \r\nSOURCE........: Blu Ray Remux\r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2016-09-03","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:117c60cde3b576ad23ae45732d5dd3a538c504f7","amp;dn":"A.Streetcar.Named.Desire.1951.1080p.BluRay.x264.EAC3-SARTRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"117c60cde3b576ad23ae45732d5dd3a538c504f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,124,96,205,227,181,118,173,35,174,69,115,45,93,211,165,56,197,4,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
