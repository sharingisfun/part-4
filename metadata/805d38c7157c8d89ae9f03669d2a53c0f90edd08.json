For two explosive seasons, CRIME STORY told the hard-boiled saga of hair-trigger cop Lieutenant Mike Torello [Dennis Farina] and his obsessive pursuit of ruthless gangster Ray Luca [Anthony Denison] from the mean streets of early ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢60s Chicago to the neon nights of mob-run Las Vegas. Today, CRIME STORY is considered a true cult classic as well as one of the most startling series in television history. THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON features a stellar supporting cast that includes Stephen Lang, Bill Campbell, Ted Levine, Darlanne Fluegel and Joseph Wiseman, and such guest stars as David Caruso, Michael Madsen, Pam Grier, Ving Rhames, Lorraine Bracco, Gary Sinise, Deborah Harry, Vincent Gallo and Julia Roberts. \n\n               Original\n Episode #     Air Date   Titles\n_____ ______  __________  ___________________________________________\n1      1-01   18/Sep/86   Pilot (1)\n2      1-02   18/Sep/86   Pilot (2)\n3      1-03   19/Sep/86   Final Transmission\n4      1-04   26/Sep/86   Shadow Dancer\n5      1-05   30/Sep/86   The Saint Louis Book of Blues\n6      1-06   07/Oct/86   The War\n7      1-07   14/Oct/86   Abrams for the Defense\n8      1-08   28/Oct/86   Pursuit of a Wanted Felon\n9      1-09   04/Nov/86   Old Friends, Dead Ends\n10     1-10   11/Nov/86   Justice Hits the Skids\n11     1-11   05/Dec/86   For Love or Money\n12     1-13   05/Dec/86   Crime Pays\n12     1-12   12/Dec/86   Hide and Go Thief\n13     1-14   26/Dec/86   Strange Bedfellows\n14     1-15   09/Jan/87   Fatal Crossroads (aka Fortune in Men's Eyes)\n15     1-16   16/Jan/87   Torello on Trial\n16     1-17   30/Jan/87   The Kingdom of Money\n17     1-18   06/Feb/87   The Battle of Las Vegas\n18     1-19   13/Feb/87   The Survivor\n19     1-20   27/Feb/87   The Pinnacle\n20     1-21   06/Mar/87   Top of the World (aka The King in a Cage)\n21     1-22   13/Mar/87   Ground Zero\n\n\nFind Season 2 here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5363358","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:805d38c7157c8d89ae9f03669d2a53c0f90edd08","amp;dn":"Crime+Story%2C+Season+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"805d38c7157c8d89ae9f03669d2a53c0f90edd08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,93,56,199,21,124,141,137,174,159,3,102,157,42,83,192,249,14,221,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
