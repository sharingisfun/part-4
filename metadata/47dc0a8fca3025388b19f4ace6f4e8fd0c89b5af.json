Bathed in pale Spring sunlight, the small fishing port of Illsmouth is a sleepy New England town where time seems to stand still. Appearances can be very deceiving, however .... Beneath the peaceful tranquility of this small village, a horrifying truth lingers.\nWhispers in a dusty, secluded library ripple with fear as questions of the past are brought into the present. Is there a link between the return of Halley's comet and the resurgence of the Great Ancients who once dominated the land in a reign of terror? Legend tells tales of an ancient ritual ground, hidden deep in the shadows of the tangled forest, marked by an ornate and mysterious cross. Once, long ago, this site was the stage for wild and terrifying rites that no one dare speak of, lest they suffer the wrath of the Ancients.\nWhy are the townspeople of Illsmouth struck by such shattering terror? Why are they drawn to the ancient ritual grounds after so many years? What has released this curse from its deep sleep to play havoc upon the souls of innocent people?\nYou'll take on the role of John T. Carter, a brilliant young astronomer, piecing together the puzzling history of the village and its cryptic inhabitants. Incredibly realistic action and supernatural chaos intertwine to draw players deep into the puzzling mysteries within the Shadow of the Comet.\nIncludes the CD-ROM and floppy versions of Call of Cthulhu: Shadow of the Comet.\nBone chilling sound effects that hurtle you into the depths of chaos!\nConfront your deepest fears as you enter once more the realm of Lovecraftian horror!\n\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: Windows XP/Vista/7/8 \nProcessor: 2.0 GHz, Memory: 1 GB RAM, Graphics: 256 MB VRAM compatible with DirectX 9.0c\nMouse, Keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47dc0a8fca3025388b19f4ace6f4e8fd0c89b5af","amp;dn":"Call+Of+Cthulhu%3A+Shadow+Of+The+Comet+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47dc0a8fca3025388b19f4ace6f4e8fd0c89b5af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,220,10,143,202,48,37,56,139,25,244,172,230,244,232,253,12,137,181,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
