Lang's music is notable for both his unusual voice, which has been compared to that of a 40-year-old blues veteran, and for his guitar solos. His solo patterns have especially been noted for his frequent use of wide vibratos.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLong Time Coming is the 4th album by Jonny Lang, recorded at MF Studio and The Attic, Monrovia, California, and released on October 14, 2003, when he was 22. This fourth album from the still relatively young Lang had been a &quot;long time coming&quot;, with five years passing since the release of Wander This World.\n\nLang incorporated more R&amp;B influences into his overall musical style, without neglecting his love for the blues. The album has more rock-elements compared to his previous work, and features one ballad with beat and arrangement comparable to modern R&amp;B/Pop (&quot;Touch&quot;). One of the songs is a cover of Edgar Winter's &quot;Dying to Live&quot;. The album also features Aerosmith's Steven Tyler on &quot;Happiness and Misery,&quot; where he plays the harmonica.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJonny Lang (vocals, lead guitar)\nMarti Frederiksen (rhythm guitar, bass, drums, percussion)\nJohn Goux (guitar)\nJim Cox (piano, Wurlitzer piano, Hammond B-3 organ)\nScott Gordon (Wurlitzer piano, programming)\nBruce McCabe (clavinet)\nJoey Waronker (drums)\nLenny Castro (congas)\nKayla Parker (background vocals)\nSteven Tyler &amp; Anthony Hamilton (guests)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d28d3d8c51e9d55de4741fe983a83b9205a2b8ad","amp;dn":"Jonny+Lang+-+Long+Time+Coming+%5B2003%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d28d3d8c51e9d55de4741fe983a83b9205a2b8ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,141,61,140,81,233,213,93,228,116,31,233,131,168,59,146,5,162,184,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
