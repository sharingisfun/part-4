Odd. is the second studio album by rock band Panic at the Disco, released on the record label Fueled by Ramen. The first single from the album is &quot;Nine in the Afternoon&quot;. The second single is &quot;Mad as Rabbits&quot; (released as a digital single on iTunes), and the new third single is &quot;That Green Gentleman (Things Have Changed)&quot;. The upcoming fourth single is hinted to be &quot;Northern Downpour&quot;, although, many radio stations have been playing &quot;Pas De Cheval&quot;, and calling it the fourth single.\n\nThis album is different from their debut album, A Fever You Can&amp;#039;t Sweat Out, as many songs have the titles as lyrics. In A Fever You Can&amp;#039;t Sweat Out, the majority of the titles of songs were from books and movies. The album also features songs where Brendon Urie and Ryan Ross both contribute the lead vocal roles, as well as a more mature and lighter musical and lyrical style.\n\nIt has already sold over 500,000 copies worldwide. On the album, the band has seemingly abandoned their original sound found in A Fever You Can&amp;#039;t Sweat Out permanently, opting for a far happier and more mature sound. According to Ryan Ross, the band is already planning their third studio album as a follow up to Pretty Odd...\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;We&amp;#039;re So Starving&quot; - 1:21\n   2. &quot;Nine in the Afternoon&quot; - 3:11\n   3. &quot;She&amp;#039;s a Handsome Woman&quot; - 3:12\n   4. &quot;Do You Know What I&amp;#039;m Seeing?&quot; - 4:14\n   5. &quot;That Green Gentleman (Things Have Changed)&quot; - 3:15\n   6. &quot;I Have Friends in Holy Spaces&quot; - 1:56\n   7. &quot;Northern Downpour&quot; - 4:07\n   8. &quot;When the Day Met the Night&quot; - 4:53\n   9. &quot;Pas de Cheval&quot; - 2:39\n  10. &quot;The Piano Knows Something I Don&amp;#039;t Know&quot; - 3:43\n  11. &quot;Behind the Sea&quot; - 3:33\n  12. &quot;Folkin&amp;#039; Around&quot; - 1:55\n  13. &quot;She Had the World&quot; - 3:47\n  14. &quot;From a Mountain in the Middle of the Cabins&quot; - 3:02\n  15. &quot;Mad as Rabbits&quot; - 3:43\n\n\nAlso bundled with this torrent is the Nine in the afternoon Video. :-)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9310f07a02c1b80a10d5c2867b293f37fd43361e","amp;dn":"Panic+At+The+Disco+-+Pretty+Odd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9310f07a02c1b80a10d5c2867b293f37fd43361e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,16,240,122,2,193,184,10,16,213,194,134,123,41,63,55,253,67,54,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
