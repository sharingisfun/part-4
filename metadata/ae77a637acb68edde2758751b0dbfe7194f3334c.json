The DVDs\ndid not contain any extras.\n\nAmerica's Energon has 51 episodes, while Japan's Transformers: Superlink has 52\nepisodes.  For unknown reason's, Superlink's episode 33, Return! Our Scorponok, was\nnever dubbed into English and broadcast in America.  This release acknowledges the\nomission by keeping the original episode numbering, and leaving a gap at the\nmissing 33rd episode.\n\nThe removal of the episode leaves Energon with a couple of pronounced holes in its\nongoing story, as plots already in motion are expanded on and important events\noccur which influence future episodes.
