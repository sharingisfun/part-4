This version was created for 5th edition, but was created with the then unreleased 6th edition rules in mind. Check out the 6th edition core rulebook for ret-con rules that make these new Necrons work with the latest rules.\n\nThis Codex was written by Matt Ward (sigh) so make sure to check out the FAQ and Errata for the fixes to his massive balance misinterpretation issues.\n\nAlso, this version is a picture pdf, not a searchable text. Sorry, but that's the best anyone's got that I've found. Bookmarks are stupidly per-page, so no love there either. Again, sorry.\n\nAs always, please seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff95d9a0f1e5569c0f07458cd0ff477dcc2cdfda","amp;dn":"Warhammer+40K+Necrons+Codex+%285th%2F6th+Edition+2011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff95d9a0f1e5569c0f07458cd0ff477dcc2cdfda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,149,217,160,241,229,86,156,15,7,69,140,208,255,71,125,204,44,223,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
