At the same time, the book offers a cautionary evaluation of the future financing of innovation in terms of what's gone wrong and how to succeed in the future.Martin Austin explores the challenge that the pharmaceutical (and related) industries face in terms of balancing short term, cost containment and expenditure control in areas such as internal research and development; whilst embracing in-licensing and the acquisition of innovative therapies to counteract their impending portfolio weaknesses in the mid to longer term.The first part of the book provides an engaging and convincing perspective on the context in which the industry currently finds itself; the second part is a pragmatic guide to commercialising your intellectual property; including how to recognise and value what you have as well as the new ways of working that you will need to adopt when negotiating, collaborating and contracting in partnership and alliance with others.Commentators have described in great detail the cocktail of commercial, clinical and social issues that threaten to overwhelm the pharmaceutical industry; Martin Austin's book offers a very distinctive perspective on these issues and their solution.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5eae9b2b36f0f80bc8650b5cc6f0b0e091151ba0","amp;dn":"Licensing%2C+Selling+and+Finance+in+the+Pharmaceutical+and+Healthc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5eae9b2b36f0f80bc8650b5cc6f0b0e091151ba0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,174,155,43,54,240,248,11,200,101,11,92,198,240,176,224,145,21,27,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
