As such it lacks real insight into human potential and its\nproper rule through judicious use of power that is motivated by the greatest\nidealism rather than the expediencies of what is the status quo - fraught\nwith inadequacies as has generally always been so.\n\nMen must be taught what is right rather than what has generally worked well\nenough to keep them going. That is the ultimate failing in his message\nand of almost all others that continue to think this way today everywhere we\nlook on the world stage.\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d62d8aa4dad047e347126bf2a87c8cfe951b7a0","amp;dn":"The+Prince+by+Niccolo+Machiavelli+BBC+audio+and+more","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d62d8aa4dad047e347126bf2a87c8cfe951b7a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,98,216,170,77,173,4,126,52,113,38,191,42,135,200,207,233,81,183,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
