In addition, XANDRIA has re-recorded two all-time favorites of the band's fans, &quot;Ravenheart&quot; (originally recorded for the album &quot;Ravenheart&quot; in 2004) and &quot;Now &amp; Forever&quot; (&quot;India&quot;, 2005). Cover versions of SONATA ARCTICA's &quot;Don't Say A Word&quot; and Meat Loaf's &quot;I Would Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That)&quot; will also be included on the effort.\n\nRegarding the decision to cover &quot;I Would Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That)&quot;, XANDRIA said: &quot;During the photo shoot for the 'Sacrificium' record, we were digging through our music libraries to find something appropriate for getting us in the right mood. At some point we got stuck with an artist every one of us had a crush on someone with and a story to tell about back then from our teenager days in the earlier '90s. We straight away started joking about doing a XANDRIA version of this particular song, but really forgot about it until the discussion of doing some remake for an EP came up again. With the biggest respect we started this operation of transforming one of our all-time faves, a real classic, into a XANDRIA hymn. Well, we think we quite did an 'okay' job and on July the 31st, it's your turn to decide whether you've got a favorite song or not.&quot;\n\nÃÂ¢racks:\n1. Voyage Of The Fallen\n2. Unembraced\n3.
