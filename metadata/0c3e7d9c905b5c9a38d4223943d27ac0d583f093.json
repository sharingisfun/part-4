In terms of quality fans usually rate the album somewhere between the band's acclaimed debut, Life's Too Good and the widely panned follow-up Here Today, Tomorrow, Next Week!. The album provided the band's first and only hit, aptly titled &quot;Hit&quot;, which reached #1 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart in the U.S. and #17 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n&quot;Hit&quot; was covered by The X Factor contestant Diana Vickers on her 2010 debut album Songs from the Tainted Cherry Tree.\n\n***\nIf you have some Sugarcubes's singles in lossless flac, please share it!\nAlso, I'm looking for BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rk's SHM-CD release on FLAC, like Debut, Homogenic, Vespertine and Medulla.
