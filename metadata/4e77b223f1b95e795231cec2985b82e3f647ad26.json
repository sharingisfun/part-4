It became one of the best-known and successful reggae labels, but it also bought out several independent Jamaican labels and ended up with a pretty good ska and rock-steady back catalog. In 1972, it went through these archives and put out a fantastic (if somewhat inaccurately-named) compilation, The Trojan Story.\n\nAlthough the liner notes were somewhat sparse and the sound rough, you couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want a better overview of 1960s Jamaican music. The first tracks, from 1961, are embryonic ska in which you can hear the R &amp; B influence; it takes us through the height of ska to its migration to rock-steady, and then winding up with early reggae (it even includes what could be called the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œoriginalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ rock-steady and reggae songs: Alton EllisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRock SteadyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and The MaytalsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDo the ReggayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, respectively).\n\nThe three-disk box was only in print for a short time, and was reissued briefly in 1980 (in 1976, Trojan released a different compilation and also called it The Trojan Story, ensuring eternal confusion). In 1988, it was released on a 2-CD set, which also quickly went out of print; copies today sell for $50ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“75.\n\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve had the LP set for some time, but I was trying to track down a copy of the CD for the last few years. I finally found a reasonably priced copy, and the sound was awful. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s one of the worst mastering jobs IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve ever heard. They didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t go back to the original masters, but clearly just copied the LP, and didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even do a very good job of that. The copy I made off my LP sounded much better. So thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what we have here. Be sure to at least check out ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHousewivesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ChoiceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Great Wuga WugaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.
