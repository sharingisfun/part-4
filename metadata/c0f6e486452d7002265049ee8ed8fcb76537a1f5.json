He clearly has excellent contacts in the world of shadows. Wells is a complex and satisfying protagonist, tackling bad guys across the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conflict zones.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½--The New York Times Book Review\n\nJohn Wells goes undercover as the threat of nuclear war skyrockets between the United States and Iran, in the cutting-edge new novel from the #1 New York TimesÃ¢â‚¬â€œbestselling author.\n\nIn an Istanbul hotel, a deep source warns a CIA agent that Iran intends to kill a CIA station chief. Quickly, John Wells is called in to investigate, but before he can get far, the tip comes true. Which means that the next warning the source gives will be taken very seriously indeed. And itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a big one. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve put a package on a ship from Dubai to the United States. A radioactive one. A bomb? Not yet. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a test run.\n\nAs the threat level jumps and the government mobilizes, something still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t smell right to WellsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s old CIA boss Ellis Shafer, and so he sends Wells on a private mission to find out whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going on. But the two of them are swimming against the tide. From Guatemala to Thailand to Hong Kong to Istanbul, Wells uses every skill he has, including his ability to go undercover in the Arab world, to chase down leads. But it might not be enough. Soon there might be nothing anyone can do to pull the United States back from the brink of war.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre Reader ready. Metadata is complete and up to date.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0f6e486452d7002265049ee8ed8fcb76537a1f5","amp;dn":"The+Counterfeit+Agent+by+Alex+Berenson+%28ePub+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0f6e486452d7002265049ee8ed8fcb76537a1f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,246,228,134,69,45,112,2,38,80,73,238,142,216,252,183,101,55,161,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
