Adapted from the writings of the Marquis de Sade, Henri Xhonneux and Roland Topor&amp;#039;s elegantly witty film uses elaborate puppets in human form to act out erotic and sexual decadence. &quot;Elegantly naughty with wry, intellectual satire. The film plays out all manner of human desire&quot; (J. Hoberman). French with English subtitles.
