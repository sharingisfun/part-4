But it isn't the monster Conor's been expectingâ€” he's been expecting the one from his nightmare, the nightmare he's had nearly every night since his mother started her treatments. The monster in his backyard is different. It's ancient. And wild. And it wants something from Conor. Something terrible and dangerous. It wants the truth. From the final idea of award-winning author Siobhan Dowdâ€” whose premature death from cancer prevented her from writing it herselfâ€” Patrick Ness has spun a haunting and darkly funny novel of mischief, loss, and monsters both real and imagined","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0571895e046cba87916d766397f8941cd6b876db","amp;dn":"A+Monster+Calls+audiobook+by+Patrick+Ness+EarReaders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0571895e046cba87916d766397f8941cd6b876db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,113,137,94,4,108,186,135,145,109,118,99,151,248,148,28,214,184,118,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
