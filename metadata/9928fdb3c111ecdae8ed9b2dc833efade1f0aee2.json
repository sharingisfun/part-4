This wise and rapturous book is the story of how she left behind all these outward marks of success, and of what she found in their place. Following a divorce and a crushing depression, Gilbert set out to examine three different aspects of her nature, set against the backdrop of three different cultures: pleasure in Italy, devotion in India, and on the Indonesian island of Bali, a balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9928fdb3c111ecdae8ed9b2dc833efade1f0aee2","amp;dn":"Eat%2C+Pray%2C+Love+-+Elizabeth+Gilbert","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9928fdb3c111ecdae8ed9b2dc833efade1f0aee2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,40,253,179,193,17,236,218,232,237,155,45,200,51,239,173,225,240,174,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
