Author Aaron Dolberg demonstrates the different kinds of software testing (from black box to white box) and how to fit each one into your development cycle. Learn how to make sure your team is on the same page when it comes to quality by developing criteria for ranking the priority and severity of issues. Then find out how to test and report issues, and how to use a tracking system to manage the process and the results. Lastly, Aaron explains how automating some of the testing can make the QA process more efficient and objective. In the end, you'll be able to better understand the overall health of your product, and ensure your team is meeting quality goals with every release.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img707/876/2ztp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img707/876/2ztp.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nWe are on FaceBook, Post Your Request, suggestion, and find upcomming Release of Silver RG, you will find all Silver RG Encoders at FB Page so keep in touch\n\n\n\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, All SilverTorrentHD Encoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers \n\n:Support:\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say&quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9a80154d039081248cd4db270269faf2dd7a60b","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+Foundations+of+Programming%3A+Software+Quality+Assuran","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9a80154d039081248cd4db270269faf2dd7a60b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,168,1,84,208,57,8,18,72,205,77,178,112,38,159,175,45,215,166,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
