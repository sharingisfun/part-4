Of this group, half are those we think of as â€œpilgrims,â€ religious separatists who abandoned their prior lives for a single cause: religious freedom. The other half, the &quot;merchant adventurers,&quot; had less spiritual and more material, real-world objectives. This clash of values created complex inner struggles for the group as they sought to establish a new colony, compounded by a complicated relationship with the local Native American tribes. The conflicting allegiances among these groups culminated in trials of assimilation, faith, and compromise, that continued to define our nation to this day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSaints &amp; Strangers - Part 1 and Part 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Dates: 22-Nov-2015 and 23-Nov-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:020fc01451ac7b0ef7c07f64779a2b34ff5e3f88","amp;dn":"Saints+and+Strangers+Part+1+and+Part+2+480p.HDTV.x264-RMTeam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"020fc01451ac7b0ef7c07f64779a2b34ff5e3f88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,15,192,20,81,172,123,14,247,192,127,100,119,154,43,52,255,94,63,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
