In no small part thanks to Risen and State of War, the &quot;secret history&quot; of the Bush years has now come partially into view.\n\nIn a new epilogue for the paperback edition, Risen describes the two-front war that President Bush is now fighting: at home against Congress and the Supreme Court, as his administration is increasingly reined in from its abuses; and in the Middle East, where George W. Bush's great gamble to bring a democratic revolution is failing radically. We must learn the lessons of Risen's history now, before it is too late.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b259bf38f71be1199d56ae3940d732d0582c5c4","amp;dn":"James+Risen+-+State+of+War%3B+The+Secret+History+of+the+CIA+and+th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b259bf38f71be1199d56ae3940d732d0582c5c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,37,155,243,143,113,190,17,153,213,106,227,148,13,115,45,5,130,197,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
