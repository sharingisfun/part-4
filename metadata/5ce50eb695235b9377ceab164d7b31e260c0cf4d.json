At 11 a.m. \none morning, every village resident suddenly falls asleep -- and then, just as \nsuddenly, everyone wakes up, completely unaffected by the phenomenon. Well, not \ncompletely: virtually every woman of childbearing years has become pregnant. All \nthe babies are born on the same night, at precisely the same moment. All look \nthe same, weigh the same, and even have the same curious cross-hatched hair and \nunderdeveloped fingernails. Four years later, the children have all prematurely \nreached the age of nine or so -- and all behave in a weird, conspiratorial \nmanner, comporting themselves more like adults than kids. Resident scientist \nGeorge Sanders, one of the fathers, surmises that the bizarre manner of the \nchildren -- from their zombie-like movements to their cold, staring eyes -- is \nthe result of radioactivity, possibly extraterrestrial in nature. One thing is \ncertain: the children possess powers far beyond those of ordinary mortals. And \nthey must be stopped. One of the most influential science fiction films of the \n1960s, Village of the Damned was based on the equally eerie John Wyndham novel \nThe Midwich Cuckoos. The more explicit 1995 remake was widely panned in \ncomparison.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCAST\nGeorge Sanders          - Gordon Zellaby\nBarbara Shelley         - Anthea Zellaby\nMichael Gwynn           - Maj.

ItÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s scary; the boy is in a sudden position of authority \nover his dad. The grown-ups in the audience donÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t like the way it sounds.\n\nItÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s a good thing, then, that these same grown-ups werenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t around in the British \nvillage of Midwich circa 1950. In that sleepy hamlet the entire population \nsuffers from a brief blackout one day; a few months later, all the Midwich women \nof child-bearing age find that they were expecting, and the children, when they \ncome along, are not exactly like the other boys and girls. They are, in fact, \nexactly like one another: blonde, rather too intelligent for our comfort, and \npossessed of a particularly icy stare. To say that they are aloof is an \nunderstatement. And, perhaps most tellingly, they have a hive mentality: They \nkeep only one anotherÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s company, they communicate wordlessly, and when one of \nthese children learns a fact, the others automatically learn it too.\n\nSuch is the premise of the 1960 horror classic Village of the Damned, which was \nthe subject of a flaccid remake in 1995, and which is now available on DVD \ntogether with its sequel Children of the Damned (1963) along with a commentary \ntrack. Village of the Damned is a compendium of horror film virtues: It runs a \ntight 78 minutes, itÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s shot in a wintry black and white, its storytelling is \neconomical, and it frightens rather than startles. Any hack filmmaker can throw \na barking dog into the frame and jolt an unsuspecting audience. But in Village \nof the Damned director Wolf Rilla builds dread of these strange children through \ninsinuation and mood, and the audience gets the real thing: fear.\n\nBest of all, Village of the Damned demonstrates a surefire horror principle \nthatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s as simple and effective as it is underused: it never explains its central \nenigma away. Where most thrillers fall off the screen with dumbass, climactic \njustifications and explanations that strip them of their mystery (ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½It turned out \nto be a spider!ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Voodoo people did it!ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Pammy got a virus that made her want \nto eat brains!ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½), Village of the Damned has the class and the savvy to let what \nwent wrong in Midwich ride.\n\nThe primary action of the film centers on the children at school age, as they \nreact to the mounting fear and hostility they elicit from the grown-ups of the \nvillage. ThereÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s the matter of the childrenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s utter coldness, their alarming \nintelligence, a few unexplained deaths among their peers at school. But itÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s \nonly when an unlucky resident narrowly misses one of the children in his car \nthat we see what these kids can really do ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ what they can do when they put their \nmind to it, that is, and they only have one among them. Think of the film as the \nBritish uncle to Brian de PalmaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s The Fury and youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll begin to see what we mean.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMel Valentin (efilmcritic.com)\n\nReleased in 1960 (and directed by Wolf Rilla), &quot;Village of the Damned,&quot; the \nfirst adaptation of John WyndhamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s speculative fiction novel, &quot;The Midwich \nCuckoos&quot; (Wyndham preferred to describe his novels as ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½logical fantasiesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½), is \nthe rare science-fiction/horror film that, despite minimal special effects (or \naction scenes), remains highly watchable more than four decades after its \nrelease. In contrast, the 1995 remake directed by genre specialist John \nCarpenter has little to recommend it, besides passable special effects and gore. \nDue to a modest budget and the more cerebral source material (typical of British \nscience fiction), &quot;Village of the Damned&quot; depends on character, plot, conflict, \nand performance for its entertainment value. Casual science-fiction fans, \nhowever, may find &quot;Village of the DamnedÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s&quot; casual, deliberate pace and \nunanswered questions difficult to overlook.\n\nIn Village of the Damned, a quaint, rural village in England, Midwich, falls \nprey to a mysterious, odorless, invisible gas that sends all of the villageÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s \ninhabitants into prolonged, dreamless sleep. During the blackout (also called a \nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½timeoutÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ or ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½dayoutÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½), all the women of childbearing age become pregnant. For \nsome, like the protagonist Gordon Zellaby (George Sanders) and his wife, Anthea \n(Barbara Shelley), the news of her pregnancy brings happiness (heÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s considerably \nolder than she is, and her pregnancy seems to catch them by surprise). For \nothers in the village, the news of pregnancy has an opposite effect, raising the \nspecter of infidelity or premarital intercourse (and, therefore, social \nostracism). The men, of course, take to giving their wives and daughters \nglowering looks and wasting precious hours, silently, at the local pub.\n\nThe pregnancies are far from ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½normal.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ The fetuses grow at an accelerated rate, \nthe children are born almost simultaneously, and when born, share certain \nphysical characteristics, including blond hair and, when perplexed, glowing \neyes. Once out of the womb, the children continue to grow quickly, all the while \nexhibiting vast intellectual gifts (and later, mental telepathy and mind \ncontrol) minus emotional development. Their collective behavior indicates, as \none character puts it, a ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½mass mindÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ (i.e., a hive mind which places communal \ninterests and survival over individual self-interest). Even then, the children \nseem to speak through David (Martin Stephens), GordonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s ostensible ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½son.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Not \nsurprisingly, even as the childrenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s biological mothers display maternal \nfeelings toward their alien offspring, the other villagers react with fear, \ndread, anger, and a rising hysteria.\n\nNot everyone, however, reacts negatively toward the children. Gordon, a college \nprofessor, takes a detached, scientific interest in the children and their rapid \ndevelopment (despite obvious doubts about DavidÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s parentage). Gordon is the \nperfect example of the Enlightenment, placing his faith in material progress and \nscientific rationalism, thus creating a second layer or level of conflict, \nbetween scientific inquiry and self- or group-preservation (as advocated by the \nmilitary and the Home Office). Given the time period, thereÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s little doubt about \nthe childrenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s malevolent intentions, their plans for taking over their village \n(and later, the world), nor in GordonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s eventual response to the threat posed by \nthe children (hint, a brick wall is involved).\n\nBesides the premise, which translates subconscious fears about communism and its \nanti-individualist ethos into science-fiction metaphor (thus making Village of \nthe Damned an important film from a cultural and historical perspective) or \nwhich hints uncomfortably at Hitler's (mythic) super-race, Village of the Damned \nsucceeds due to a compelling storyline, sympathetic characters, and an \nunsettling dread intimately tied to children-as-villains. Children are usually \nperceived (and presented) as untainted innocents. Here, the alien children have \ninfiltrated and subverted the nuclear family, making their whims and desires \nparamount (their &quot;parents&quot; and human siblings are powerless to contradict or \noppose them). The discomfort elicited by the children can, in part, be traced to \nthe directions given the child actors by director Wolf Rilla. Rilla instructed \nhis young actors to remain still when on screen. ItÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s a subtle, almost \nimperceptible change in expected behavior that viewers are likely to perceive on \na subconscious level.\n\nOf course, the one major special effect, the alien childrenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s glowing eyes is \nespecially noteworthy, as is the central performance by Martin Stephens (equally \npreternatural and creepy in &quot;The Innocents&quot;) as the leader/spokesman for the \nalien children. Stephens is perfectly cast as the calculating, forceful leader \n(due, in large part, to his line deliveries). As Gordon Zellaby, George Sanders \ngives an against-the-grain, understated, controlled performance, befitting a \ncharacter guided more by intellect than emotion.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 PLEASE NOTICE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCheck you have installed the right codecs, as listed in this .nfo file, before\ntrying to play it.
