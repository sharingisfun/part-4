Ripped by me personally in high quality h.264, these episodes come straight from the UK DVD box set.\n\n\nWatch using VLC, or any other media player that supports MKV/h.264 (all the decent codec packs support it).\n\n\nAll 11 seasons are now up! I'll seed for a couple of days on this torrent, then I'll start them all up again with limited bandwidth for a little while longer, just to build up the health a little.\n\nEvery episode has been uploaded glitch free, without the annoying canned laughter (save one episode in season 7 that had no alternative audio track available) and in high quality h.264 for your viewing pleasure.\n\n***PLEASE***\n\nSeed for as long as you can, and always make sure you seed AT LEAST what you leech. I can't seed forever if you want new releases!\n\nSlip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4afe378457151f8c11a33c28d3cb081bde723777","amp;dn":"MASH+Season+11+-+No+Canned+Laughter+-+h.264+aac+HQ+%5BSlipTV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4afe378457151f8c11a33c28d3cb081bde723777","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,254,55,132,87,21,31,140,17,163,60,40,211,203,8,27,222,114,55,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
