Lester's follow-up film to his Class of 1984 is a rancidly violent \npeek at a near-future high school world of terror -- The Jetsons meet The \nTerminator. In Lester's world, total anarchy rules (at least in Seattle). \nClassrooms are sink-holes of violence, and around the kill-zone high schools \nFree Fire Zones are set up that look like re-creations of Dachau. Rival \nyouth gangs roam these areas with enough artillery for a second Vietnam War. \nThe gangs insane violence is exacerbated by a drug called Edge. When the \nDepartment of Educational Defence needs to supply new teachers, they look \nto a secret government agency headed by Dr. Bob Forrest (Stacy Keach) who \nsends new teaching recruits (Pam Grier, John P. Ryan, Joshua Miller) to \nthe beleaguered high school. These novice teachers are not your ordinary \nteaching-college graduates, however. They are tactical education units \ncyborgs reprogrammed to teach reading and writing and arithmetic. If \nthe students don't learn their daily assignments, they learn an even \nbigger lesson learn or die. The strict disciplinarian robots compel the \nstudent gangs to unite and fight the new educational menace. Under the \nleadership of Cody Culp (Bradley Gregg), who has just gotten out of reform \nschool and has seen that there is more to life than killing and cutting and \nEdge, the punks take up arms against the cyborgs who are invading their \nhigh-school turf.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Bradley Gregg.\n=&gt;-Traci Lind.\n=&gt;-Malcolm McDowell.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Mark L Lester.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Action : Horror : Sci-Fi.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1989.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.29 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 2 004 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 32 mn.\n=&gt;-Class Of 1999..............: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099277/\n=&gt;-Class Of 1999..............: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/class_of_1999/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 16:9.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 720 x 400.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1 888 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 150 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:187752dc1ff1d32df20fab8b12838f8b63384512","amp;dn":"Class+Of+1999+-+Sci-Fi+Horror+1989+Eng+Subs+%5BH246-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"187752dc1ff1d32df20fab8b12838f8b63384512","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,119,82,220,31,241,211,45,242,15,171,139,18,131,143,139,99,56,69,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
