While her beauÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s declaration initially seemed unusual, even antiquated, Stephanie accepted the challenge and got to work. Little did she know she was about to cook up the sexiest and most controversial love story of her generation.\n\n300 Sandwiches is the story of Stephanie and EÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s epic journey of bread and betrothal, with a whole loaf of recipes to boot. For Stephanie, a novice in the kitchen, making a sandwichÃ¢â‚¬â€or even 300Ã¢â‚¬â€for E wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just about getting a ring; it was her way of saying Ã¢â‚¬Å“I love youÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ while gaining confidence as a chef. It was about how many breakfast sandwiches they could eat together on future Sunday mornings, how many sÃ¢â‚¬â„¢mores might follow family snowboarding trips, how many silly fights would end in makeup sandwiches. Suddenly, she saw a lifetime of happiness between those two slices of bread.\n\nNot everyone agreed. The media dubbed E Ã¢â‚¬Å“the InternetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Worst BoyfriendÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; bloggers attacked the loving couple for setting back the cause of womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rights; opinions about their romance echoed from as far away as Japan. Soon, Stephanie found her cooking and her relationship under the harsh glare of the spotlight.\n\nFrom culinary twists on peanut butter and jelly to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Not Your MotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Roast BeefÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ spicy French Dip to Chicken and Waffle BLTs, Stephanie shares the creationsÃ¢â‚¬â€including wraps, burritos, paninis, and burgersÃ¢â‚¬â€that ultimately sated EÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s palate and won his heart. Part recipe book, part girl-meets-boy memoir, 300 Sandwiches teaches us that true love always wins outÃ¢â‚¬â€one delicious bite at a time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1326f07ed2de8f05ba6649aa03a3a51aff4aa780","amp;dn":"300+Sandwiches+-+Stephanie+Smith","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1326f07ed2de8f05ba6649aa03a3a51aff4aa780","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,38,240,126,210,222,143,5,186,102,73,170,3,163,165,26,255,74,167,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
