And they were just the beginning. &quot;England 1914&quot; is more than picture postcard nostalgia of a time and place, but a look into the hearts and minds of a country about to change beyond all expectations. The heart of McTell's inspiration has always been the blues, and he's repaid the debt often on record, so it's only fair that a collection should feature some of his best blues performances, including &quot;Too Tight Drag&quot; by his hero Blind Blake, a perfect illustration of McTell's guitar mastery (which has all too often been ignored), fingers running around the fretboard on a ragtime classic. McTell's tended to stand outside the frame of most singer/songwriters because many of his songs tend to be less personal that focus on characters, issues, and times. While the end result has possibly been a smaller long-term audience, the material itself stands up beautifully, work not only of feeling, but also craft, whether on the lighthearted (&quot;Granny Takes a Trip&quot;) or the deep (&quot;Daddy's Here&quot;). As introductions to an artist go, this is nigh on perfect, hitting many of the high spots. But with a career that's kept going strongly into the new millennium, there must, inevitably, be a volume two. \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/[/url]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c37aef42dece381b521b7ad1d0785710a225a8d","amp;dn":"Ralph+McTell...Streets+Of+London+-+The+Best+Of+Ralph+McTell%282000","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c37aef42dece381b521b7ad1d0785710a225a8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,55,174,244,45,236,227,129,181,33,183,173,29,7,133,113,10,34,90,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
