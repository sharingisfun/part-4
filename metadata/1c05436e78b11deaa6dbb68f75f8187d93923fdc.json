As such, it provides comprehensive information on material and process characteristics as well as applications regarding plastic laser welding.\nThe first part of this practical book introduces the structure and physical properties of plastics, before discussing the interaction of material and radiation in the NIR and IR spectral range. This is followed by an overview of the physical foundations of laser radiation and laser sources used for plastic welding. The third part describes the main processes of laser welding thermoplastics, as well as possibilities of process control, design of joint geometry, material compatibilities and adaptation of absorption of plastics to NIR radiation. Finally, the author explains applications of laser welding plastics using several industrial case studies from the automotive industry, household goods, and medical devices.\nTailored to the needs of everyone dealing with laser welding of plastics, especially engineers in packaging, component manufacturing, and the medical industry. \n\n\n# Hardcover: 260 pages\n# Publisher: Wiley-VCH; 1 edition (November 22, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 3527409726\n# ISBN-13: 978-3527409723","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c05436e78b11deaa6dbb68f75f8187d93923fdc","amp;dn":"Laser+Welding+of+Plastics+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c05436e78b11deaa6dbb68f75f8187d93923fdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,5,67,110,120,177,29,234,166,219,182,143,117,248,24,125,147,146,63,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
