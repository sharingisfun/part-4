Before the authors release the source code, it was just a good reference for someone already familiar with the core profile, and it was kind of similar to the other excellent OpengGL Cookbooks from Packt Publishing. The cookbooks present great source codes for experimentation but lack some detail for full comprehension.\nNow the source code is available and seems to be well organized and good quality as opposed to OpenGL Redbook 8ed. This is the best core profile tutorial book on the market. The codes compiled out of the box. Note that you'll need a good graphic card with OpenGL 4.2 support (which can be changed to other version in sb6.h.) If the code compile successfully but display a window and then exist, you might not have the correct graphic driver support.\nHopefully, some day the RedBook source code will catch up to this one. \n\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nInfo on the example codes: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.openglsuperbible.com/example-code/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.openglsuperbible.com/example-code/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nUploaded anomyously.\nDo not stop at what you're doing. But do stop when you can no longer continue. Rest, rinse, repeat.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85bb77261f90b146a82662c85647898b847e0ddd","amp;dn":"OpenGL+SuperBible+6th+Edition+%2B+Example+Codes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85bb77261f90b146a82662c85647898b847e0ddd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,187,119,38,31,144,177,70,168,38,98,200,86,71,137,139,132,126,13,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
