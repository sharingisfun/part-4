In this course, author James Williamson introduces the technology that makes the web run, the terminology involved, and how it all comes together to power the websites we know and love. He covers the alphabet soup of technologies involved (HTML, CSS, URL, DNS, HTTP, and IPv6), and explains what separates the front end (what we see) from the back end (what we don't) on the web. This course is your &quot;plain English&quot; guide to the world of domains, databases, servers, and the technology that makes the web work.\n\nTopics include:\n\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tWorking with web clients and servers\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tExploring HTTP\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tHow browsers work\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tStructuring HTML\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tControlling presentation with CSS\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tScripting with JavaScript\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tDealing with data\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tWorking with a content management system (like WordPress)\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tUsing cloud services\n\n\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e134df056b6f0f326b6cdd3f279cf82b01bfd02","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Web+Technology+Fundamentals+with+James+Williamson+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e134df056b6f0f326b6cdd3f279cf82b01bfd02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,19,77,240,86,182,240,243,38,182,205,211,242,121,207,130,176,27,253,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
