Anxious to compete, Russian prospectors commissioned inventor Leviticus Blue to create a great machine that could mine through AlaskaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ice. Thus was Dr. BlueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Incredible Bone-Shaking Drill Engine born.\n\nBut on its first test run the Boneshaker went terribly awry, destroying several blocks of downtown Seattle and unearthing a subterranean vein of blight gas that turned anyone who breathed it into the living dead.\n\nNow it is sixteen years later, and a wall has been built to enclose the devastated and toxic city. Just beyond it lives BlueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s widow, Briar Wilkes. Life is hard with a ruined reputation and a teenaged boy to support, but she and Ezekiel are managing. Until Ezekiel undertakes a secret crusade to rewrite history.\n\nHis quest will take him under the wall and into a city teeming with ravenous undead, air pirates, criminal overlords, and heavily armed refugees. And only Briar can bring him out alive.\n\n\nRead by Graphic Audio\nFormat: MP3\nDramatization","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d5080d37cedaea103a5e5709fdd93b3d77a8523","amp;dn":"Cherie+Priest+-+Boneshaker+%28The+Clockwork+Century+%231%29+%5BGraphic+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d5080d37cedaea103a5e5709fdd93b3d77a8523","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,80,128,211,124,237,174,161,3,165,229,112,159,221,147,179,215,122,133,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
