(1963) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  I Started Out as a Child (1964) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Revenge (1967) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  To Russell, My Brother, Whom I Slept With (1968)\n\nMP3s, 160 kbps\n\n\nAs always, support your artists by buying their albums for real if you like them and paying to watch their live shows, and in this case buy his books, DVDs, etc. And since he is the one and only Dr. Huxtable, also eat plenty of Jello products. I'm sure he still gets kick-backs for every push-pop sold worldwide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e648c7ad94affe5bf2a126f4b5266922cd5e0893","amp;dn":"Bill+Cosby+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+4+early+stand-up+comedy+albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e648c7ad94affe5bf2a126f4b5266922cd5e0893","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,72,199,173,148,175,254,91,242,161,38,244,181,38,105,34,205,94,8,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
