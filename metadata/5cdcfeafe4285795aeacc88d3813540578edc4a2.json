Korn began their existence as the Bakersfield, CA-based metal band LAPD, which included guitarists James &quot;Munky&quot; Shaffer and Brian &quot;Head&quot; Welch, bassist Reginald &quot;Fieldy Snuts&quot; Arvizu, and drummer David Silveria. After issuing an LP, the members of LAPD in 1993 crossed paths with Jonathan Davis, a mortuary science student moonlighting as the lead vocalist for the local group Sexart. They soon asked Davis to join the band, and upon his arrival the quintet rechristened itself Korn.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Uber-Time\n02.Oildale (Leave Me Alone)\n03.Pop A Pill\n04.Fear Is A Place To Live\n05.Move On\n06.Lead The Parade\n07.Let The Guilt Go\n08.The Past\n09.Never Around\n10.Are You Ready To Live\n11.Holding All These Lies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cdcfeafe4285795aeacc88d3813540578edc4a2","amp;dn":"Korn+-+Korn+III+Remember+Who+You+Are+%282010%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cdcfeafe4285795aeacc88d3813540578edc4a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,220,254,175,228,40,87,149,174,172,200,141,56,19,84,5,120,237,196,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
