With each successive album, they pushed the musical envelope with a fusion of progressive rock, electronica, and Radiohead-influenced experimentation, creating an emotive, passionate sound. Muse's reputation as one of the best live rock bands in the world is well deserved with their exhilirating live performances drewing critical acclaim, industry buzz, and a loyal and rabid fan base.\n\nTracks:\n\n01  Uprising\n02  Resistance\n03  Undisclosed Desires\n04  United States Of Eurasia [Collateral Damage]\n05  Guiding Light\n06  Unnatural Selection\n07  MK Ultra\n08  I Belong To You [Mon Coeur S'ouvre A Ta Voix]\n09  Exogenesis Symphony Part 1 [Overture]\n10  Exogenesis Symphony Part 2 [Cross-Pollination]\n11  Exogenesis Symphony Part 3 [Redemption]\n\nEnjoy, SvC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2f990217c7bc86678f0c59d8f4dbb3c15c9d44b","amp;dn":"Muse+-+The+Resistance+%5B2009-mp3-vbr%5D+%5BSvC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2f990217c7bc86678f0c59d8f4dbb3c15c9d44b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,249,144,33,124,123,200,102,120,240,197,157,143,77,187,60,21,201,212,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
