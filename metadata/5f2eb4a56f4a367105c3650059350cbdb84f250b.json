There is little evidence of sophomore slump in this three-disc collection of 18 episodes that continue the coming-of-age trials of third graders Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny. There is considerable shock value just in the episode titles alone, among them &quot;Cojoined Fetus Lady,&quot; &quot;Merry Christmas, Charlie Manson,&quot; and the infamous &quot;Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut.&quot; But mostly, the episodes are just--in Cartman's words--hella funny. &quot;Spookyfish&quot; is a creepfest about a killer fish, possessed animals, and alien alter egos (in which the so-called Evil Cartman is much nicer than the real Cartman) presented in Spookyvision, with pictures of Barbra Streisand framing the screen. &quot;Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls&quot; is a hilarious send-up of the Sundance Film Festival and the indie film scene that marks the return of Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo, and ends with the burial of Robert Redford in excrement.\n\nAs always, hard-earned life lessons provide South Park with fertile territory for skewed and subversive social commentary. In &quot;Chicken Lover,&quot; Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged is an argument against literacy. &quot;Underwear Gnomes&quot; makes a strong case for corporate takeover of local family business. It is difficult to respect Warner Bros.' &quot;authoritah&quot; with the scant DVD extras. There are no commentaries, but Parker and Stone are present to introduce most of the episodes, each of which they proclaim to be their favorite. But their incarnations as abusive retirement center entertainers and as the hosts of an all-bacon cooking show fall flat. Bring back Rootin'-Tootin' Trey Parker and Pistol-Slingin' Matt Stone from the Season One set! --Donald Liebenson\n\nEpisode Index:\n\n&quot;Terrance &amp; Phillip in Not Without My Anus&quot;\nOriginal Air Date: 04-01-1998\nAn episode featuring Terrance and Phillip, who must save Canada from Saddam Hussein.\n\n&quot;CartmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Mom is Still a Dirty Slut&quot;\nOriginal Air Date: 04-22-1998\nChef and the boys rush to the hospital to check on Mephesto, who's gunned down just as he's set to reveal the identity of Cartman's father.
