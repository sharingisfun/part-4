As adults, theyâ€™ve been estranged for years, until circumstances force them to come together to protect Roseâ€™s daughter. Ten-year-old Antoinette has a severe form of autism that requires constant care and attention. She has never spoken a word, but she has a powerful gift that others would give anything to harness: she can heal things with her touch. She brings wilted flowers back to life, makes a neighborâ€™s tremors disappear, changes the normal course of nature on the Kentucky flower farm where she and her mother live. \r\nAntoinetteâ€™s gift, though, puts her own life in danger, as each healing comes with an increasingly deadly price. As Roseâ€”the center of her daughterâ€™s lifeâ€”struggles with her own failing health, and Lily confronts her anguished past, they, and the men who love them, come to realize the sacrifices that must be made to keep this very special child safe. \r\nWritten with great heart and a deep understanding of what it feels like to be â€œdifferent,â€ The Peculiar Miracles of Antoinette Martin is a novel about what it means to be family, and about the lengths to which people will go to protect the ones they love.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a014adeaf868c08a22334f01b488a0057539162","amp;dn":"The+Peculiar+Miracles+of+Antoinette+Martin+-+Stephanie+Knipper+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a014adeaf868c08a22334f01b488a0057539162","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,1,74,222,175,134,140,8,162,35,52,240,27,72,138,0,87,83,145,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
