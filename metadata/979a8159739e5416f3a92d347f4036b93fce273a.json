Pagford is, seemingly, an English idyll, with a cobbled market square and an ancient abbey, but what lies behind the pretty faÃƒÂ§ade is a town at war. Rich at war with poor, teenagers at war with their parents, wives at war with their husbands, teachers at war with their pupilsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. Pagford is not what it first seems. And the empty seat left by Barry on the townÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s council soon becomes the catalyst for the biggest war the town has yet seen. Who will triumph in an election fraught with passion, duplicity and unexpected revelations? Blackly comic, thought-provoking and constantly surprising, The Casual Vacancy is J.K. RowlingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first novel for adults.\n\nFormats provided are:\n.ePub -\nCompatible with most eReaders including the Apple iPad.
