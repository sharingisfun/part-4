Every story has its own unique twists and turns, as well as insights into the mind of each inventor, revealing how each overcame seemingly insurmountable obstacles to become a success.\r\n\r\nEach hour contains multiple stories that are not only aspirational, inspirational, and identifiable; but they are also packed with plenty of drama and big money payoffs.&quot;\r\n\r\n____________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nName (Title): MILLION DOLLAR Genius - Complete Season 1 S01 - 720p HDTV x264.\r\n\r\nCategory Type: TV Series.\r\n\r\nLength (Duration): 40+ Minutes per Episode.\r\n\r\nYear(s): 2016.\r\n\r\nStarring: Dominique Ansel, Rico Elmore, Michael Boehm, Bob Plath, etc.\r\n\r\nGenre(s): Documentary, Family, Inspirational.\r\n\r\nResolution: 720p.\r\n\r\nRip Type (Source): HDTV.\r\n\r\nCodec Type: x264.\r\n\r\nFormat of File(s): MP4(s).\r\n\r\nAudio Format &amp; Language(s): AC3 5.1 6-Channel (ENGLISH Audio). \r\n\r\nSubtitles: No.\r\n\r\nChapters: No.\r\n\r\nMore Info: http://www.history.com/shows/million-dollar-genius","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc9fbf9f65bcbc2353c2fd9b970164bd44b5fa22","amp;dn":"MILLION+DOLLAR+Genius+-+Complete+Season+1+S01+-+720p+HDTV+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc9fbf9f65bcbc2353c2fd9b970164bd44b5fa22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,159,191,159,101,188,188,35,83,194,253,155,151,1,100,189,68,181,250,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
