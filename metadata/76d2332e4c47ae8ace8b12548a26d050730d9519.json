As an Auschwitz survivor, he became an eloquent witness for the six million Jews slaughtered in World War II and, more than anyone else, seared the memory of the Holocaust on the world's conscience.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Germans' systematic massacre of Jews, no voice had emerged to drive home the enormity of what had happened and how it had changed mankind's conception of itself and of God.  Wiesel's work filled that void, and it was this speaking out against forgetfulness and violence that the Nobel committee recognized when he received the Peace Prize in 1986: &quot;Wiesel is a messenger to mankind,&quot; the citation said.  &quot;His message is one of peace, atonement and human dignity.  His belief that the forces fighting evil in the world can be victorious is a hard-won belief.&quot;\n\nWiesel first gained attention in 1960 with the English translation of NIGHT, an autobiographical account of the horrors he witnessed as a teenage boy in the Auschwitz, Buna, and Buchenwald concentration camps.  He went on to write novels, books of essays and reportage, two plays and even two cantatas.  While many of his books were nominally about topics like Soviet Jews or Hasidic masters, they all dealt with profound questions resonating out of the Holocaust: What is the sense of living in a universe that tolerates unimaginable cruelty?  How could the world have been mute?  How can one go on believing?  Wiesel asked the questions in spare prose and without raising his voice; he rarely offered answers.\n\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB format unless otherwise indicated:\n\n\n                                    == FICTION ==\n\n* Dawn [Night Trilogy II] (Hill &amp; Wang, 2006).
