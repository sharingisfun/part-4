The emergence of new materials and new disciplines, together with the escalating use of on- and off-line computers for rapid data processing and the combined use of experimental and numerical techniques have greatly expanded the capabilities of experimental mechanics. New exciting topics are included on biological materials, MEMS and NEMS, nanoindentation, digital photomechanics, photoacoustic characterization, and atomic force microscopy in experimental solid mechanics.\n\nPresenting complete instructions to various areas of experimental solid mechanics, guidance to detailed expositions in important references, and a description of state-of-the-art applications in important technical areas, this thoroughly revised and updated edition is an excellent reference to a widespread academic, industrial, and professional engineering audience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da14d5ca91151b8e7434fe335ba997f1a78d53d4","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2008%5D+Springer+Handbook+of+Experimental+Solid+Mechanics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da14d5ca91151b8e7434fe335ba997f1a78d53d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,20,213,202,145,21,27,142,116,52,254,51,91,169,151,241,167,141,83,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
