It was the year Americans attempted and accomplished outsized things and came of age in a big, brawling manner. What a country. What a summer. And what a writer to bring it all so vividly alive for us in this certain best-seller.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:133c16aa4e975dd3dd3599b5d8c743f2285fe501","amp;dn":"One+Summer%3A+America%2C+1927+-+Bill+Bryson+-+Audiobook+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"133c16aa4e975dd3dd3599b5d8c743f2285fe501","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,60,22,170,78,151,93,211,221,53,153,181,216,199,67,242,40,95,229,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
