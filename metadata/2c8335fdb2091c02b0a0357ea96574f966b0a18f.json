Author Nick Schade presents complete plans for three boats of different types (canoe, kayak, and a dinghy) and shows you step-by-step how to build them. Written for all amateur builders, the book covers materials, tools, and safety issues.\nAbout the Author\n\nNick Schade runs Guillemot Kayaks, one of the best-known providers of plans and kits for strip-built kayaks. He has written feature articles for Sea Kayaker and other magazines.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 288 pages\n    * Publisher: International Marine/Ragged Mountain Press; 1 edition (March 23, 2009)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0071475249\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0071475242","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c8335fdb2091c02b0a0357ea96574f966b0a18f","amp;dn":"Building+Strip-+Planked+Boats%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c8335fdb2091c02b0a0357ea96574f966b0a18f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,131,53,253,178,9,28,2,176,160,53,126,169,101,116,249,102,176,161,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
