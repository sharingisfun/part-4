It dramatises events in the Maze prison in the six weeks prior to Sands death. The film opens with prison guard, Raymond Lohan (Stuart Graham) preparing to leave for work; checking under his car for bombs, putting on his uniform in the locker room and ignoring the camaraderie of his colleagues. Davey (Brian Milligan), a new IRA prisoner arrives at the gaol, following his refusal to wear the prison uniform, he is labeled &quot;non-cooperative.&quot; His new roommate, Gerry (Liam McMahon), has smeared the cell with faeces from floor to ceiling and we witness their resistance to the prison regime. Sands is the focus of the film. He deeply believes in the cause that he was imprisoned for and in the righteousness of dying for political prisoner status. In one of the film's most notable scenes Sands debates the morality of the hunger strike with a visiting priest (Liam Cunningham). \n\nVideo \n\nFormat....[XviD\nFrame Rate.......[25.000 FPS\nAspect Ratio.....[640x272\nVideo Bitrate....[860 kb/s\nAudio Format....[192 kb/s AC3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b714911e8a6752771deca8538b673b59657e76df","amp;dn":"Hunger.2008.LiMiTED.DVDRiP.XViD-HLS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b714911e8a6752771deca8538b673b59657e76df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,20,145,30,138,103,82,119,29,236,168,83,139,103,59,89,101,126,118,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
