The NX designation indicates that this Enterprise is an experimental prototype; Archerâ€™s ship is Earthâ€™s first vessel designed for long-range exploration of the galaxy.  Prior to the development of warp engines that could reach a velocity of warp 5, missions of this nature were impossible.  At warp 2, only a handful of inhabited planets were within a yearâ€™s travel from Earth.  But at warp 5, that number increases to ten thousand planets!  It is Archerâ€™s job to visit as many of those worlds as he can.  At 190 meters long, the NX-01 is a bit smaller than Kirkâ€™s Enterprise, and carries a crew complement of just eighty-three men and women, all human, with the exception of the Vulcan science officer and the Denobulan doctor.  Unlike the starships of the four other Star Trek series, this Enterprise doesnâ€™t have deflector shields or phasers, but it does come equipped with a phase cannon and a rudimentary transporter that functions efficiently most of the time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d88819680d77f6ff2c96c5c6ff513b6a2110c952","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+Enterprise+-+Seasons+3+and+4+-+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d88819680d77f6ff2c96c5c6ff513b6a2110c952","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,136,25,104,13,119,246,255,44,150,197,198,255,81,59,106,33,16,201,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
