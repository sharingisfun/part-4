But where did it come from? Why does it matter? And what does the content renaissance mean for you? This brief guide explores content strategyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s roots, and quickly and expertly demonstrates not only how itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s done, but how you can do it well.

The Craft of Content Strategy\nChapter 3. Tools and Techniques\n\nBonus Track: How Do I Get In?\n\nAbout the Author\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a content strategist, editor, and writer. I help people plan for, design, make, publish, and maintain really good content online. I live in NYC and work for Brain Traffic, a fantastico content strategy consultancy in Minneapolis. Before joining Brain Traffic, I was an indie content specialist, the editorial director of Happy Cog Studios, and a freelance writer and editor.\n\nMy new book, The Elements of Content Strategy, was published in March of 2011 by A Book Apart. You can read an excerpt at A List Apart magazine, or buy it direct from the publisher in a beautiful paperback edition, as a set of DRM-free ebook files, or both.\n\nBook Details\nPaperback: 79 pages\nPublisher: A Book Apart (2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0984442553\nISBN-13: 978-0984442553","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee9050fd65c13bf99ad463645c3f0009af074528","amp;dn":"The+Elements+Of+Content+Strategy+V413HAV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee9050fd65c13bf99ad463645c3f0009af074528","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,144,80,253,101,193,59,249,154,212,99,100,92,63,0,9,175,7,69,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
