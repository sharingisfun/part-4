A partial return to their rock roots, although with a much lighter approach, the record has also the heaviest electronics amongst all group albums. In comparison, rock was mostly absent on their previous effort Hot Space, which gave room to dance and funk with the use of analogue synths and brass. Freddie Mercury praised the album saying it helped re-establish the band, especially in Europe. The Works is estimated to have sold 12 million copies worldwide.\n\nRecorded at the Record Plant Studios and Musicland Studios from August 1983 to January 1984, the album's title comes from a comment drummer Roger Taylor made as recording began Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;Let's give them the works!&quot;\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Radio Ga Ga&quot;   \tRoger Taylor \t5:44\n02. \t&quot;Tear It Up&quot;   \tBrian May \t3:28\n03. \t&quot;It's a Hard Life&quot;   \tFreddie Mercury \t4:08\n04. \t&quot;Man on the Prowl&quot;   \tMercury \t3:28\n05. \t&quot;Machines (Or 'Back to Humans')&quot;   \tMay, Taylor \t5:10\n06. \t&quot;I Want to Break Free&quot;   \tJohn Deacon \t3:20\n07. \t&quot;Keep Passing the Open Windows&quot;   \tMercury \t5:21\n08. \t&quot;Hammer to Fall&quot;   \tMay \t4:28\n09. \t&quot;Is This the World We Created...?&quot;   \tMercury, May \t2:13\n\n2011 Bonus EP\n\n01. \t&quot;I Go Crazy (B-Side)&quot;   \t \n02. \t&quot;I Want To Break Free (Single Remix)&quot;   \t \n03. \t&quot;Hammer To Fall (HeadbangerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mix)&quot;   \t \n04. \t&quot;Is This The World We CreatedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦?
