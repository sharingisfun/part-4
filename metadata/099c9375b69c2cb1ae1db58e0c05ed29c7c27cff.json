The band has undergone several major changes in personnel and genres through the years while retaining the same Jefferson Starship name. The current Jefferson Starship, led by co-founder Paul Kantner, more closely resembles its original mix of psychedelic and electric folk music than the pop-driven tunes it was widely known for in the early to mid-1980s. It is not to be confused with Starship, a spin-off of the group featuring former co-lead singer Mickey Thomas that also periodically tours. The latter group is most frequently identified with the 1980s pop tunes of the Jefferson Starship.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:099c9375b69c2cb1ae1db58e0c05ed29c7c27cff","amp;dn":"Jefferson+Starship-Original+Album+Classics+%5B5CD%5D%5B2009%5D%5B320KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"099c9375b69c2cb1ae1db58e0c05ed29c7c27cff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,156,147,117,182,156,44,177,174,29,181,142,12,5,237,41,199,194,124,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
