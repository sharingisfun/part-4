Roosevelt in the United States, and the 1933 seizure of power by Adolf Hitler in Germany.\n\nEach of these events introduced some variant of socialism into a major country Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ® i.e., Bolshevik socialism in Russia, New Deal socialism in the United States, and National socialism in Germany.\n\nContemporary academic histories, with perhaps the sole exception of Carroll Quigley's Tragedy And Hope, ignore this evidence. On the other hand, it is understandable that universities and research organizations, dependent on financial aid from foundations that are controlled by this same New York financial elite, would hardly want to support and to publish research on these aspects of international politics. The bravest of trustees is unlikely to bite the hand that feeds his organization.\n\nIt is also eminently clear from the evidence in this trilogy that &quot;public-spirited businessmen&quot; do not journey to Washington as lobbyists and administrators in order to serve the United States. They are in Washington to serve their own profit-maximising interests. Their purpose is not to further a competitive, free-market economy, but to manipulate a politicized regime, call it what you will, to their own advantage.\n\nIt is business manipulation of Hitler's accession to power in March 1933 that is the topic of Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e84c910f984327ee0a6dea5f4cc7a3e4f6d3cd7c","amp;dn":"Antony+Cyril+Sutton+-+1976+-+Wall+Street+And+The+Rise+Of+Adolf+H","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e84c910f984327ee0a6dea5f4cc7a3e4f6d3cd7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,76,145,15,152,67,39,238,10,109,234,95,76,199,163,228,246,211,205,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
