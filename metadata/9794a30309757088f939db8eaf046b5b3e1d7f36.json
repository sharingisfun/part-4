Rather than comment on politics or racism, let me just say that (whatever your personal political views), it is amazing that a book as disjointed, pedantic, or badly written as this could have had the positive effect on the NSDAP that it did. I recall reading a biography on Hitler once that noted this book was one of the most purchased and least read books of all time. In any event, it is a hugely important historical document, and trying to find a decent audio quality English-version is no easy trick. I found this copy on a private tracker with only a few seeders, and since I believe in freedom of ALL information, it seemed appropriate to give it a wider audience. My guess is that very few people are going to be able to get through this tangled morass of bad grammar and pompous rhetoric, even if they happen to agree with the twit.\n\nThe history and textual explanations at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mein_kampf are very well done by way of a study aid, and I couldnÃƒÂ¢??t help including this tidbit about the extent to which the book is still banned:\n\n\nThe government of Bavaria, in agreement with the federal government of Germany, does not allow any copying or printing of the book in Germany and opposes it also in other countries but with less success. Owning and buying the book is legal. Trading in old copies is legal as well unless it is done in such a fashion as to ÃƒÂ¢??promote hatred or warÃƒÂ¢??, which is, under anti-revisionist laws, generally illegal. In particular, the unmodified edition is not covered by Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§86 StGB that forbids dissemination of means of propaganda of unconstitutional organizations, since it is a ÃƒÂ¢??pre-constitutional workÃƒÂ¢?? and as such cannot be opposed to the free and democratic basic order, according to a 1979 decision of the Federal Court of Justice of Germany.[7] Most German libraries carry heavily commented and excerpted versions of Mein Kampf.\nElsewhere in the world, the situation is as follows:\n \tTranslated into Arabic, the book has been widely distributed in the Arab world from the 1930s to the present. \n \tMein Kampf is freely available in Australia (ISBN 0-395-92503-7), Canada (ISBN 0-395-07801-6), Colombia, Finland (ISBN 1-59364-006-4), Greece, India (ISBN 81-87981-29-6), Ireland, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Portugal, Republic of Macedonia (ISBN 9989-920-54-0), and South Korea. \n \tIn Austria, the possession and/or trading of Mein Kampf is illegal. \n \tIn Bulgaria, it&amp;#039;s publishing caused some controversies but is freely available for selling since 2001. \n \tIn Croatia, Mein Kampf was published in 1999, second edition in 2003, and the German language edition in 2002. \n \tIn the Czech Republic, Mein Kampf was first sold in the Czech lands in 1936, and again in 1993, both times in abridged, annotated versions. In March 2000, the full Czech edition was published by Otakar II. [8] \n \tIn Denmark the book can be bought[9] and 50 copies are available in the public libraries[10] \n \tIn France, the selling of the book is forbidden unless the transaction concerns a historical version including commentaries from specialists and states the law allowing its special historical edition. In 2002, a French court ruled that the company Yahoo! had to pay ÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¬100,000 per diem for selling revisionist materials, including Mein Kampf and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, to French customers.[11] \n \tIn Indonesia the book is available in Indonesian language. \n \tIn Lebanon, an Arabic edition of Mein Kampf was published in 1995 by Bisan/Beisan.[12] \n \tIn Mexico, Mein Kampf cannot be found in the largest book stores or libraries because they say its selling is prohibited, but can be encountered in some small book stores and among ÃƒÂ¢??pirateÃƒÂ¢?? book vendors in Mexico City and other cities. \n \tIn the Netherlands, selling the book, even in the case of an old copy, may be illegal as ÃƒÂ¢??promoting hatredÃƒÂ¢??, but possession and lending is not. Though mainly the matter is handled as a matter of copyright infringement as the Dutch state (as acclaimed owner of the translation) will not allow any publishing. In 1997, the government explained to the parliament that selling a scientifically annotated version might escape prosecution. In 2007, the discussion flared up again and the same arguments for and against as in 1997 were uttered. In 2015, the copyright on the Dutch translation becomes void. \n \tIn Spain and Argentina, the book is unavailable, but copies before the unavailability of the book still exist. (Note: recent changes may have changed this status.) \n \tWhen Mein Kampf was republished in Sweden in 1992, the government of Bavaria tried to put a ban on the book. The case went all the way to the Swedish Supreme Court. The court ruled in 1998 that the copyright could not be owned by the modern state of Bavaria. Since the publishing house that published Mein Kampf in the thirties had long gone out of business, Mein Kampf should be considered as being in a state of limbo (or even in the public domain). The case was won by the modern publisher, an outspoken anti-Nazi. \n \tIn Turkey, the book is freely available and a Turkish edition was reported to be a bestseller in Turkey in March 2005, selling over 100,000 copies in two months.[13] \n \tIn the USSR, the book was unavailable and de facto prohibited. In the Russian Federation, Mein Kampf has been published at least three times since 1992; the Russian text is also available on a number of web-sites. Recently the Public Chamber of Russia proposed to ban the book. \n \tIn the United Kingdom, Mein Kampf is readily available and sells 3,000 copies annually [8]. \n \tIn 1999, the Simon Wiesenthal Center documented that major Internet booksellers like amazon.com and barnesandnoble.com sell Mein Kampf to Germany. After a public outcry, both companies agreed to stop those sales. The book is currently available through both companies. Public-domain copies of Mein Kampf are available at various Internet sites with links to banned books. Additionally, several Web sites provide the text of the book. \n \tIn the United States, the book can be found at almost any community library and can be bought, sold, and traded from many websites like Amazon.com and Borders Book Store. The U.S. government seized the copyright during the Second World War as part of the Trading with the Enemy Act and in 1979, Houghton Mifflin, the U.S. publisher of the book, bought the rights from the government. More than 15,000 copies are sold a year.[8] \n \tThere is a Chilean, edition that is a Spanish translation, the book is completely available, and encompass the two parts. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9794a30309757088f939db8eaf046b5b3e1d7f36","amp;dn":"Mein+Kampf+%28My+Struggle%29+-+Adolf+Hitler+-+Unabridged+English+aud","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9794a30309757088f939db8eaf046b5b3e1d7f36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,148,163,3,9,117,112,136,249,57,219,142,175,4,107,91,62,29,127,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
