In 2000, he won a Grammy for best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal with latin rock musician Carlos Santana for &quot;Put Your Lights On.&quot; (see 1999 in music).\n\nEmerging as a member of the Rhyme Syndicate, Everlast's first solo album Forever Everlasting (1990)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½which was largely made possible by MC Ice TÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½failed both critically and commercially. Following the album's flop, Everlast formed House of Pain with friends DJ Lethal and Danny Boy. Signed to Tommy Boy Records, the group's 1992 eponymous debut album went multi-platinum with the hit single &quot;Jump Around.&quot; The group eventually disbanded in 1996, and Everlast once again pursued a solo career.\n\nWhitey Ford Sings the Blues (1998) is the second solo album by singer-songwriter-emcee Everlast, and the first one following his departure from House of Pain. It was released a full eight years after his solo debut (Forever Everlasting) and after he had a major heart attack.\n\nWhitey Ford Sings the Blues was both a commercial and critical success (selling more than 3 million copies). It was hailed for its blend of rap with acoustic and electric guitars, developed by Everlast together with producers Dante Ross and John Gamble (aka SD50). The album's genre-crossing lead single &quot;What It's Like&quot; proved to be his most popular and successful song, although the follow up single, &quot;Ends&quot;, also reached the rock top 10. &quot;Painkillers&quot; was included on the soundtrack to the 1999 Jet Li film Black Mask.\n\nEverlast followed-up this success by collaborating with Santana on the track &quot;Put Your Lights On&quot; on Santana's 1999 album Supernatural. It charted at #118 on the pop chart, but did considerably better with rock radio airplay, peaking at #8 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Put Your Lights On&quot; won Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 2000 Grammy Awards. At the end of the song, Everlast can be heard singing the first part of the Shahadah &quot;La ilaha illa Allah&quot;, the Islamic profession of faith.\n\nDespite the success of Whitey Ford Sings the Blues and his success with Santana, Everlast's follow-up album, Eat at Whitey's (2000), failed commercially at first in the United States. However, it was eventually certified gold. The album was also embraced critically, especially by Rolling Stone Magazine which reviewed the album between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;great&quot; and focused on it as that month's most important release.\n\n\n\n\nWhitey Ford Sings The Blues \n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;The White Boy is Back&quot; \n2.\t&quot;Money (Dollar Bill)&quot; (f.
