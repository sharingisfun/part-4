Conceiving every movie made, he acted as producer and screenwriter. Despite this control, he was underwhelmed by the available talent and took drastic steps, ordering the kidnapping of Choi Eun-Hee (Madam Choi)Ã¢â‚¬â€South KoreaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most famous actressÃ¢â‚¬â€and her ex-husband Shin Sang-Ok, the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most famous filmmaker. \n\nMadam Choi vanished first. When Shin went to Hong Kong to investigate, he was attacked and woke up wrapped in plastic sheeting aboard a ship bound for North Korea. Madam Choi lived in isolated luxury, allowed only to attend the Dear LeaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dinner parties. Shin, meanwhile, tried to escape, was sent to prison camp, and &quot;re-educated.&quot; After four years he cracked, pledging loyalty. Reunited with Choi at the first party he attends, it is announced that the couple will remarry and act as the Dear LeaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s film advisors. Together they made seven films, in the process gaining Kim Jong-IlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trust. While pretending to research a film in Vienna, they flee to the U.S. embassy and are swept to safety. \n\nA nonfiction thriller packed with tension, passion, and politics, A Kim Jong-Il Production offers a rare glimpse into a secretive world, illuminating a fascinating chapter of North KoreaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history that helps explain how it became the hermetically sealed, intensely stage-managed country it remains today.\n\nAudio CD\nPublisher: Random House Audio; Unabridged edition (3 February 2015)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1101913185\nISBN-13: 978-1101913185\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
