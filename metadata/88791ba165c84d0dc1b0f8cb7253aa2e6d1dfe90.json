All the while Zizek obsessively reveals the invisible workings of ideology through his unique blend of Lacanian psychoanalysis, Marxism, and critique of pop culture. Never ceasing to observe the paradoxes that underpin our perception of reality, little goes untheorized over the course of the film, particularly Zizek&amp;#039;s recurring themes -- ideology, belief, revolution, and love. But Zizek is also unafraid to turn his critical gaze on himself, astutely analyzing his private life for the camera and contemplating on his conflicted relationship to his growing celebrity.\n\nErudite and outrageous, mixing innovative animations with uncensored interviews, &quot;Zizek!&quot; is both an unforgettable lesson in philosophy and a compelling portrait of an intellectual maverick.\n\n&quot;?izek!&quot; is the second feature length project of the Documentary Campaign, a non-profit working to combine progressive politics with artistic filmmaking, and was made in association with Hidden Driver Productions. Generous support was provided by the Canada Council for the Arts. &quot;Zizek!&quot; premiered at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival and is distributed in North America by Zeitgeist Films.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.zizekthemovie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.zizekthemovie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFile Name.....................: zizek!.avi\nFile Size.....................: 734,179,328 bytes\n\nVideo Codec...................: XviD\nVideo Bitrate.................: 888kbps\nDuration [Frame Count]........: 01:09:29 (hh:mm:ss) [99967]\nResolution [Aspect Ratio].....: 608x352 [1.727]\n(B-VOP), [QPel], &lt;GMC&gt; .......: (B-VOP), [], &lt;&gt;\n\nAudio Codec...................: 0x0055(MP3, ISO) MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate.................: 104kbps VBR\nSample Rate...................: 48000 KhZ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88791ba165c84d0dc1b0f8cb7253aa2e6d1dfe90","amp;dn":"zizek%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88791ba165c84d0dc1b0f8cb7253aa2e6d1dfe90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,121,27,161,101,200,77,13,193,176,248,203,114,83,170,46,109,29,254,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
