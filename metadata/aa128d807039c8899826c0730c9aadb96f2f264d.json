This one is better.\n\nHyperspace is a Pdf and Physics of the Future is an Epub file.\n\nThe New York Times bestselling author of Physics of the Impossible gives us a stunning and provocative vision of the future. Based on interviews with over three hundred of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s top scientists, who are already inventing the future in their labs, KakuÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in a lucid and engaging fashionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½presents the revolutionary developments in medicine, computers, quantum physics, and space travel that will forever change our way of life and alter the course of civilization itself. His astonishing revelations include: -  The Internet will be in your contact lens. It will recognize peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s faces, display their biographies, and even translate their words into subtitles. -  You will control computers and appliances via tiny sensors that pick up your brain scans. You will be able to rearrange the shape of objects. -  Sensors in your clothing, bathroom, and appliances will monitor your vitals, and nanobots will scan your DNA and cells for signs of danger, allowing life expectancy to increase dramatically. -  Radically new spaceships, using laser propulsion, may replace the expensive chemical rockets of today. You may be able to take an elevator hundreds of miles into space by simply pushing the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ button.   Like Physics of the Impossible and Visions before it, Physics of the Future is an exhilarating, wondrous ride through the next one hundred years of breathtaking scientific revolution.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa128d807039c8899826c0730c9aadb96f2f264d","amp;dn":"Michio+Kaku+-+Physics+of+the+Future+%26+Hyperspace","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa128d807039c8899826c0730c9aadb96f2f264d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,18,141,128,112,57,200,137,152,38,192,115,12,154,173,185,111,47,38,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
