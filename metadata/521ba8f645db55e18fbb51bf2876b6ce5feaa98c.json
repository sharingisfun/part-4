Eerily reminiscent of my own bored, suburban teen years, where there was nothing to do except drink alarming amounts of coffee, shop for weird second-hand clothes, and bitch endlessly about high school (openly nicknamed Auschwitz), Ghost World may be the first popular film about the real life of girls. Sure, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Heathers, Welcome to the Dollhouse, and endless other stuff which is supposed to unleash oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inner 15-year-old bitch, but Ghost World really comes the closest for me.\n\nEnid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) graduate from high school and promptly opt out of going to college. Instead, Rebecca spends the summer looking for an apartment and schlepping lattes to losers, freaks and perverts (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbut those are our people!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ exclaims Enid) while Enid develops an interest in Seymore (Steve Buscemi), a local record collector. Forced to attend a remedial art class, (Illeana Douglas has a hilarious minor role as the flaky art teacher, complete with weird hair, purple batik clothing, and bad video art) Enid soon takes her talent for fucking with people to a whole new level when she uses racist advertising from the 1930s as a found art object. Amid the mean-but-funny pranks, Enid also finds time to help Seymore date, while she and Rebecca grow further and further apart. Filled with lines like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGo die, asshole!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOhmigod, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re Satanists!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, Ghost World captures the warmth and bitchiness of real friendship, set against a lurid backdrop of American suburban sprawl. I laughed, I cried, it was better than The Vagina Monologues. \n\nMedia Info:\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : J:\\Seeding\\Ghost World (2001)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢]\\Ghost World (2001)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢].AVI\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 1.43 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 51mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 832 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 51mn\nBit rate                         : 1 499 Kbps\nWidth                            : 716 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.182\nStream size                      : 1.17 GiB (82%)\nWriting library                  : XviD \n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 51mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 255 MiB (17%)\nAlignment                        : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 335 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98\n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.50.1.1100\nwww.malwarebytes.org\n\nDatabase version: 5958\n3/4/2011 8:20:09 PM\nmbam-log-2011-03-04 (20-20-09).txt\n\nScan type: Quick scan\nObjects scanned: 5\nTime elapsed: 22 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nWhen using TPB please read these important notes:\n  \n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n\nRequests?
