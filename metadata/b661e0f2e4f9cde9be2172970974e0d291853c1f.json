Whereas his debut album Bob Dylan had contained only two original songs, FreewheelinÃ¢â‚¬Å 'Ã¢â‚¬â€¹ represented the beginning of Dylan's writing contemporary words to traditional melodies. Eleven of the thirteen songs on the album are Dylan's original compositions. The album opens with &quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot;, which became an anthem of the 1960s, and an international hit for folk trio Peter, Paul &amp; Mary soon after the release of FreewheelinÃ¢â‚¬Å 'Ã¢â‚¬â€¹. The album featured several other songs which came to be regarded as amongst Dylan's best compositions and classics of the 1960s folk scene: &quot;Girl from the North Country&quot;, &quot;Masters of War&quot;, &quot;A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall&quot; and &quot;Don't Think Twice, It's All Right&quot;.\n\nDylan's lyrics embraced stories taken from the headlines about civil rights and he articulated anxieties about the fear of nuclear warfare. Balancing this political material were love songs, sometimes bitter and accusatory, and material that features surreal humor. FreewheelinÃ¢â‚¬Å 'Ã¢â‚¬â€¹ showcased Dylan's songwriting talent for the first time, propelling him to national and international fame. The success of the album and Dylan's subsequent recognition led to his being named as &quot;Spokesman of a Generation,&quot; a label Dylan repudiated.\n\nThe Freewheelin' Bob Dylan reached number 22 in the United States (eventually going platinum), and became a number-one hit in the United Kingdom in 1964. In 2003, the album was ranked number 97 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In 2002, Freewheelin' was one of the first 50 recordings chosen by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:48\n    &quot;Girl from the North Country&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:22\n    &quot;Masters of War&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:34\n    &quot;Down the Highway&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:27\n    &quot;Bob Dylan's Blues&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:23\n    &quot;A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:55\n    &quot;Don't Think Twice, It's All Right&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:40\n    &quot;Bob Dylan's Dream&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:03\n    &quot;Oxford Town&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:50\n    &quot;Talkin' World War III Blues&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:28\n    &quot;Corrina, Corrina&quot; (Traditional) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:44\n    &quot;Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance&quot; (Dylan, Henry Thomas) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:01\n    &quot;I Shall Be Free&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:49","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b661e0f2e4f9cde9be2172970974e0d291853c1f","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+The+Freewheelin%27+Bob+Dylan+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b661e0f2e4f9cde9be2172970974e0d291853c1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,97,224,242,228,249,205,233,190,33,114,151,9,116,224,210,145,133,60,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
