Elmo McElroy (Samuel L. Jackson), a new college graduate with a degree in pharmacology, is caught smoking marijuana when his car is pulled over by a patrolman. His arrest and conviction prevent his employment as a pharmacologist. The film then fast forwards to the present day as a drug lord called &quot;the Lizard&quot; (Meat Loaf) calls a meeting with his organization, hoping to sell a brand new substance invented by McElroy. The meeting goes awry when McElroy, in a bid to escape from the Lizard's control, blows up the building, killing everyone but the Lizard, who falls through the floor. With revenge on his mind, the Lizard contacts Dakota (Emily Mortimer), a contract killer, who in the film's early scenes, killed the only witness in a case against the Lizard. Dakota initially refuses to chase down and kill McElroy, but when the Lizard offers to clear her gambling debts and give her a $250,000 bonus to complete the hit, Dakota takes the job. McElroy heads for Liverpool where he has a deal arranged. At the airport he is met by Felix DeSouza (Robert Carlyle), an ex-hitman who has been sent by his boss Leopold Durant (Ricky Tomlinson), head of a local criminal organization, in exchange for two football tickets to the Liverpool versus Manchester United game.\n\nGenre: Action | Comedy | Crime\n\nRelease date: 7 December 2001 (UK)\n\ncast\n\n# Samuel L.
