Concerned that Starbucks had lost its way, Schultz was determined to help it return to its core values and restore not only its financial health, but also its soul. In Onward, he shares the remarkable story of his return and the company's ongoing transformation under his leadership, revealing how, during one of the most tumultuous economic times in history, Starbucks again achieved profitability and sustainability without sacrificing humanity.\n \nOffering readers a snapshot of a moment in history that left no company unscathed, the book zooms in to show, in riveting detail, how one company struggled and recreated itself in the midst of it all. The fastpaced narrative is driven by day-to-day tension as conflicts arise and lets readers into Schultz's psyche as he comes to terms with his limitations and evolving leadership style. Onward is a compelling, candid narrative documenting the maturing of a brand as well as a businessman.\n \nOnward represents Schultz's central leadership philosophy: It's not just about winning, but the right way to win. Ultimately, he gives readers what he strives to deliver every dayÃ¢â‚¬â€a sense of hope that, no matter how tough times get, the future can be just as or more successful than the past, whatever one defines success to be.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43da3b19a1fda47cf2cb019bb712d3df71acf855","amp;dn":"Onwards+-+How+Starbucks+Fought+for+its+Life+Without+Losing+Its+S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43da3b19a1fda47cf2cb019bb712d3df71acf855","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,218,59,25,161,253,164,124,242,203,1,155,183,18,211,223,113,172,248,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
