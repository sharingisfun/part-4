C. Corbridge\nCRC Press | January 2013 | ISBN-10: 1439840881 | PDF | 1473 pages | 22.9 mb\n\nOver two decades have passed since the fifth edition of Phosphorus: Chemistry, Biochemistry and Technology. Major advances in chemistry, materials science, electronics, and medicine have expanded and clarified the role of phosphorus in both our everyday appliances and groundbreaking research. Significantly expanded, updated, and reorganized, this sixth edition organizes and explains vital phosphorus research and relevant information available in highly specialized reviews and references on select related topics.\n\nAn authoritative and comprehensive review of phosphorus chemistry and related technology, Phosphorus: Chemistry, Biochemistry and Technology covers historical, academic, industrial, agricultural, military, biological, and medical aspects of phosphorous. Furthermore, it offers a starting point for more extended studies of the highly specialized branches of phosphorus chemistry.\n\nAlthough this book deals with a small fraction of the &gt; 106 known phosphorus compounds, it thoroughly covers the simpler derivatives and most key compounds of economic, sociological, and biological importance. Extensively updated and expanded with tables, figures, equations, structural formulae, and references, it is ideal for scientists in related fields seeking a rapid introduction to phosphorus chemistry.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface .... xxxi\nAcknowledgement....xxxiii\nChapter 1)&gt;&gt; Introduction and Historical Background..... 1\nChapter 2)&gt;&gt; Distribution and Environment.... 23\nChapter 3)&gt;&gt; Atomic and Molecular Properties..... 45\nChapter 4)&gt;&gt; Phosphides of Non-Metals..... 93\nChapter 5)&gt;&gt; Oxyphosphorus Compounds.... 177\nChapter 6)&gt;&gt; Carbophosphorus Compounds.... 327\nChapter 7)&gt;&gt; Azaphosphorus Compounds..... 497\nChapter 8)&gt;&gt; Metallophosphorus Compounds.... 593\nChapter 9)&gt;&gt; Compounds with p-Block Elements..... 709\nChapter 10)&gt;&gt; Biopolymers and Phospho-Bioassemblies.... 829\nChapter 11)&gt;&gt; Biophosphorus Chemistry..... 921\nChapter 12)&gt;&gt; Applications of Phosphorus Compounds.... 1021\nChapter 13)&gt;&gt; Special Topics.... 1245\nChapter 14)&gt;&gt; Analysis and Characterisation.... 1329\nAppendix 1: Atomic Data for the Elements ... 1365\nAppendix 2: Hazards of Phosphorus Compounds ... 1369\nAppendix 3: Properties of White Phosphorus, P4 ... 1373\nAppendix 4: Properties of Ã¢â‚¬ËœRedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Phosphorus, Pn ... 1375\nAppendix 5: Properties of Phosphine, PH3 ... 1377\nAppendix 6: Properties of Orthophosphoric Acid, H3PO4 ... 1379\nAppendix 7: Abbreviations and Symbols ... 1381\nAppendix 8: Conversion Factors ... 1391","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c2dc8f9c20eeb8c643cbf4a59a9a7c597f30a71","amp;dn":"Phosphorus+-+Chemistry%2C+Biochemistry+and+Technology+%286th+Ed%29%28gnv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c2dc8f9c20eeb8c643cbf4a59a9a7c597f30a71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,45,200,249,194,14,235,140,100,60,191,74,89,169,167,197,151,243,10,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
