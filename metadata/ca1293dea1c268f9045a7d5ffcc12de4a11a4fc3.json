His good friend Dr. Demento has noted that Fahey &quot;was the first to demonstrate that the finger-picking techniques of traditional country and blues steel-string guitar could be used to express a world of non-traditional musical ideas ? harmonies and melodies you'd associate with Bartok, Charles Ives, or maybe the music of India.&quot; The more meditative aspects of his work foreshadowed new age music, yet Fahey played with a fierce imagination and versatility that outshone any of the guitarists in that category. His idiosyncrasy may have limited him to a cult following, but it also ensured that his work continues to sound fresh.\n\n1963 DEATH CHANTS, BREAKDOWNS, &amp; MILITARY WALTZES\n1964(&amp;59&amp;67) BLIND JOE DEATH\n1965 DANCE OF DEATH &amp; OTHER PLANTATION FAVORITES\n1965 TRANSFIGURATION OF BLIND JOE DEATH\n1966 GREAT SAN BERNARDINO BIRTHDAY\n1967 DAYS HAVE GONE BY\n1968 VOICE OF THE TURTLE\n1971 AMERICA\n1996 Womblife\n1998 Georgia Stomps, Atlanta Struts\nJohn Fahey.doc\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca1293dea1c268f9045a7d5ffcc12de4a11a4fc3","amp;dn":"John+Fahey+%288+Albums+63-71%2C+2+Albums+96-98%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca1293dea1c268f9045a7d5ffcc12de4a11a4fc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,18,147,222,161,194,104,249,4,90,125,95,252,193,45,228,161,26,79,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
