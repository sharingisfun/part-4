NobodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perfect. Not even some of the greatest geniuses in history, as Mario Livio tells us in this marvelous story of scientific error and breakthrough.\n\nCharles Darwin, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), Linus Pauling, Fred Hoyle, and Albert Einstein were all brilliant scientists. Each made groundbreaking contributions to his fieldÃ¢â‚¬â€but each also stumbled badly. DarwinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theory of natural selection shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have worked, according to the prevailing beliefs of his time. Not until Gregor MendelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work was known would there be a mechanism to explain natural selection. How could Darwin be both wrong and right? Lord Kelvin, BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading scientific intellect at the time, gravely miscalculated the age of the earth. Linus Pauling, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s premier chemist (who would win the Nobel Prize in chemistry) constructed an erroneous model for DNA in his haste to beat the competition to publication.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e9e5328f2132f8796b6e0cc16c8ea3cade10141","amp;dn":"Brilliant+Blunders%3A+From+Darwin+to+Einstein+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e9e5328f2132f8796b6e0cc16c8ea3cade10141","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,158,83,40,242,19,47,135,150,182,224,204,22,200,234,60,173,225,1,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
