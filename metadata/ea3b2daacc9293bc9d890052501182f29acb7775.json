Hence this film has been seen as a metaphor for the sense of civil duty, about loyalty and everyday heroics. The traditional beliefs of Iranian rural people are also shown in many parts of the movie.\n\nIMDb RATING: 7.9/10 (1,266 votes)\n\nTOP 10 - BFI LIST OF THE 50 FILMS YOU SHOULD SEE BY THE AGE OF 14\n\nRuntime.......: 79 min\nVideo.........: 576x368 (1.57:1), 25 fps, XviD Final 1.0.2 (build 36) ~1133 kbps avg, 0.21 bit/pixel\nAudio.........: 48 kHz, MPEG Layer 3, 2 ch, ~81.14 kbps avg\nSubtitles.....: English\n\ncredit GALA BIG BIG BIG TIME &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone\n\n*****help what we can with haiti or any other in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea3b2daacc9293bc9d890052501182f29acb7775","amp;dn":"Where+is+the+Friends+Home+%281987%29+ENG+SUBS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea3b2daacc9293bc9d890052501182f29acb7775","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,59,45,170,204,146,147,188,157,137,0,82,80,17,130,242,154,203,119,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
