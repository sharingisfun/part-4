Inspired by classics from the golden age of couch multiplayer, it's a 4-player local party game centering around hilarious, intense versus matches. The core mechanics are simple and accessible, but hard to master and combat is fierce. Loot treasure chests for game-changing power-ups, master the art of catching arrows out of the air, or descend on your foes and stomp them into submission. TowerFall is best played competitively with friends, cross-legged on the floor within punching distance of each other.\r\n\r\nNew in Ascension is the 1- or 2-player co-op Quest mode. Players work together, fighting off a variety of monsters and enemy archers across the land of TowerFall. It's a new adventure to explore when you don't have more friends handy to square off against","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d044dee266381006cd1f21292899f01c2984623","amp;dn":"TowerFall+Ascension+v1.3.3+Incl+ALL+DLC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d044dee266381006cd1f21292899f01c2984623","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,4,77,238,38,99,129,0,108,209,242,18,146,137,159,1,194,152,70,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
