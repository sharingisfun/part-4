Godet\n\n\nTitle: Take My Breath Away \nArtist: Gui Boratto\nStore Date: 5 mar 2009 (Brasil) - 23 mar 2009 (Europe)\nUpload Date: 01 feb 2009\nLabel: Kompakt\nGenre: tech house\nCover: front\nBitrate: 192 kb/s, joint stereo\n\n\nBrazilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Gui Boratto elegantly introduced clubland to his unique world of dreamy melodic techno in 2007 with his debut Chromophobia.\nThe LPs melancholy, high production aesthetic, and electro-pop sensibilities (Beautiful Life was one of the biggest sing-a-long anthems of that year) made Gui a star around the world. \nFrom the start, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s clear Take My Breath Away is destined both for dancefloors and home stereos with the tracklist split roughly down the middle between BorattoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s standard (and excellent) deep techno tracks and cute electro pop numbers. \nDriving techno fans will lap up Ballroom and Atomic Soda, electro aficionados might dig Eggplant, and Take My Breath Away and Opus will please those who like their techno to burn as slow as a candle.\nColors, Azzurra and Les Enfants showcases Gui BorattoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s calmer and more joyful side by featuring broken beats, electric guitars and live drums.\nAnd fans of the hugely popular Beautiful Life might get their euphoria fix from the vocals on No Turning Back.\nOverall Take My Breath Away is an accomplished continuation of Gui BorattoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s colourful melodies.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ead219b380b2d77000c512d07bd900aae3bd82c5","amp;dn":"Gui+Boratto+-+Take+My+Breath+Away+%5Bpromo-mp3-192-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ead219b380b2d77000c512d07bd900aae3bd82c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,210,25,179,128,178,215,112,0,197,18,208,123,217,0,170,227,189,130,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
