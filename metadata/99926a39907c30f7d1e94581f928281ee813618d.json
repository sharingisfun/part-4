Now, Matthew Hutson shows us that even the most hardcore skeptic indulges in magical thinking all the time-and it's crucial to our survival.\n\nDrawing on evolution, cognitive science, and neuroscience, Hutson shows us that magical thinking has been so useful to us that it's hardwired into our brains. It encourages us to think that we actually have free will. It helps make us believe that we have an underlying purpose in the world. It can even protect us from the paralyzing awareness of our own mortality. In other words, magical thinking is a completely irrational way of making our lives make rational sense.\n\nWith wonderfully entertaining stories, personal reflections, and sharp observations, Hutson reveals our deepest fears and longings. He also assures us that it is no accident his surname contains so many of the same letters as this imprint.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99926a39907c30f7d1e94581f928281ee813618d","amp;dn":"7+Laws+of+Magical+Thinking+-+Matthew+Hutson.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99926a39907c30f7d1e94581f928281ee813618d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,146,106,57,144,124,48,247,209,233,69,129,249,40,40,30,232,19,97,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
