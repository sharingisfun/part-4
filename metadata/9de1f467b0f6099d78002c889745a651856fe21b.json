Formed in 1994, they are signed to Warner Bros. Records and have released five albums, their most recent being Cannibal, which was released on April 3, 2007.\n\nThe band rose to fame with their debut album Wisconsin Death Trip, which went platinum in 2001. However, this is the only album they have released to date that has reached such sales level. Their sound incorporates elements of industrial music and heavy metal in a sub-genre called industrial metal. Static-X often refer to themselves as &quot;Evil Disco&quot;.\n\n\n\n=================================================================\nArtist    -  Static-X       \nAlbum     -  various                                          \nGenre     -  industrial metal                                              \nLabel     -  Warner Bros.\nYear      -  1994-2008                                            \nTracks    -  n/a                                               \nPlaytime  -  n/a\nFile Type -  .mp3\nSize      -  457.49 MB\nkbps      -  VBR / 256 avg &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy.
