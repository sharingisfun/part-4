The trepidation that proceeds battle can be found in the depth of Hells Deep Sub Boomz echo the warmth of a call that inspired the timid long ago.

War Ensemble is reminiscent of grand, prehistoric armies that stormed across a rugged landscape, terrorizing all in their wake. Titan Ensemble can help to evoke the courage of battle-weary soldiers or the fear of the death knells call.\n\nPristine 24/96k Recordings at the legendary Manhattan Center Studios\nUnprocessed natural cinematic sonic quality\n100% Natural Reverberation\nLive Ensemble Playing\nExtensive 5 Dynamic Layer Patches each using Level based Round Robin programming\nTruly Random Round Robin Scripting*\nQuick EQ GUI using pre-selected frequencies for quick and accurate equalization\nAlternate Takes Included (Up to RR X13)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56975632111d8d32674dbfe1f530b4619c360630","amp;dn":"CineSamples+-+Drums+Of+War+%5BKONTAKT%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56975632111d8d32674dbfe1f530b4619c360630","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,151,86,50,17,29,141,50,103,77,191,225,245,48,180,97,156,54,6,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
