Having himself planted the seeds of the Twelve legend, Apocalypse hopes to siphon their power, granting him omnipotence. Desperate to stave off his ascension, the X-Men must strike a temporary truce with Magneto to battle the warlord's forces as the Twelve are assembled - and one longtime member seemingly sacrifices his own life to end the threat of Apocalypse once and for all! &quot;\n\nThis is the whole storyline complied by Kritter-DCP into this one-volume Archive Edition.
