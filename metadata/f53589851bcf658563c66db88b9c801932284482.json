To accomplish that task, each kid is given a magic ring that each has a power of earth, wind, water, fire and heart. When the threat they face is too big for them to face, they can combine and amplify their powers to create Captain Planet, who has the power to stop catastrophic environmental disasters himself, while the Planeteers contribute with the things anyone can and should do to help.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f53589851bcf658563c66db88b9c801932284482","amp;dn":"Captain+Planet+%28ALL+113+Episodes%29+complete+All+seasons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f53589851bcf658563c66db88b9c801932284482","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,53,137,133,27,207,101,133,99,198,109,184,139,156,128,25,50,40,68,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
