Although the main focus of the text is on corporations, several alternative forms of business organizations are featured. Because the law of corporations and business organizations is based largely on state law, the discussions in this book focus on the Uniform and Model Laws used by most state legislatures when adopting their own state laws. Special attention is given to the Model Business Corporation Act 2007, published in February 2008, which is drafted by the Section of Business Law, American Bar Association. Discussions concerning partnerships and the limited liability entities focus on the Uniform Partnership Acts, Uniform Limited Partnership Acts, and Uniform Limited Liability Company Acts drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. Each chapter includes an in-depth discussion of the law, with charts indicating the pertinent sections of state law where applicable. Examples, sample documents and paragraphs, and practical advice are included for the paralegal student. Interesting cases are included for discussion purposes wherever possible. These cases have been edited liberally to a reasonable length, and to cut out discussion that is not relevant to the topic at hand. Several charts, tables, and graphs are dispersed throughout to summarize important points and to add visual appeal. Sidebars with interesting facts and statistics are also included to help keep the students' interest. Each chapter includes a Resources section complete with online resources with URLs, as well as reference to the Online Companion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04bebbd7e65490ce4b473e40d2ea06a70a5b14f9","amp;dn":"Law+of+Corporations+and+Other+Business+Organizations+5th+edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04bebbd7e65490ce4b473e40d2ea06a70a5b14f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,190,187,215,230,84,144,206,75,71,62,64,210,234,6,167,10,91,20,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
