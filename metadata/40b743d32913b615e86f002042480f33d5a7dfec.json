To say that Kenny G has found himself a niche in our musical landscape would be a pretty serious understatement. He has built a monumental career by catering to the needs of a healthy portion of the record-buying public--music that soothes the soul, warms the heart and, perhaps most important, places no undue stress on the brain. THE MOMENT, Kenny G's ninth release, continues the trend--Mr. G. is no fool. Nor is he a slouch on the soprano saxophone. His inspired soloing on the aptly-named, Latin-tinged Havana, the clean funk of Eastside Jam and the high drama of &quot;The Champions Theme&quot; demonstrate his strengths as a musician who understands the importance of melody and line better than many singers. But not all singers. Toni Braxton and Babyface do guest spots on THE MOMENT, and they fit in beautifully. Braxton makes a characteristically sexy contribution to That Somebody Was You. The lusciously smooth Everytime I Close My Eyes gets the full Babyface treatment, which, as most R&amp;B aficionados will tell you, makes for a pretty special track. So special, in fact, that Babyface includes it on his own latest release, THE DAY. Saxophone master Kenny G's seventh studio album was originally released in 1996 and reached #1 on the Billboard Top Contemporary Jazz Albums chart, #2 on the Billboard 200, and #9 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.&quot;...Not only does [THE MOMENT] emphasize mood over momentum and tenderness over tension, but it wraps each engaging melody in arrangments that seem soft no matter how high the volume....elevates background music to a minor art form.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40b743d32913b615e86f002042480f33d5a7dfec","amp;dn":"Kenny+G+-+The+Moment+%5BFlac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40b743d32913b615e86f002042480f33d5a7dfec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,183,67,211,41,19,182,21,232,111,0,32,66,72,15,51,213,167,223,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
