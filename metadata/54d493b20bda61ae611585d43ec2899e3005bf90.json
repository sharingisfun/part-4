It was recorded live in England for the MTV Unplugged series and includes both the hit single &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; and a heavily reworked acoustic version of &quot;Layla&quot;.\n\nClapton performed the show in front of a small audience on 16 January 1992 at Bray Film Studios in Windsor, England. In addition to the final album tracks, the performance included early versions of &quot;My Father's Eyes&quot; and &quot;Circus Left Town&quot; along with &quot;Worried Life Blues&quot; and a version of &quot;Rollin' and Tumblin'&quot;. Clapton played a Martin 000-42 acoustic guitar for much of this performance, and in 2004, the guitar sold for US$791,500 (Ã‚Â£434,400) in auction. \n\nOn October 15, 2013 the album was re-released, titled Unplugged: Expanded &amp; Remastered. The album includes the original 14 tracks, remastered, as well as six additional tracks, including two versions of &quot;My Father's Eyes&quot;.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Signe&quot; (Eric Clapton) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:13 (2:17)\n    &quot;Before You Accuse Me&quot; (Ellas McDaniel) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:36\n    &quot;Hey Hey&quot; (Big Bill Broonzy) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:24\n    &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; (Clapton, Will Jennings) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:34\n    &quot;Lonely Stranger&quot; (Clapton) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:28\n    &quot;Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out&quot; (Jimmy Cox) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:49\n    &quot;Layla&quot; (Clapton, Jim Gordon) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:46\n    &quot;Running on Faith&quot; (Jerry Lynn Williams) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:35\n    &quot;Walkin' Blues&quot; (Robert Johnson) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:37\n    &quot;Alberta&quot; (Traditional) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:42\n    &quot;San Francisco Bay Blues&quot; (Jesse Fuller) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:23\n    &quot;Malted Milk&quot; (Robert Johnson) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:36\n    &quot;Old Love&quot; (Clapton, Robert Cray) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:53\n    &quot;Rollin' and Tumblin'&quot; (Muddy Waters) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:10\n\nDeluxe Edition Disc 2\n\n    &quot;Circus&quot;\n    &quot;My Fathers Eyes [Take 1]&quot;\n    &quot;Running On Faith [Take 1]\n    &quot;Walkin' Blues [Take 1]\n    &quot;My Fathers Eyes [Take 2]&quot;\n    &quot;Worried Life Blues&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54d493b20bda61ae611585d43ec2899e3005bf90","amp;dn":"Eric+Clapton+-+Unplugged+%5BDELUXE%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54d493b20bda61ae611585d43ec2899e3005bf90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,212,147,178,11,218,97,174,97,21,133,212,62,194,137,158,48,5,191,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
