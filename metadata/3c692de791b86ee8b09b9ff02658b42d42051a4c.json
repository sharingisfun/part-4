Richard plays Don, a mechanic who, with three friends, is preparing to launch an offbeat European continental travel service using an old London double-decker bus. On a test run, they collide with a car occupied by a group of female rock musicians, demolishing it -- so they offer to give the girls a ride to Athens. They also pick up an American pop singer, Barbara (Lauri Peters), who is posing as a boy to hide from her press agent and mother, who refuse to allow her a vacation from a demanding tour schedule. Don and Barbara fall in love, but Barbara's mother accuses him of abducting her, and the bus and the music roll on to Greece after a series of comic misadventures. The cast includes the real rock group The Shadows. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057541/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057541/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:43:38\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 512x384 4/3\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1698 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,35 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 192 Kbps\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c692de791b86ee8b09b9ff02658b42d42051a4c","amp;dn":"Summer+Holiday+%28Cliff+Richard+-+1962+Eng%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c692de791b86ee8b09b9ff02658b42d42051a4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,105,45,231,145,184,110,232,176,155,159,240,38,88,180,45,66,5,26,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
