In addition to practical observations and tips on such topics as creating a weekly schedule, staging parts and tools, and daily scheduling, this second edition features a greatly expanded CMMS appendix which includes discussion of critical cautions for implementation, patches, major upgrades, testing, training, and interfaces with other company software.
