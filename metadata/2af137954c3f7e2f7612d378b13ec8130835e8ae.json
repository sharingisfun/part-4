Not sure why it wasn't showing up properly before, but it seems to be fine now]\n\nThese aren't HD or anything fancy.\nAll episodes were collected right here from TPB.\n\nThe reason I've re-upped is because I've cleaned filenames, metadata tags, and done volume levelling across all files.  I had to convert some that were mp4 format into avi for consistency and to help with volume-levelling.\n\nI'll bet you can find higher-resolution rips if you dig, but I can pretty much promise you these will be much better organized and much less of a hassle to sort through.\n\nI recommend VLC for viewing.\nIf you insist on using WMP, make sure you get the K-Lite Media Codec packs first.\nK-Lite is freeware and it's basically an essential part of any video lover's toolkit.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2af137954c3f7e2f7612d378b13ec8130835e8ae","amp;dn":"Top+Gear+US+-+Season+1+%28FIXED%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2af137954c3f7e2f7612d378b13ec8130835e8ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,241,55,149,76,63,126,47,118,18,211,120,177,62,200,19,8,53,232,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
