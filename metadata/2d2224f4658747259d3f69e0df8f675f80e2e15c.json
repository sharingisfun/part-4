You will end up being more positive and finding more positive opportunities in your life. Sorry, you'll just have to live with that!\n\nDevelop a yes mindset so that no matter how bleak the situation may look, you have the best chance of anyone to find something that will rescue the moment.\n\nDo you have a BIG favour to ask? No problem - Igor will show you how to build up to it step by step using the loaded frames hidden inside the innocent sounding YES! Decks.\n\nHow to get people to do more than say YES! to you - using the loaded frames in the YES! Decks they will be so PASSIONATE about your proposal that they will tell the world about you and convince them to come and listen to you!\n\nHow to use the salami tactic in order to get people to agree even to massive commitments.\n\nHave people enthusiastically buy into your product, services or ideas - and be so keen they actually want to persuade OTHERS about how good your idea was!\n\nThe secret to the psychology of rejection and how to turn it on its head so it never again happens to you!\n\nMake rejection a thing of the past - now you can predict exactly who is ready to say yes... but if they aren't there yet, NO PROBLEM - simply follow Igor's 4 Step Persuasion Formula and eventually they won't be able to help themselves, they'll end up begging you to give them a something to say yes to!\n\nBecome such a positive person that people will flock to you and BEG you to influence them further - because it just feels so good to them when you do it!\n\nHow to become a genuine force for good in your community, someone that's a positive force in the lives of all those around him AND gets their respect and admiration for doing so - its so easy with the mindset the YES! Decks instil in you, you'll kick yourself for not starting sooner!\n\nAnd much much more (that's just a small sample afterall...)\nSo What's In This Package For You?\n\n2 Decks of Cards\n\n105 Cards In Total (50 Yes! cards in each deck and 5 special modifiers)\n\n7 CDs of Instruction &amp; Training So You Can Use Them To Maximum Effect\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d2224f4658747259d3f69e0df8f675f80e2e15c","amp;dn":"Igor+Ledochowski+-+The+Yes+Decks+%5B7+CDs+-+MP3s%2C+12+PDFs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d2224f4658747259d3f69e0df8f675f80e2e15c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,34,36,244,101,135,71,37,157,63,105,224,223,143,103,95,128,226,225,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
