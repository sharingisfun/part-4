These applets allow you to have a much richer experience online than simply interacting with static HTML pages.\n\nJava Plug-in technology, included as part of the Java 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (JRE), establishes a connection between popular browsers and the Java platform. Java allows applications to be downloaded over a network and run within a guarded sandbox. Security restrictions are easily imposed on the sandbox.\n\nMany cross platform applications also require Java to operate properly.\n\nTechnical:-\n\nTitle:Java Runtime Environment 1.7.0.1 (32-bit)\n\nFilename:jre-7u1-windows-i586.exe\n\nFile size:19.26MB (20,197,256 bytes)\n\nRequirements:Windows XP / 2003 / Vista / Windows7\n\nLanguages:en-US\n\nLicense: Freeware\n\nDate added:October 19, 2011\n\nAuthor:Oracle\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:087ccb3f8607a46c98fbbb152307ae9058574dbe","amp;dn":"Java+Runtime+Environment+1.7.0.1+%2832-bit%29+-+CRANK+-+Team+MJY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"087ccb3f8607a46c98fbbb152307ae9058574dbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,124,203,63,134,7,164,108,152,251,187,21,35,7,174,144,88,87,77,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
