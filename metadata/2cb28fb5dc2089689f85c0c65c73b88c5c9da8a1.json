Flawless heart-breakingly realistic performances all round (Ralph Fiennes makes a chilling boss, even with the few lines he has), great hilarious set-ups (won't reveal too much, but one of the best ones involves Slade, and a certain well-known children's TV character), and a heartwarming message about family, friendship and wanting more out of life (themes perfected by Gervais and Merchant with The Office and Extras). It provides situations and gags that sound relatively unoriginal on paper, but become something new entirely on screen. It has a real heart, genuine emotion, genius humour, and showcases what makes good old-fashioned British dramas the best.\n\nHowever, I fear those seeking a stupid comedy like The Hangover or Cop Out (where ridiculous unrealistic characters say random things desperate for laughs) will probably be disappointed. If it's cheap laughs you want from Ricky Gervais, watch The Invention of Lying (God help you)! I'm also not sure how well this film will sit with American audiences (the humour is downplayed and very British)\n\nIn short, a fantastic film for those who appreciate British comedy dramas in the vein of The Full Monty or East is East. Also, watch out for bald-headed Manc Karl Pilkington's 1 second cameo! Classic stuff! \n\n\nSCREENS (Remove 'x' from link)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i29.tinypic.xcom/2r4khdx.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i29.tinypic.xcom/2r4khdx.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOR:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i27.tinypic.xcom/9kryp0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i27.tinypic.xcom/9kryp0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i32.tinypic.xcom/24x2eqs.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i32.tinypic.xcom/24x2eqs.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i25.tinypic.xcom/112a72h.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i25.tinypic.xcom/112a72h.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPLEASE COMMENT, SEED AND BE PATIENT - MY UPLOAD SPEED IS CAPPED AT 40kbps!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cb28fb5dc2089689f85c0c65c73b88c5c9da8a1","amp;dn":"Cemetery+Junction+2010+DVDRip+XviD+AC3-Rx+%28800mb%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cb28fb5dc2089689f85c0c65c73b88c5c9da8a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,178,143,181,220,32,137,104,159,133,192,198,92,115,184,140,92,157,168,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
