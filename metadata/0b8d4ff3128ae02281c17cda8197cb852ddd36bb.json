This is simply a compressed version of the image, I have tested it on a Verbatim 16x dvd-r using alcohol 120 at MAX SPEED with the playstation 2 settings in the image copy. I cannot take credit for the rip, as I obtained it from Isohunt, but the file was not compressed, and doing so shrunk the size in half or so. If you like it, please buy the newer games in the series from Atlus; they are even better and are very reasonably priced (20-30$ for persona 3 WITH A HARDCOVER ART BOOK, SOUNDTRACK CD AND GAME) on amazon, and about 40$ for Persona 4. I am also going to upload Digital Devil Saga, another out of print game.\nPersona 3 purchase link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Persona-FES-Soundtrack-Artbook-Playstation-2/dp/B001G0MG8W/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1229790989&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Persona-FES-Soundtrack-Artbook-Playstation-2/dp/B001G0MG8W/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1229790989&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;\nPersona 4 purchase link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Shin-Megami-Tensei-Persona-Playstation-2/dp/B001C6GVI6/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1229790989&amp;sr=8-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Shin-Megami-Tensei-Persona-Playstation-2/dp/B001C6GVI6/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1229790989&amp;sr=8-2&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease seed, and don't be a jerk.
