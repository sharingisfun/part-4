In the picture, Lena portrays a political activist in search of her own identity. A participant in liberal causes, she interviews people on the streets of Stockholm and asks them about Sweden's class structure, the U. S. position in Vietnam, and the teachings of Martin Luther King, Jr. At home she treats her father with contempt because of his brief dedication to Franco's Loyalists, and she turns her room into an institute filled with radical literature. In both the film and in her private life, Lena has a passionate affair with the actor, BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rje. After their initial sexual encounter, Lena makes up a file on him and then has intercourse with him on a balustrade facing the Royal Palace, in the branches of trees, and in the middle of a country pond. Discovering that BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rje has a mistress and a child, Lena quarrels with him and retreats to practice yoga. Though BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rje follows and makes love to her, Lena flies into a rage when she learns that he is still having affairs with other women. Following a nightmare in which she guns down her former lovers and then shoots and castrates BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rje, Lena hysterically destroys all the files in her room. Recognizing that her advocacy of nonviolence is hypocritical, Lena forsakes her political activities; at the same time, a radio broadcasts an announcement that the Swedish Parliament has endorsed nonviolence. In the final scene of the film, Lena and BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rje's romance ends as they are brought to a Stockholm disinfectant clinic and scrubbed. Lena terminates her liaison with the director when she sees him flirting with another actress.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51a4273339326b9c7d129435184d69a21e359918","amp;dn":"I.am.a.Curious.Yellow.1967.XviD.DVDRip.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51a4273339326b9c7d129435184d69a21e359918","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,164,39,51,57,50,107,156,125,18,148,53,24,77,105,162,30,53,153,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
