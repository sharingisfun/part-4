He shows that the scientists of ancient and medieval times not only did not understand what we understand about the worldÃ¢â‚¬â€they did not understand what there is to understand, or how to understand it. Yet over the centuries, through the struggle to solve such mysteries as the curious backward movement of the planets and the rise and fall of the tides, the modern discipline of science eventually emerged. Along the way, Weinberg examines historic clashes and collaborations between science and the competing spheres of religion, technology, poetry, mathematics, and philosophy.\n\nAn illuminating exploration of the way we consider and analyze the world around us, To Explain the World is a sweeping, ambitious account of how difficult it was to discover the goals and methods of modern science, and the impact of this discovery on human knowledge and development.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8bdaf53840b304a9823f823b923ca8029a4b084","amp;dn":"The+Discovery+of+Science++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8bdaf53840b304a9823f823b923ca8029a4b084","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,189,175,83,132,11,48,74,152,35,248,35,185,35,202,128,41,164,176,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
