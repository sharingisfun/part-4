The 2D top-down view gives you a great overview of what's happening at any given moment, allowing you to be a real criminal mastermind. Features hand-drawn 2D graphics and fun group control until someone calls the cops and everything goes haywire.\n\nDuring the game you'll need to manage your crew from heist to heist by hiring the right goons, and by making sure they are properly equipped. Of course, keeping the goons alive and getting the biggest loot from each heist is a big part of being a true mastermind.\n\nThe Masterplan is currently in Early Access. While the game is already fully playable, with over a dozen of unique heists and a persisting career mode, it is still under development and we will be updating the game regularly. See the Early Access FAQ or the forums for more information. We also hope to get your questions and feedback on our Steam Forums, where we participate frequently","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ab664e593c9d63009d6d7f24ab9f1908fbca786","amp;dn":"The+Masterplan+v1.1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ab664e593c9d63009d6d7f24ab9f1908fbca786","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,182,100,229,147,201,214,48,9,214,215,242,74,185,241,144,143,188,167,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
