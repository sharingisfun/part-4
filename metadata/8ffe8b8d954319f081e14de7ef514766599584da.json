Why let ISPs cap your bandwidth? Use Google's cloud-based Compute Engine to buy as much computing power as you need, when you need it, and for only as long as you need it. In this course, author Joseph Lowery shows how Compute Engine fits within the Google framework, and steps through project development in Compute Engine with two languages (JavaScript and Python), demonstrating how Google's virtual machines are managed programmatically. He also shows you how to coordinate resources and perform mission-critical tasks like load balancing.\nTopics include:\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tIntegrating with Google Cloud products\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tSetting up the Google Cloud SDK\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tCreating a Compute Engine instance\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tAuthenticating users\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tDeveloping with JavaScript and Compute Engine\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tWorking with Python and Compute Engine\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tManaging resources\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tImplementing network load balancing\n\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ffe8b8d954319f081e14de7ef514766599584da","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Google+Cloud+Compute+Engine+Essential+Training+with+Jose","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ffe8b8d954319f081e14de7ef514766599584da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,254,139,141,149,67,25,240,129,225,77,231,239,81,71,102,89,149,132,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
