In 1984, German filmmaker Philip GrÃƒÂ¶ning wrote to the Carthusian order for permission to make a documentary about them. They said they would get back to him. Sixteen years later, they were ready. GrÃƒÂ¶ning, sans crew or artificial lighting, lived in the monks? quarters for six months?filming their daily prayers, tasks, rituals and rare outdoor excursions.\n\nThis transcendent, closely observed film seeks to embody a monastery, rather than simply depict one?it has no score, no voiceover and no archival footage. What remains is stunningly elemental: time, space and light. One of the most mesmerizing and poetic chronicles of spirituality ever created, INTO GREAT SILENCE dissolves the border between screen and audience with a total immersion into the hush of monastic life. More meditation than documentary, it?s a rare, transformative theatrical experience for all.\n\nFilm Info: GroÃƒÅ¸e Stille, Die (2005) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478160/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478160/&lt;/a&gt;\n2006\n162 mins\nColor\nGermany\nEnglish subtitled French dialogue\n35mm\n\nName.........................: INTO GREAT SILENCE\nLength.......................: 02h 41m 44s \n\nResolution...................: 768 x 432\nColorDepth...................: 24 bit\nFramerate....................: 29.970 Frames/Sec\nCodec........................: XviD, 2 Pass mode\nBitrate......................: Avg. 900 kBit/s\n\n[Audio]\nLanguage.....................: German [2 channels] AC3\nFormat.......................: MP3\nChannels.....................: 2 Channels (Surround Stereo)\nBitrate......................: 192 kBit/s\n\nEnjoy!
