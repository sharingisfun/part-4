The National Endowment for the Arts honored Sarah Vaughan with its highest honor in jazz, the NEA Jazz Masters Award in 1989.\n\nSarah Vaughan's contribution to the female jazz vocal genre, during the twentieth century, puts her alongside the likes of Dinah Washington, Billie Holliday and Ella Fitzgerald.\n\nAs a child Sarah Vaughan sang in church and had extensive piano lessons from 1931-39, which helped her become a capable keyboardist.\n\nAfter she won an amateur contest at the Apollo Theatre, she was hired for the Earl Hines big band as a singer and second vocalist.\n\nUnfortunately, the musicians' recording strike kept her off record during this period (1943-44).\n\nWhen lifelong friend Billy Eckstine broke away to form his own orchestra, Vaughan joined him, making her recording debut.\n\nShe enjoyed her time with Eckstine's orchestra, where she became influenced by a couple of his sidemen, Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, both of whom had also been with Hines during her stint.\n\nSarah Vaughn - Sophisticated Lady Tracks:\n01 When Your Lover Has Gone\n02 Misty\n03 The Nearness of You\n04 Sophisticated Lady\n05 Star Eyes\n06 I Remember You\n07 When Sunny Gets Blue\n08 'Round Midnight\n09 It Might as Well Be Spring\n10 The Lord's Prayer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78623a0135f5b209ed8864e6d58f4bbcb382931e","amp;dn":"Sarah+Vaughn+-+Sophisticated+Lady+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78623a0135f5b209ed8864e6d58f4bbcb382931e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,98,58,1,53,245,178,9,237,136,100,230,213,143,75,188,179,130,147,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
