It&amp;#039;s invested with an uncommon complexity and candor that has noticeably faded in his later material. Armed with clever phrasing and sly deadpan wit, Jay-Z navigates indulgent romps (&quot;Can&amp;#039;t Knock the Hustle&quot;), thought-provoking introspection (&quot;Regrets&quot;), and devastating street-corner soliloquies (&quot;Friend or Foe&quot;) with savvy composure. The beats on Reasonable Doubt, provided by the likes of DJ Premier &amp; Ski, are as irresistibly slick as his persona. &quot;Brooklyn&amp;#039;s Finest,&quot; his mic-passing session with his friend Notorious B.I.G., takes on a torch-passing significance in the wake of Biggie&amp;#039;s death. That song, and the entire album, foreshadows Jay-Z&amp;#039;s subsequent ascension to kingpin status. --Del. F. Cowie\n\n\n1. Can&amp;#039;t Knock The Hustle \tListen\n2.
