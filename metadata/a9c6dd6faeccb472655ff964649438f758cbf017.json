Posamentier &amp; Ingmar Lehmann \nCategory: Academic\nPublisher: Prometheus Books (August 31, 2004)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1591022002\nISBN-13: 978-1591022008\n\nPromotional info/Publisher's summary - &quot;We all learned that the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter is called pi and that the value of this algebraic symbol is roughly 3.14. What we weren't told, though, is that behind this seemingly mundane fact is a world of mystery, which has fascinated mathematicians from ancient times to the present. Simply put, pi is weird. Mathematicians call it a &quot;transcendental number&quot; because its value cannot be calculated by any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square root extraction. \n\nIn this delightful layperson's introduction to one of math's most interesting phenomena, Drs. Posamentier and Lehmann review pi's history from prebiblical times to the 21st century, the many amusing and mind-boggling ways of estimating pi over the centuries, quirky examples of obsessing about pi (including an attempt to legislate its exact value), and useful applications of pi in everyday life, including statistics.\n\nThis enlightening and stimulating approach to mathematics will entertain lay readers while improving their mathematical literacy.&quot;\n\nReviews:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I enjoyed reading the bookÃ¢â‚¬Â¦for its many applications, curiosities, and anecdotes.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ -Science Magazine\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Readers curious about pi could start hereÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Recommended.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ -Choice Magazine\n\nThis torrent contains a scanned PDF copy, which is a little better than many of the versions of this book out there and highly readable.
