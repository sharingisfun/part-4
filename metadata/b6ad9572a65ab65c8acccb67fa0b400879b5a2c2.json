Increased coverage of agile methods and software reuse, along with coverage of 'traditional' plan-driven software engineering, gives readers the most up-to-date view of the field currently available. Practical case studies, a full set of easy-to-access supplements, and extensive web resources make teaching the course easier than ever.\n\nThe book is now structured into four parts:\n\n1: Introduction to Software Engineering\n2: Dependability and Security\n3: Advanced Software Engineering\n4: Software Engineering Management\n\n\nAbout the Author\nIan Sommerville is a full Professor of Software Engineering at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, where he teaches courses in advanced software engineering and critical systems engineering. His research interest lies in complex, dependable systems.\n\nIan Somerville is the recipient of the 2011 ACM SIGSOFT Influential Educator Award. This honor is in recognition of the tremendous and positive influence that his Software Engineering  textbook and companion educational aids have had on undergraduate  software-engineering education, as well as his textbooks on Requirements Engineering, and achievements in establishing the SICSA Graduate Academy.  \nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 792 pages\n    * Publisher: Addison Wesley; 9 edition (March 13, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0137035152\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0137035151","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6ad9572a65ab65c8acccb67fa0b400879b5a2c2","amp;dn":"Software+Engineering+%2C9th+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6ad9572a65ab65c8acccb67fa0b400879b5a2c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,173,149,114,166,90,182,92,138,204,203,103,250,11,64,8,121,181,162,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
