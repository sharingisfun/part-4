It's the follow-up to 1989's highly successful The Real Thing, as well as the final studio album with long time guitarist &quot;Big&quot; Jim Martin and the second to feature Mike Patton on vocals; it is, however, the first album in which Patton had an influence on the band's sound, as Patton hadn't previously had input on the musical composition of the album's predecessor, The Real Thing, as it had all been composed and recorded prior to his joining. It remains as Faith No More's highest-selling album outside the United States (where, as of July 2007, it has sold 664,000 copies). The album and subsequent tour were very successful in Europe where it went Platinum for sales of more than 1 million copies and Gold in Australia for selling more than 35,000 copies. Worldwide sales are around 3 million copies.\n\nAmazon.com Review By Genevieve Williams - An amazing album, Angel Dust unfortunately has limited appeal, although perhaps &quot;unfortunately&quot; isn't the right word; the record's oddities are also what make it such a fascinating listen. &quot;Land of Sunshine&quot; is a rocker with a foot-tapping rhythm punctuated by insane laughter from vocalist Mike Patton, whose distinctive voice and frequently disturbing lyrics drive the album. To call it hard rock does Angel Dust a disservice; it's far more musically complex than such a label implies. There's the funk-influenced &quot;Midlife Crisis,&quot; the ballad &quot;RV&quot; (a bitter monologue from the point of view of a middle-aged discontent sitting in his trailer), the hard-edged claustrophobia of &quot;Smaller and Smaller,&quot; and the rock-married-to-electronic-organ &quot;Be Aggressive,&quot; which includes positively inspired cheerleader chants on the chorus. Impossible to classify but incredibly entertaining (there isn't a single boring moment on this album), Angel Dust is well worth picking up.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Land Of Sunshine\n[02] Caffeine\n[03] Midlife Crisis\n[04] RV\n[05] Smaller And Smaller\n[06] Everything's Ruined\n[07] Malpractice\n[08] Kindergarten\n[09] Be Aggressive\n[10] A Small Victory\n[11] Crack Hitler\n[12] Jizzlobber\n[13] Midnight Cowboy \n \n\n\nTotal Play Time\t&gt; 00h:58m:43s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 144mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v8.1.1.10 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Rock\nRelease Date\t&gt;08 June 1992\nRecord Company\t&gt; Slash Records - London Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fnm.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fnm.com&lt;/a&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith_No_More &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.darklyrics.com/f/faithnomore.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.darklyrics.com/f/faithnomore.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.muzu.tv/faithnomore&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.muzu.tv/faithnomore&lt;/a&gt; \n \n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b255607b1c65ec5cf966f37e1167f19a1b4c4bf6","amp;dn":"%5B1992%5D+Angel+Dust+-+Faith+No+More+-+144mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b255607b1c65ec5cf966f37e1167f19a1b4c4bf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,85,96,123,28,101,236,92,249,102,243,126,17,103,241,154,27,76,75,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
