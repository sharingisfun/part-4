With its fine-grained yet flexible approach, it is no wonder Linux distributions are firing up SELinux as a default security measure.\n\nSELinux System Administration covers the majority of SELinux features through a mix of real-life scenarios, descriptions, and examples. Everything an administrator needs to further tune SELinux to suit their needs are present in this book.\n\nThis book touches on various SELinux topics, guiding you through the configuration of SELinux contexts, definitions, and the assignment of SELinux roles, and finishes up with policy enhancements. All of SELinux's configuration handles, be they conditional policies, constraints, policy types, or audit capabilities, are covered in this book with genuine examples that administrators might come across.\n\nBy the end, SELinux System Administration will have taught you how to configure your Linux system to be more secure, powered by a formidable mandatory access control.\nApproach\n\nA step-by-step guide to learn how to set up security on Linux servers by taking SELinux policies into your own hands.\nWho this book is for\n\nLinux administrators will enjoy the various SELinux features that this book covers and the approach used to guide the admin into understanding how SELinux works. The book assumes that you have basic knowledge in Linux administration, especially Linux permission and user management.\n\n\n\n\n\nScientia est potentia\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d58e77857d87f622897dbab074c117fbca144b86","amp;dn":"SELinux+Policy+Administration%2C+2013+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d58e77857d87f622897dbab074c117fbca144b86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,142,119,133,125,135,246,34,137,125,186,176,116,193,23,251,202,20,75,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
