A Grin Without a Cat (the idiomatic French title, Le Fond de l'Air Est Rouge, can be literally translated as &quot;The Essence of the Air is Red&quot;) is divided into two parts. The first part, called &quot;Fragile Hands,&quot; focuses on the emergence of leftist movements circa 1967, the Vietnam War serving as the lightning rod for radicals of all stripes to come together to agitate for their utopian dreams. The second part, entitled &quot;Severed Hands,&quot; details the slow demise of the invigorated left, from forces within (the discord between different factions) and without (the role of the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. in keeping the countries in their backyards in line). This three-hour epic offers a stunning assemblage of period footage. For younger viewers, excerpts of iconic historical figures such as Fidel Castro, Che Guevarra, Mao Tse-tung, and Salvador Allende should be particularly eye-opening. For all its expansiveness, A Grin Without a Cat flits by with blithe disregard for the audience's level of acquaintance with the events and figures discussed. Consequently, viewers well-versed in the history of the period might find Marker's essay on the New Left more fulfilling than those without any background on the subject. \n\nFile Name:\nFile Size (in bytes): 1,048,803,328 bytes\nRuntime: 1:29:15\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size: 512x384 (AR: 1.333)\nFPS: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate: 1388 kb/s\nBits per Pixel: 0.294 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate: 166 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams: 1\n\n\nFile Name:\nFile Size (in bytes): 1,049,749,504 bytes\nRuntime: 1:28:50\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size: 512x384 (AR: 1.333)\nFPS: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate: 1400 kb/s\nBits per Pixel: 0.297 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate: 163 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams: 1\n\nEnglish subpack\n\nIMDB: tt0076042","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab9fcaf6eaf28e0c5682eff17388f7b8ed87cf9b","amp;dn":"Chris+Marker+-++Le+fond+de+l%5C%27air+est+rouge+%281977%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab9fcaf6eaf28e0c5682eff17388f7b8ed87cf9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,159,202,246,234,242,142,12,86,130,239,241,115,136,247,184,237,135,207,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
