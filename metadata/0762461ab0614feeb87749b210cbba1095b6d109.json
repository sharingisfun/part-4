The discs produced can only be read on MacOS. The images are 100% identical clones of the original discs, nothing added, nothing removed. No serial number protection to my knowledge.\n\nIf you don't need the whole package (this is quite big) only download the ISO you need from the torrent. \n\nThis release is for POWER PC Processors ONLY; it won't work on Intel Macs and Hackintoshes. \n\nWill work on PowerPC G3, PowerPC G4 (tested). May work on other PowerPC macs as well, find a wiki on MacOS 9.2.2 and MacOS 10.1.2 on google and check it out.  \n\nTo boot from a CD on a G4 inser the disk, restart the computer while pressing the 'c' key on the keyboard. Only release the key when the boot sequence has started from the CD. \n\nCheers !\n\n- MacOS 9.2.2\n- MacOS 10.1.2 \n- Apple hardware Test \n- iPhoto \n- Apple Apps Bundled with PowerMAC G4 (don't know what it actually contains :D)\n- Roxio Toast Titanium 7.0.1 (Works fine witout SN on both PowerPC and Intel. Just Unzip &amp; Run)\n\nI hope you find these useful !\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0762461ab0614feeb87749b210cbba1095b6d109","amp;dn":"Mac+OS+9.2.2+%2B+MacOS+10.1.2+%2B+Apple+Apps.+%2B+Roxio+Toast+Titanium","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0762461ab0614feeb87749b210cbba1095b6d109","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,98,70,26,176,97,79,238,184,119,73,178,16,203,186,16,149,182,209,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
