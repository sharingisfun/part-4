The central character, Guy Montag, is employed as a &quot;fireman&quot; (which, in this future, means &quot;bookburner&quot;). The number &quot;451&quot; refers to the temperature at which book paper combusts. Although sources contemporary with the novel's writing gave the temperature as 450 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°C (842 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°F), Bradbury apparently thought &quot;Fahrenheit&quot; made for a better title.The &quot;firemen&quot; burn them &quot;for the good of humanity&quot;. Written in the early years of the Cold War, the novel is a critique of what Bradbury saw as issues in American society of the era.\n\nRead by the author\n\nPlease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2758f11fd5f0d8d6309cedae0693f496460bc76","amp;dn":"Fahrenheit+451-Ray+Bradbury","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2758f11fd5f0d8d6309cedae0693f496460bc76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,117,143,17,253,95,13,141,99,9,206,218,224,105,63,73,100,96,188,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
