He is a noted guitar instructor through his work with the UK magazine Guitar Techniques, GuildfordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Academy of Contemporary Music, Lick Library and currently the Brighton Institute of Modern Music. He is the 1993 winner of Guitarist magazine's &quot;Guitarist of the Year&quot; competition.\n\nDespite his magazine success and achievements with Asia and other bands, it was his exposure on YouTube through clips of his playing which has led him to being considered one of the world's best contemporary electric guitar players,[1][2] and one of the most flexible players in musical scope, although he is primarily considered a jazz fusion player and rock guitarist. As a result, Govan now regularly travels internationally, teaching at various clinics around the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:634a095369671fe3530c34130eb22500bd4824de","amp;dn":"Guthrie+Govan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"634a095369671fe3530c34130eb22500bd4824de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,74,9,83,105,103,31,227,83,12,52,19,14,178,37,0,189,72,36,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
