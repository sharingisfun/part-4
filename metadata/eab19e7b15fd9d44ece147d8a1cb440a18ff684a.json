It is an educational format made up of five simple steps for creating photorealistic renders in the field of pre-visualization for architecture, mechanics and design. It uses photography â€“ and the basic concepts behind it â€“ as point of reference.\r\n\r\nFraming, Light Balance, Materials, Final Settings and Post-production are the five crucial phases in the innovative 5-Step Render Workflow (5SRW) method. Examined without technicalities, these phases form a simple and deliberate pathway that aims to guide and encourage full awareness of each step leading to the creation of any kind of render.\r\n\r\nEach topic has a theoretical introduction, designed to prepare the reader for the pratical use of the V-Ray parameters. In this book, the final outcome is not intended to be an end in itself. Instead, the focus is placed on the process used to achieve it. In line with this logic, the various exercises and videos accompanying the book are means, rather than ends, that will allow you to reason with greater awareness.\r\n\r\nThe book is targeted both to readers who have never used V-Ray, as well as those who already have experience with the software and are simply loking for a way to organize their ideas simply and with greater coherence.\r\n\r\nTopics covered in the book:\r\n\r\n00 â€“ Introduction\r\n01 â€“ First Steps in V-Ray\r\n02 â€“ Compensation Using the Gamma Curve\r\n03 â€“ Global Illumination and Irradiance map\r\n04 â€“ The DSLR Camera in V-Ray\r\n05 â€“ Light Balance\r\n06 â€“ Simulating Materials\r\n07 â€“ Exposure\r\n08 â€“ Exterior Rendering\r\n09 â€“ V-Ray Sun System\r\n10 â€“ Simulating Vegetation and Textiles\r\n11 â€“ The 5SRW Method and Interior Rendering\r\n12 â€“ Other Lights and HDRI\r\n13 â€“ White Balance and Contrast\r\n14 â€“ Optimizing Rendering Time\r\n15 â€“ SOS: How not to Freak Out\r\n\r\nThe book is suitable for any version of V-Ray\r\nAll explanations, concepts and results that can be obtained\r\nare not bound to a specific version of V-Ray.\r\nThey concern the application of photography to the rendering engine,\r\nare therefore applicable to both versions 2 and 3 of V-Ray for 3ds Max.\r\nFor the type of approach the book is also apreciated\r\nfrom users who use V-Ray for Rhino, SketchUp, Maya and C4D.\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation about the author\r\nCiro Sannino has been involved in training and dissemination since 2004. He is one of the few instructors officially approved by Chaos Group (the creators of V-Ray) and the inventor of the 5SRW, a method structured into 5 steps that guides users in developing their own projects in V-Ray with a purely photographic approach.\r\n\r\nContents of the attached DVD:\r\nAttached to the book is a DVD containing a folder called P&amp;R-VRay, in which you will find .MAX files, videos relating to the concepts explained and .JPG files of the images contained in the book. It also contains 3D models from designconnected.com and textures della arroway-textures.com\r\n\r\nWho is it for the book?\r\nThe book is intended both for those who have never used V-Ray, as well as those who are already familiar with the software but are looking for a way to organize their ideas in a simpler and more straightforward way.\r\n\r\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eab19e7b15fd9d44ece147d8a1cb440a18ff684a","amp;dn":"Ciro+Sannino+-+Photography+And+Rendering+With+VRay+%28eBook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eab19e7b15fd9d44ece147d8a1cb440a18ff684a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,177,158,123,21,253,157,68,236,225,71,216,161,203,68,10,24,255,104,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
