He has been a key playwright of the National Theatre and is one of the most internationally performed dramatists of his generation.  His two great stage successes were ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN ARE DEAD (1966) and THE REAL THING (1982), and he reached an even wider audience -- and won an Academy Award -- for his screenplay for the 1998 film SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE.  He has won 4 Tony Awards.  Themes of human rights, censorship and political freedom pervade his work along with exploration of linguistics and philosophy.\n\n\nThe following books are a mix of ePUB and PDF formats:\n\n* ARCADIA (Faber &amp; Faber, 1993) -- ePUB + PDF\n\n* THE COAST OF UTOPIA: Part II.
