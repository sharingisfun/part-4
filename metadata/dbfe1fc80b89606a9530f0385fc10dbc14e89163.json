In desperation, he consults a psychotherapist who promises to help him -- but who, it soon becomes clear, has his own plans for George and his dreams.\n\nThe Lathe of Heaven is a dark vision and a warning -- a fable of power uncontrolled and uncontrollable. It is a truly prescient and startling view of humanity, and the consequences of playing God.\n\nGenre: Science Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbfe1fc80b89606a9530f0385fc10dbc14e89163","amp;dn":"The+Lathe+of+Heaven+by+Ursula+K.+Le+Guin+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbfe1fc80b89606a9530f0385fc10dbc14e89163","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,254,31,200,11,137,96,106,149,48,240,56,95,193,13,188,20,232,145,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
