The film is a very loose adaptation of Gustave Flaubert's novel Madame Bovary.\n\nThe film takes place in the isolated village of Kinnery on the Dingle Peninsula in Ireland during World War I. The villagers are nationalist and exclusionary, taunting the village idiot Michael (John Mills) and British soldiers from a nearby army base. They are resentful of Rosy Ryan (Sarah Miles), the spoilt daughter of the local publican Tom Ryan (Leo McKern), who himself is an informer for the British hoping to keep the peace in the village.\n\nDirected by David Lean \nProduced by Anthony Havelock-Allan \nWritten by Robert Bolt \nStarring Robert Mitchum\nSarah Miles\nJohn Mills\nChristopher Jones\nLeo McKern \n\nRelease date(s) 9 November 1970 (premiere) \nRunning time 195 min. \nLanguage English\n\nThe film has also been criticised for its perceived depiction of the Irish proletariat as uncivilised compared with the occupying British forces and the Catholic church. Moreover some have criticised the film as an attempt to blacken the legacy of the 1916 Easter Rising and the subsequent Irish War of Independence in relation to the eruption of &quot;the Troubles&quot; in Northern Ireland at the time of the film's release.\n\nSince the film's recent release on DVD, Ryan's Daughter has been re-considered by many critics, and has been claimed by many to be an overlooked masterpiece, countering many of the criticisms (such as its alleged &quot;excessive scale&quot;) in the process. Other elements, such as John Mills' caricature 'village idiot' (ironically an Oscar-winning performance) have withstood the test of time less well. The film is still not as widely accepted as Lean's other epics, and its critical reputation remains mixed at best.\n\nDISC 1\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 700 MiB for 1h 34mn 2s 0ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : DVD9\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 914 Kbps\nAspect            : 656 x 304 (2.158) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 114 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nDISC 2\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 700 MiB for 1h 32mn 26s 0ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : DVD9\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 932 Kbps\nAspect            : 656 x 304 (2.158) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 114 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee974149d2c5d479d79828b801d3884925209b27","amp;dn":"Ryan%5C%27s+Daughter-%281970%29+%5BDVDrip+%28XviD%29%5D%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee974149d2c5d479d79828b801d3884925209b27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,151,65,73,210,197,212,121,215,152,40,184,1,211,136,73,37,32,155,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
