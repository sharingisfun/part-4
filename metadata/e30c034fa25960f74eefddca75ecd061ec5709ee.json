As Gore Vidal wrote 'Of all tasks, describing the contents of a book is the most difficult and in the case of a marvellous invention like Invisible Cities, perfectly irrelevant.'\n\nAudio CD\nPublisher: Tantor Media Inc; Unabridged edition (24 Jun 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1452614482\nISBN-13: 978-1452614489\n\n[Read By John Lee]\n\n\nBiography:\n__\n\nItalo Calvino was born in Cuba in 1923 and grew up in Italy. He was an essayist and journalist and a member of the editorial staff of Einaudi in Turin. One of the most respected writers of our time, his best-known works of fiction include Invisible Cities, If on a Winter's Night a Traveller, Marcovaldo and Mr Palomar. In 1973 he won the prestigious Premio Feltrinelli. He died in 1985. A collection of Calvino's posthumous personal writings, The Hermit in Paris, was published in 2003.\n\n\n* It's really disappointing to see not a single torrent exist of such a classical book.
