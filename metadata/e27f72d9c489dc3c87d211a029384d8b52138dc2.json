Cisco UCS is a unified solution that consolidates computing, network and storage connectivity components along-with centralized management. Cisco UCS reduces TCO and improves scalability and flexibility. Stateless computing blade server's design simplifies the troubleshooting, and Cisco-patented extended memory technology provides higher virtualized servers consolidation results.\n\nA hands-on guide to take you through deployment in Cisco UCS. With real-world examples for configuring and deploying Cisco UCS components, this book will prepare you for the practical deployments of Cisco UCS data centre solutions.\n\nIf you want to learn and enhance your hands-on skills with Cisco UCS solutions, this book is certainly for you.\n\nStarting with the description of Cisco UCS equipment options, this hands-on guide then introduces Cisco UCS Emulator which is an excellent resource to practically learn Cisco UCS componentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ deployment. You will also be introduced to all areas of UCS solutions with practical configuration examples.\n\nYou will also discover the Cisco UCS Manager, which is the centralized management interface for Cisco UCS. Once you get to know UCS Manager, the book dives deeper into configuring LAN, SAN, identity pools, resource pools, and service profiles for the servers. The book also presents other administration topics including Backup, Restore, userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s roles, and high availability cluster configuration. Finally, you will learn about virtualized networking, 3rd party integration tools and testing failure scenarios.\n\nYou will learn everything you need to know for the rapidly growing Cisco UCS deployments in the real-world.\nApproach\n\nA tutorial-based approach which will help you understand the practical methodologies and deploying of Cisco UCS components.\nWho this book is for\n\nIf you are a professional such as a system, network, or storage administrator who is responsible for Cisco UCS deployments, this is the perfect book for you. You should have some basic knowledge of the serverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s architecture, network, and storage technologies. Familiarity with virtualization technologies is also recommended (though not necessary) as the majority of real-world UCS deployments run virtualized loads. Knowledge of Nexus OS is not necessary as the majority of the management tasks are handled in a graphical user interface with very few exceptions using the CLI.\n\n\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e27f72d9c489dc3c87d211a029384d8b52138dc2","amp;dn":"Implementing+Cisco+UCS+Solutions+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e27f72d9c489dc3c87d211a029384d8b52138dc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,127,114,217,196,137,220,60,135,210,17,160,41,56,77,139,82,19,141,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
