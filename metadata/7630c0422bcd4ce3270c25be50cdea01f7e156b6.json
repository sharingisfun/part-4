The lectures in this audio, recorded in the '50s, are fascinating glimpses into his steadfast, somewhat authoritarian, and eminently relevant teachings. Though his speaking style often has an overly aggressive quality, there's something magical about hearing it. We are handed many gifts, Hill says, many opportunities for meaning, but we can tap into them only when we connect with the guiding force that put them there. We do this by trusting God, dedicating ourselves to a single purpose in life, and paying daily attention to programming our subconscious minds. This is a seminal work on the basics of personal motivation.\n\nNapoleon Hill is the acknowledged master of motivational speakers. The principles and philosophy of success that he outlined in his masterwork, The Laws of Success, and his international bestseller, Think and Grow Rich, have served as the foundation for every motivational speaker since.\n\nIn these rare recordings you will hear a complete and thorough exposition of Napoleon Hill's life-altering philosophy of personal achievement.
