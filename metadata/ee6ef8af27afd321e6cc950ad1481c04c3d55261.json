Its precracked.\n\nThe best way to use ALLDATA because its over 100 DVD's is to uncompress the ISO's to seperate folders on a hard drive. I install them into an external drive. \nAnyone who has done this knows after you &quot;install&quot; alldata itself, you have to manually enter where the files are. thats over 97 enteries to type in.\nI have this version of portable set to drive &quot;S&quot; \nMeaning, put your data disks on a drive and then in windows control panel, change that drive letter under disk management to drive &quot;S&quot;\nRun this version and its all setup!\n\nOne last note, when you unzip your data disks (the ISO's) to a drive, create a directory called &quot;AllData10&quot;\nThen unzip the data disk ISO's into that folder. Then just run my portable and you are all setup!\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee6ef8af27afd321e6cc950ad1481c04c3d55261","amp;dn":"AllData+10.53+2013+Portable+Drive+set+to+S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee6ef8af27afd321e6cc950ad1481c04c3d55261","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,110,248,175,39,175,211,33,230,204,149,10,209,72,28,4,195,213,82,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
