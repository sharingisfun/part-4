Our Christian &quot;brothers&quot; who started so typical for them, rabid crusade when I upped movie-torrent &quot;Creation&quot; - innocent movie about private affairs of Charles Darwin. Spreading the word on forums full of Christian love, they formed &quot;strike-force&quot; and rabidly pounded my torrent with I think, 740 and change &quot;minuses&quot;\n\n3. Our Jewish brothers pounded my first upping of UK TV four-part drama &quot;The Promise&quot; as quote from The Jewish Chronicle &quot;Fatah could have written The Promise&quot; implies.\n\nUpfront, I wish to say that I am European, I am raised Catholic and I am white-skin colored and non-Arab. I have a face, and you don't. Evil things cannot be swapped under carpet and cease to exist. Simple as that.\nYou are wrong and you have been wrong. That is The Truth. Serbs slaughtered 165000 people in 90-ties of 20-eth century, Darwin was right and Palestinians have right to live on their land, with their Jewish brothers. Period.\n\nAlso, world would never be according to Jim, Slobodan, Chaim or Mohammed , but, unfortunately for some, as we ALL make him to be.\n\nNOTE: For any &quot;minus&quot;, for any rabid outburst I would prolong and intensify seeding of this and any other similar torrent, which is - just a torrent. As I am just a man, one of many. But with a face. And opinions.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6db4ac27bc2f1cd1a3ada6eae6e98c41a9ff04e6","amp;dn":"The.Promise.2011.Complete.BluRay.480p.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6db4ac27bc2f1cd1a3ada6eae6e98c41a9ff04e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,180,172,39,188,47,28,209,163,173,166,234,230,233,140,65,169,255,4,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
