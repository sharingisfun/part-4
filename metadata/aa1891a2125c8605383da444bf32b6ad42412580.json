Around this time, the band was starting to multitrack a handful of their live shows with the hope of using the material to create their first album, Remember Two Things (11/9/93). None of the material on this Live Trax release has been released until now!\n\nThe band recorded portions of the three night run at The Muse. However, technical issues prevented the band from capturing all three shows in their entirety. What has been mixed and mastered is representative of a relatively new band bringing its increasingly potent live show to a new brand of listener. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to imagine the band writing and performing all summer on the island as you listen to spot-on renditions of songs that are now classics.\n\nLet me know if you want the FLAC version.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa1891a2125c8605383da444bf32b6ad42412580","amp;dn":"Live+Trax+Vol.+30%2C+Dave+Matthews+Band%2C+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa1891a2125c8605383da444bf32b6ad42412580","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,24,145,162,18,92,134,5,56,61,164,68,191,50,182,173,66,65,37,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
