M. G. Le CLÃƒâ€°ZIO (b. 1940) is a French-Mauritian writer and professor.  Le ClÃƒÂ©zio was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Literature as an &quot;author of new departures, poetic adventure and sensual ecstasy, explorer of a humanity beyond and below the reigning civilization.&quot;  He has written over forty highly acclaimed books and has been translated into thirty-six languages.\n\nTHE INTERROGATION [Le ProcÃƒÂ¨s-Verbal], his first novel, won the Prix Renaudot in 1963.  London's Sunday Telegraph called it &quot;a brilliant and fascinating literary debut, flecked throughout with an originality and a freshness of thought which stirs the imagination.&quot;\n\nThe Swedish Academy, in awarding the Nobel Prize, praised DESERT [DÃƒÂ©sert] as Le ClÃƒÂ©zio's &quot;definitive breakthrough as a novelist.&quot;  Published in France in 1980, the book received the Grand Prix Paul Morand from the AcadÃƒÂ©mie FranÃƒÂ§aise.\n\n\nBoth the following are in EPUB format:\n\n* DESERT (David R. Godine, 2009).  Translated by C. Dickson.\n\n* THE INTERROGATION (Penguin, 2008).  Translated by Daphne Woodward.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe5a892495135065de01287b3c117bddb196c9fd","amp;dn":"J.+M.+G.+Le+Clezio+-+French+novelist+%282+books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe5a892495135065de01287b3c117bddb196c9fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,90,137,36,149,19,80,101,222,1,40,123,60,17,123,221,177,150,201,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
