Sometimes, they can even hold us back. Emotions like anger, anxiety, or doubt might be uncomfortable, but it turns out that they are also incredibly useful.\n\nFor instance:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Anger fuels creativity\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Guilt sparks improvement\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Self-doubt enhances performance\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Selfishness increases courage\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Mindlessness leads to better decisions\n\nThe key lies in what the authors call Ã¢â‚¬Å“emotional agility,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the ability to access our full range of emotionsÃ¢â‚¬â€¢not just the Ã¢â‚¬Å“goodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ onesÃ¢â‚¬â€¢in order to respond most effectively to whatever situation we might encounter. Drawing on years of scientific research and a wide array of real-life examples including sports, the military, parenting, education, romance, business, and more, The Upside of Your Dark Side is a refreshing reality check that shows us how we can truly maximize our potential","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4fc2b881a8afddbe747ab3af878051fcab8365d","amp;dn":"The+Upside+of+Your+Dark+Side","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4fc2b881a8afddbe747ab3af878051fcab8365d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,252,43,136,26,138,253,219,231,71,171,58,248,120,5,31,202,184,54,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
