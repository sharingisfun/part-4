The book has been written to take somebody with 0 knowledge of patterns and them the information they need to succeed. It's got lots of pictures and lots of information regarding fashion design and industry standards aswell. All in all it's a great book and a small download so check it out if you have the chance.\n\nThe torrent has a couple files in it. I bought it off the amazon store, there's the original AZW3 file in there, I'm not sure if it's decrypted or not but there is an EPUB included. If you want to get your files faster don't download the AZW3 because it's probably unusable. It's in there incase it works and some users have a kindle they can easy just view it on that instead.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d1c3231bb395ca8dc9f5a43f08f90ca94f09214","amp;dn":"How+Patterns+Work+The+Fundamental+Principles+of+Pattern+Making+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d1c3231bb395ca8dc9f5a43f08f90ca94f09214","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,28,50,49,187,57,92,168,220,159,90,67,240,143,144,202,148,240,146,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
