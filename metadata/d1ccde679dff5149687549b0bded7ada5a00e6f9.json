The series centers on Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), a blood spatter pattern analyst for a fictional Miami Metro Police Department (based on the real life Miami-Dade Police Department) who also leads a secret life as a serial killer. Set in Miami, the show's first season was largely based on the novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter (2004), the first of the Dexter series novels by Jeff Lindsay. It was adapted for television by screenwriter James Manos, Jr., who wrote the first episode. Subsequent seasons have evolved independently of Lindsay's works. The eighth and final season of Dexter premiered on June 30, 2013.\n\n\n\nCast: Michael C. Hall\n      Jennifer Carpenter\n      Desmond Harrington\n      Julie Benz\n      David Zayas\n      C.S.
