This book draws on 25 years of design engineering experience from the author to provide you with a roadmap to understanding the design process, the elements of a successful project, the specific issues to address in a well-designed I&amp;C system, and the engineering products that enable practical design and successful maintenance. As nearly $65 billion worth of automation systems near the end of their traditional life cycle, the necessity of understanding the design process has never been more critical to engineers, technicians, and management - this book will help you achieve that understanding","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:154a68706d03f1ac84c7534b650496ba81dee09e","amp;dn":"Successful+Instrumentation+and+Control+Systems+Design%2C+2E+%5BStorm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"154a68706d03f1ac84c7534b650496ba81dee09e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,74,104,112,109,3,241,172,132,199,83,75,101,4,150,186,129,222,224,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
