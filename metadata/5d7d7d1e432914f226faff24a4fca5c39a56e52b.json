In her groundbreaking first book, she brings together Zen meditation and writing in a new way. Writing practice, as she calls it, is no different from other forms of Zen practice Ã¢â‚¬â€&quot;it is backed by two thousand years of studying the mind.&quot; \n\nThis new edition, which marks almost twenty years since the original book's publication, includes a new preface in which Goldberg expresses her trademark enthusiasm for writing practice, as well as a depth of appreciation for the process that has come with time and experience. Also included is an interview with the author in which she reflects on the relationship between Zen sitting practice and writing, the importance of place, and the power of memory.\n\nNatalie Goldberg's word-of-mouth hit has sold well over half a million copies. Goldberg, who has conducted writing workshops for both beginners and professionals all over the United States, sees writing as a practice that helps us comprehend the value of our lives. With insight, humor, and practicality, she inspires writers and would-be writers alike to take the leap into writing creatively and well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d7d7d1e432914f226faff24a4fca5c39a56e52b","amp;dn":"Writing+Down+The+Bones_+Freeing+The+Writer+Within.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d7d7d1e432914f226faff24a4fca5c39a56e52b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,125,125,30,67,41,20,242,38,250,255,36,164,252,165,195,154,86,229,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
