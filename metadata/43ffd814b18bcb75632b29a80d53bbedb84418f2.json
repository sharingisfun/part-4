Highly recommend it. Check out Night Creatures, Phantom Encounters, Wizard and Witches, Water Spirits, Dragons, Faeries, and a whole lot of the others. You won't be disappointed! What I love is the book cover itself, it has a unique hard back with a cloth cover with a beautiful illustration on the cover, and on the inside the pages are glossy and smooth, with stories that goes in depth which you can Google or go to your local library for further insight! Try this book and read it, I guarantee reading the first three pages will have you hooked and then you will want to buy and investigate more stories and books of &quot;The Enchanted World&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43ffd814b18bcb75632b29a80d53bbedb84418f2","amp;dn":"Mysterious+creatures+%28Time-Life+Mysteries+of+the+Unknown%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43ffd814b18bcb75632b29a80d53bbedb84418f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,255,216,20,177,139,203,117,99,43,41,168,13,83,187,237,184,68,24,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
