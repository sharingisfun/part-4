She has so far written three novels, Sharp Objects, for which she won the 2007 Ian Fleming Steel Dagger for the best thriller; Dark Places; and her best-selling third novel Gone Girl. Her books have received wide praise, including from authors such as Stephen King.\n\nSharp Objects\n\nWICKED above her hipbone, GIRL across her heart\nWords are like a road map to reporter Camille PreakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s troubled past. Fresh from a brief stay at a psych hospital, CamilleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first assignment from the second-rate daily paper where she works brings her reluctantly back to her hometown to cover the murders of two preteen girls.\n\nNASTY on her kneecap, BABYDOLL on her leg\nSince she left town eight years ago, Camille has hardly spoken to her neurotic, hypochondriac mother or to the half-sister she barely knows: a beautiful thirteen-year-old with an eerie grip on the town. Now, installed again in her familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Victorian mansion, Camille is haunted by the childhood tragedy she has spent her whole life trying to cut from her memory.\n\nHARMFUL on her wrist, WHORE on her ankle\nAs Camille works to uncover the truth about these violent crimes, she finds herself identifying with the young victimsÃ¢â‚¬â€a bit too strongly. Clues keep leading to dead ends, forcing Camille to unravel the psychological puzzle of her own past to get at the story. Dogged by her own demons, Camille will have to confront what happened to her years before if she wants to survive this homecoming.\n\n\nDark Places\n\nLibby Day was seven when her mother and two sisters were murdered in Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Satan Sacrifice of Kinnakee, Kansas.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ As her family lay dying, little Libby fled their tiny farmhouse into the freezing January snow. She lost some fingers and toes, but she survivedÃ¢â‚¬â€œand famously testified that her fifteen-year-old brother, Ben, was the killer. Twenty-five years later, Ben sits in prison, and troubled Libby lives off the dregs of a trust created by well-wishers whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve long forgotten her.\n\nThe Kill Club is a macabre secret society obsessed with notorious crimes. When they locate Libby and pump her for detailsÃ¢â‚¬â€œproof they hope may free BenÃ¢â‚¬â€œLibby hatches a plan to profit off her tragic history. For a fee, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll reconnect with the players from that night and report her findings to the clubÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and maybe sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll admit her testimony wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t so solid after all.\n\nAs LibbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s search takes her from shabby Missouri strip clubs to abandoned Oklahoma tourist towns, the narrative flashes back to January 2, 1985. The events of that day are relayed through the eyes of LibbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doomed family membersÃ¢â‚¬â€œincluding Ben, a loner whose rage over his shiftless father and their failing farm have driven him into a disturbing friendship with the new girl in town. Piece by piece, the unimaginable truth emerges, and Libby finds herself right back where she startedÃ¢â‚¬â€œon the run from a killer.\n\n\nGone Girl\n\nOn a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and AmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick DunneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick Dunne isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s head, but hearing from Amy through flashbacks in her diary reveal the perky perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the mediaÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as AmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fiercely doting parentsÃ¢â‚¬â€the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s definitely bitterÃ¢â‚¬â€but is he really a killer ? As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister Margo at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do it, where is that beautiful wife ? And what was left in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet ?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0296c8b67dc8fedd68b2e5ace710e1532ae27407","amp;dn":"The+Novels+of+Gillian+Flynn+-+Sharp+Objects%2C+Dark+Places+%26amp%3B+G","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0296c8b67dc8fedd68b2e5ace710e1532ae27407","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,150,200,182,125,200,254,221,104,178,229,172,231,16,225,83,42,226,116,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
