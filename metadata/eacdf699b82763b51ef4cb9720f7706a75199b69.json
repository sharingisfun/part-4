Popular views of medieval chivalryÃ¢â‚¬â€knights in shining armor, fair ladies, banners fluttering from battlementsÃ¢â‚¬â€were inherited from the nineteenth-century Romantics. This is the first book to explore chivalryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s place within a wider history of medieval England, from the Norman Conquest to the aftermath of Henry VIIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s triumph at Bosworth in the Wars of the Roses.\nSaul invites us to view the world of castles and cathedrals, tournaments and round tables, with fresh eyes.Chivalry in Medieval England charts the introduction of chivalry by the Normans, the rise of the knightly class as a social elite, the fusion of chivalry with kingship in the fourteenth century, and the influence of chivalry on literature, religion, and architecture. Richard the Lionheart and the Crusades, the Black Death and the Battle of Crecy, the Magna Carta and the cult of King ArthurÃ¢â‚¬â€all emerge from the mists of time and legend in this vivid, authoritative account.\nThanks due to the original PDF uploader.
