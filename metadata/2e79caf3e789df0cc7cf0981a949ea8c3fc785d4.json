Afterwards, his mother sends him to Madrid to live with his father, Martin.\n\nMartin, a successful film-maker, doesn't want to take care of his son because he likes living alone and being able to socialize with his two friends, Alicia and Dante, without influencing his son in any negative way since both Alicia and Dante are experienced drug users. Regardless, he brings him into his home, hoping to ward off any evil influences that might cause his son to have a relapse and commit suicide.\n\nAs time passes and Martin's friendships get more strained, it becomes clear that Hache needs to leave his father's place and make a name for himself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e79caf3e789df0cc7cf0981a949ea8c3fc785d4","amp;dn":"Martin+%28Hache%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e79caf3e789df0cc7cf0981a949ea8c3fc785d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,121,202,243,231,137,223,12,199,207,9,129,169,73,234,140,63,199,133,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
