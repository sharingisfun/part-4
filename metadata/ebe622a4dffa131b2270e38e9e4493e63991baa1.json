Robert Duvall and Ann-Margret also appeared in supporting roles. The movie gained a cult following after its initial failure at the box office. The film marked the directorial debut of Dirty Dancing choreographer Kenny Ortega (High School Musical) and featured the music of composer Alan Menken (Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, Aladdin).\n\nAlthough the film was not originally intended to be a musical, it contains twelve songs and multiple dance sequences (for which the young cast trained for approximately 10 weeks). Musical highlights include &quot;Carrying the Banner,&quot; &quot;Santa Fe,&quot; &quot;Seize The Day,&quot; and &quot;King of New York.&quot;\n\nNewsies was not a commercial success when first released; in fact, it ranked among the highest-costing and lowest-grossing Disney live-action films in the studio&amp;#039;s history. Movie critic/historian Leonard Maltin even christened it &quot;Howard the Paperboy&quot; (in reference to another infamous box-office flop, Howard the Duck).\n\nHowever, the picture gained fans when it was released on VHS and was played on the Disney Channel. After much petitioning, Newsies was released on DVD in 2002. It has since gained a modest yet enthusiastic cult following.\n\nTaglines:\n\n    * A Thousand Voices. A Single Dream.\n    * They Found the Courage to Challenge the Powerful! (DVD release)\n\nThe soundtrack to Newsies was released in 1992 by Disney. A remastered reissue was released in 2001. The music was composed by Alan Menken and the lyrics were written by Jack Feldman.\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. Prologue ? 0:48\n   2. Carrying the Banner ? 6:15\n   3. Santa Fe ? 4:18\n   4.
