The Fades can't be seen, smelt, heard or touched by other humans ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ they are what is left of humans who have died but not been accepted into Heaven. As such, the Fades left on Earth have become embittered and vengeful towards the human race. We are shown in the first episode that the Fades have found a way to become partly human again and regain control of touch within the real world. However, they remain unseen in the world except to those special few like Paul ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 'Angelics' ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ who have the ability to perceive the Fades. Paul finds himself pulled into a conflict between the Angelics and the Fades, trying to prevent the Fades from breaking back into the world and destroying the human race. The Fades school scenes were filmed at Queens School, Bushey.\n\n\n********************************************************************************\n********************************************************************************\n+++SPOILER WARNING +++ SPOILER WARNING +++ SPOILER WARNING +++SPOILER WARNING+++\n\n\nList of Episodes:\n\n\nSeason 1, Episode 1:\n\n17-year-old geek Paul can see the spirits of the dead.
