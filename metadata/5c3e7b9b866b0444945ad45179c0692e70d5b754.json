Six years on, Sam Peel is released from jail for killing Trife and he soon realises that life is no easier on the outside than it was on the inside and heâ€™s forced to confront the people he hurt the most. Some have moved on, others are stuck with the repercussions of his actions that night, but one thingâ€™s for certain - everyone has been forced to grow up. During his 24 hour journey through West London, Sam struggles to deal with his sorrow and guilt and something else he didnâ€™t expect â€“ those seeking revenge. As heâ€™s pursued by a new generation of bad boys, Sam sets about trying to get the message across to his pursuers that they should stop the violence, much like Trife tried to tell him all those years ago. As Sam battles to end the cycle of violence he started, his new journey is one of discovery, both about the world he came from and the new one heâ€™s trying to create. Can Sam make something positive from the destruction he caused or will his journey into Adulthood end here?\r\n\r\nFormat: MKV\r\nVideo Codec: H.264 High Profile @L4.1\r\nAudio Codec: DTS-HD MA\r\nVideo: MPEG4/ISO/AVC 1920x1036, 18.3 Mbps, 23.976 fps\r\nAudio: 5.1, 48kHz, DTS-HD MA, 1509.00 kbps, 24-bit","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c3e7b9b866b0444945ad45179c0692e70d5b754","amp;dn":"Kidulthood+%2B+Adulthood+%282006-2008%29+BDRip+1080p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c3e7b9b866b0444945ad45179c0692e70d5b754","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,62,123,155,134,107,4,68,148,90,212,81,121,192,105,46,112,213,183,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
