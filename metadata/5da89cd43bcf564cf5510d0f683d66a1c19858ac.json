In A BeginnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Guide to Irrational Behavior, you will learn about some of the many ways in which we behave in less than rational ways, and how we might overcome our shortcomings. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also learn about cases where our irrationalities work in our favor, and how we can harness these human tendencies to make better decisions.\n\n\n\nInstructor:\nDan Ariely\nProfessor of Psychology and Behavioral Economics\nFuqua School of Business\nDuke University\n\n\n\nAbout the Course::\nThis course will draw heavily on my own research, and pulls largely from my three books: Predictably Irrational (2008), The Upside of Irrationality (2010), and The Honest Truth About Dishonesty (2012). We will examine topics such as our Ã¢â‚¬Å“irrationalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ patterns of thinking about money and investments, how expectations shape perception, economic and psychological analyses of dishonesty by honest people, how social and financial incentives work together (or against each other) in labor, how self-control comes into play with decision making, and how emotion (rather than cognition) can have a large impact on economic decisions. This highly interdisciplinary course will be relevant to all human beings.\n\n\n\nThe goals of this class::\nIntroduce you to the range of cases where people (consumers, investors, managers, friends, significant others, and even you) might make decisions that are inconsistent with standard economic theory and the assumptions of rational decision making. This is the lens of behavioral economics.\nHelp you think creatively about the applications of behavioral economics to the development of new products, technologies and public policy, and to understand how business and social policy strategies could be modified with a deeper understanding of the effects these principles have on all of us.\nCourse Syllabus\nThere are two tracks that you can take to receive a Statement of Accomplishment for this course. For each track, you will need to earn a grade of 85% or above, but your path toward that grade will be different under each track.\n\n\n\nCourse Includes::\n\nPrecourse: Introduction to Behavioral Economics\nMeet Dan Ariely (2:53)\nSite Tour (5:46)\nHow to Pass this Class (2:27)\nManaging Your Time (5:40)\n\n\n\nWeek 1: Irrationality\n1.1 Visual and Decision Illusions (19:16)\n1.2 Defaults (19:57)\n1.3 Do We Know Our Preferences?
