Comparing the music in the United States to the &quot;European&quot; versions of the blues, Bonamassa found the English blues - fostered by the Jeff Beck Group, Eric Clapton and Irish blues player Rory Gallagher - to be far more interesting to him than the original Delta blues players. In an interview in Guitarist magazine (issue 265), he cited the three albums that had the biggest influence on his playing: John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton (the Beano album), Rory Gallagher's Irish Tour and Goodbye by Cream. He also stated Stevie Ray Vaughan's Texas Flood was a big influence at a young age. He also listed the early blues playing of Jethro Tull as one of his influences, putting both Martin Barre and Mick Abrahams as important musicians to him. His first solo album was named after and includes a cover version of Jethro Tull's &quot;A New Day Yesterday&quot; from their album Stand Up.\n\n \nBonamassa, performing in Stafford, Texas, 2007, laborated further on his influences in the interview:\n\n&quot;You know, my heroes were the columbine guys Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Paul Kossoff, Peter Green, Eric Clapton. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so many Ã¢â‚¬â€œ thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gary Moore, Rory Gallagher Ã¢â‚¬â€œ another Irish musician who played the same things, but don't tell him that. But those guys were my guys Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page. There's a certain sophistication to their approach to the blues that I really like, more so than the American blues that I was listening to. B.B. King's a big influence Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he's probably my biggest traditional influence. I love Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson and T-Bone Walker and stuff like that, but I couldn't sit down. I was always forcing myself to listen to whole records by them, where I'd rather listen to Humble Pie do &quot;I'm Ready&quot; than Muddy Waters, you know? I think, the English interpretation of the blues just hit me a lot better, you know?&quot;\n\n\nIn his October 2008 interview with Express &amp; Star:\n\n&quot;When I heard Kossoff playing &quot;Mr. Big&quot; and when I heard Clapton playing &quot;Crossroads&quot; and when I heard Rory Gallagher playing &quot;Cradle Rock&quot;, I was like, 'This is way cooler'.... &quot;British blues are my thing. When I heard Rod Stewart and the Jeff Beck Group singing &quot;Let Me Love You&quot;, it changed my life. I knew exactly what I wanted to do. Those are my influences&quot;.\nAnd in his December 2012 interview with MusicRadar:\n\n&quot;My friends would ask me, 'Have you heard the new Van Halen record?' And I'd be like, 'Nope.' I was listening to Frank Marino and Mahogany Rush&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:172422cd96b99802e83ea4a2046fdc2549f33d2a","amp;dn":"Joe+Bonamassa+-+Different+Shades+Of+Blue+%5B2014%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"172422cd96b99802e83ea4a2046fdc2549f33d2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,36,34,205,150,185,152,2,232,62,164,162,4,111,220,37,73,243,61,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
