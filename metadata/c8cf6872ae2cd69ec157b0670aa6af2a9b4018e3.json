From the mangrove swamp, where they get the wretched sustenance, Cannibal zombies emerge. Nobody knows the cause of this ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcontaminationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The important thing is to run and survive, to run again. With every bite, parents, friends and brothers, become awful creatures.\n\nIn front of a horror that doesn't move back, not even with the daylight, that doesn't exempt fish or crustaceans, an obstinate and fearful survivor is revealed, skillful with the axe and terrible when the moment comes to declare to the brunet who makes his heart beat.&quot;\n\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
