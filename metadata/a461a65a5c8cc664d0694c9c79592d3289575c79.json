The band has sold more than 60 million albums since 1979.[citation needed]\n\nThe core of the band is the two remaining founder members - Jim Kerr (vocals, songwriting) and Charlie Burchill (guitars, keyboards after 1990, other instruments, songwriting) - and drummer Mel Gaynor (who first joined the band in 1982). The other current band members are Andy Gillespie (keyboards) and Ged Grimes (bass guitar). Significant former members include bass guitarist Derek Forbes and keyboard player Michael MacNeil (the latter credited as a significant band composer during the band's rise in the 1980s). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Best Of Simple Minds 2001\n\nThe Best Of Simple Minds is the second greatest hits album by Simple Minds, released in 2001. New versions of the 'Theme for Great Cities' were released, and some copies (such as the U.S. version), included the remixes by Raven Maize. A new edition was released in November 2007 with an extra DVD of the Verona concert film.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nDisc 1 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Don't You (Forget About Me)&quot; - 4:20\n2.\t&quot;Promised You A Miracle&quot; (Edit) - 3:59\n3.\t&quot;Waterfront&quot; - 4:49\n4.\t&quot;Alive And Kicking&quot; - 5:24\n5.\t&quot;Glittering Prize&quot; (Edit) - 3:58\n6.\t&quot;All The Things She Said&quot; - 4:16\n7.\t&quot;Sanctify Yourself&quot; - 5:00\n8.\t&quot;Someone Somewhere (In Summertime)&quot; - 4:38\n9.\t&quot;Ghost Dancing&quot; - 4:46\n10.\t&quot;Up On The Catwalk&quot; (Edit) - 4:04\n11.\t&quot;Speed Your Love To Me&quot; (Edit) - 3:59\n12.\t&quot;Theme For Great Cities&quot; - 5:50\n13.\t&quot;Love Song&quot; (Edit) - 3:54\n14.\t&quot;The American&quot; (Edit) - 3:32\n15.\t&quot;Sweat In Bullet&quot; - 4:30\n16.\t&quot;Life In A Day&quot; - 4:00\n17.\t&quot;I Travel&quot; - 3:56\n\n\n\nDisc 2 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Let There Be Love&quot; (Extended Album Mix) - 5:14\n2.\t&quot;This Is Your Land&quot; (DJ Version) - 5:05\n3.\t&quot;Kick It In&quot; (Edit) - 4:20\n4.\t&quot;Let It All Come Down&quot; (Edit) - 3:37\n5.\t&quot;See The Lights&quot; - 4:22\n6.\t&quot;Stand By Love&quot; - 4:04\n7.\t&quot;Real Life&quot; (Video Mix) - 4:53\n8.\t&quot;She's A River&quot; (Edit) - 4:29\n9.\t&quot;Hypnotised&quot; (Edit) - 4:46\n10.\t&quot;Glitterball&quot; (Edit) - 4:25\n11.\t&quot;War Babies&quot; (Edit) - 4:24\n12.\t&quot;Mandela Day&quot; - 5:41\n13.\t&quot;Biko&quot; - 7:32\n14.\t&quot;Belfast Child&quot; - 6:40\n15.\t&quot;The Real Life&quot; (Remix) - 2:55\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a461a65a5c8cc664d0694c9c79592d3289575c79","amp;dn":"Simple+Minds+-+The+Best+Of+2001+%28Greatest+Hits%29+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a461a65a5c8cc664d0694c9c79592d3289575c79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,97,166,90,92,140,198,100,208,105,76,156,121,89,45,50,137,87,92,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
