Exposing the thinking, the money trail and the puppet strings behind the world-changing crises and wars of the last four decades, The Shock Doctrine is the gripping story of how AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ''free market'' policies have come to dominate the world-- through the exploitation of disaster-shocked people and countries.\n\nAt the most chaotic juncture in IraqÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s civil war, a new law is unveiled that would allow Shell and BP to claim the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vast oil reservesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. Immediately following September 11, the Bush Administration quietly out-sources the running of the ''War on Terror'' to Halliburton and BlackwaterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. After a tsunami wipes out the coasts of Southeast Asia, the pristine beaches are auctioned off to tourist resorts.... New OrleansÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s residents, scattered from Hurricane Katrina, discover that their public housing, hospitals and schools will never be reopenedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. These events are examples of ''the shock doctrine'': using the publicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s disorientation following massive collective shocks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ wars, terrorist attacks, or natural disasters -- to achieve control by imposing economic shock therapy. Sometimes, when the first two shocks donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t succeed in wiping out resistance, a third shock is employed: the electrode in the prison cell or the Taser gun on the streets.\n\nNaomi Klein (born May 8, 1970) is a Canadian author and social activist known for her political analyses and criticism of corporate globalization.\n\n\nRunning Time: 9:03:55\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.naomiklein.org/themes/shockdoctrine/img/logo.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.naomiklein.org/themes/shockdoctrine/img/logo.png&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3dafb1839948b846112211ba14549bcce968bf8","amp;dn":"Naomi+Klein+-+The+Shock+Doctrine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3dafb1839948b846112211ba14549bcce968bf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,218,251,24,57,148,139,132,97,18,33,27,161,69,73,188,206,150,139,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
