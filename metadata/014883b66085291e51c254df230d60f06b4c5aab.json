With support for Next-Gen H.265 &amp; 4K. Color grading is an essential tool for making impressions, telling stories, and evoking responses from your video viewers. In ColorDirector this pro-level editing technique is available in an intuitive suite that makes it simple for anyone to master.\n\nFeatures :\n\nPopular Film-Style Grades\nColorDirector comes with a range of built-in, professionally designed presets that emulate the styles of well-known films. You can also save any manual adjustments you make to a video as a preset and use it again on future projects. You can also download a huge collection of free presetsÃ¢â‚¬â€including presets made using both ColorDirector &amp; PhotoDirectorÃ¢â‚¬â€on DirectorZone.\n\nHDR Video: From Ordinary to Extraordinary\nApply HDR to your videos to add more dynamic range to your scenes, bring out the detail and highlight the best parts of your footage.\n\nHDR is perfect for landscape scenes where thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lot of contrast between the sky and the land and you want to capture the skyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s detail without making the land look too dark, scenes of people in harsh sunlight where there can be too much bright glare and dark shadows, and even low-light scenes where you need to brighten the foreground.\n\nSplit Toning for Video (NEW!)\nSplit toning involves adding a color to the shadows and highlights of a video. It's an old photography technique, but is a more recent (and very effective) addition to the video editorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s toolkit. It's a great way to evoke a certain feeling from your video footage, or even achieve a dramatic effect that leaves a lasting impression with your watchers.\n\nTinting Your Video (NEW!)\nApplying tints is an easy way to change the mood of your video. A cold wash of blue can make a video look cooler or more atmospheric, while a warm sepia tint can give a video a retro romantic look. It's also a great way to get that digital-green Matrix look. To effectively use tinting in your videos, try to apply a subtle tint that keeps the brightest whites and darkest shadows un-tinted.\n\nIntelligent Motion Tracking\nColorDirector's intelligent motion tracking algoritm tracks motion by matching image data from a selected area in a frame to image data in each succeeding frame, so you can isolate objects, accurately track their movements and of course change or enhance their color.\n\nEasy Color Replacement\nAn easy-to-use eye dropper is used to select any color in a video you want to replace. You can also click in the Original Color section and choose the color you want to replace.\n\nLook-up Table (LUT) Conversion\nLUTs are useful for matching footage from one source to another, for visual effect, or for output previewing. ColorDirector supports .3dl, .mga, .m3d, .cube and .csp format LUT files.\n\nPrecise Selection Masks\nThe Selection Mask can be used to precisely isolate any image in a frame for color grading and then, on a frame-by-frame level, track that object's motion over time.\n\nRound-trip Editing with PowerDirector\nFor an optimal video editing workflow and to cut down on your video editing time, use PowerDirector to import and edit your raw video footage, launch ColorDirector directly from PowerDirectorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interface for color grading, then send the footage back to PowerDirector for video rendering and production.\n\nAnd with the 64-bit, TrueVelocity 4-powered color grading engine, ColorDirector can handle even the highest quality 4K video files with ease.\n\nPopular Format Support incl. H.265 (NEW!)\nImport a wide range of popular formats for recorded video, including MP4, WMV, FLV, AVI, MPEG-2, AVCHD, ultra high def 4K files and now next-gen H.265 video.\n\n64-bit TrueVelocity 4 Grading Engine\nColorDirector offers native 64-bit support and the award-winning TrueVelocity editing engine for improved system efficiency and faster loading of HD video footage.\n\nAutomatic Scene Detection\nColorDirector detects the individual scenes contained within a video clip, separates them into multiple clips then adds them to the storyboard panel like any other video clip.\n\nCloud Services for your Video Projects (NEW!)\nIntegration of the new CyberLink Cloud service in ColorDirector means you can save videos, color grading projects, and back-up settings information to the cloud so that you can access and download them whenever and wherever you need them.\n\nGrade &quot;A&quot; Videos Improve &amp; Enhance Color &amp; Lighting Problems\nColorDirector comes with a complete set of tools to correct white balance, adjust tonality, and reduce artifact noise within your videos. All the professional tools you need to get your videos looking better.\n\nWhat's New :\n\n- Fixes issues with signing-in to DirectorZone when a password includes symbols.\n- Fixes a hanging error when importing some .MP4 and H.264 AVCHD files.\n- Resolves crashes for IE 11 users signing into DirectorZone or YouTube.\n- Resolves missing video preview when using Ã¢â‚¬Å“Split View ModeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in Trim or Scene Detection","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:014883b66085291e51c254df230d60f06b4c5aab","amp;dn":"CyberLink+ColorDirector+Ultra+3.0.3507.3+ML+%2B+Patch+-+AppzDam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"014883b66085291e51c254df230d60f06b4c5aab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,72,131,182,96,133,41,30,81,194,84,223,35,13,96,240,107,76,90,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
