Extract\n2. Play\n\n\nOfficial Alpha 4 Release Notes\n------------------------------\nAdded\n\n    Added scrap metal recipes from candy tins, air filters, and hub caps\n    Added new feature for preview position and rotation for placing blocks. Before placing a block a semi-transparent preview of the block is displayed and player can rotate it using LMB\n    Added Femur bone clubcrafting item\n    Added Hunting Knife\n    Added Bone Shiv\n    Added recipe for bone shiv\n    Added recipe for hunting knife\n    Added femur to zombie &amp; deer loot\n    Added hunting knife to loot\n    Added new block rotate sound set\n    TheÃ¢â‚¬Å“empty glassÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ can now also be filled with water at toilets\n\nChanges\n\n    Reduced polygon density on the barbed wire fence trap, candy tin landmine, hub cap landmine and air filter landmine for better performance and to keep people from reaching max vertices in a chunk\n    When pressing the ALT key in 3rd person the camera can be moved freely around the player. Old state was: when shooting it was shot through the screen middle. New state: the crosshair is removed and shooting is done along the players view\n    When the Z menu is opened, the full text search is auto selected and the old entered text is cleared\n    Increased time that zombies play their roam sounds\n    Increased block damage on explosions to allow better TNT chain reactions\n    The turn speed of entities (like zombies or stag) is now dependent on their speed: the faster they move the faster they turn\n    Increased colliders for inventory slots so that horizontally there is no space any more. Vertically there is still a small gap in the bag\n    Spikes can now be placed only on a solid cube. So stacking of spikes isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t possible\n\nBug Fixes\n\n    Fixed problem that chunk could not be saved when building a column &gt; 190 blocks\n    Configure Controls: fixed bug that Ã¢â‚¬Å“left shiftÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“right shiftÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ were not selectable\n    Fixed problem that when placing a bedroll/bed the other block was removed without a check. This could be abused for fast mining. Also set the orientation of a bed correctly\n    Fixed problem that when running a server for a long time and the entity ids get greater than 16 bit, no player was able to connect to the server any more\n    Added delay to food items so they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t disappear until used\n\n--===VIPER666===--","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:528ba53fda090f874f8629a72ea126c0ba5daf71","amp;dn":"7+Days+to+Die+Alpha+4+x86+Cracked+%5BVIPER666%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"528ba53fda090f874f8629a72ea126c0ba5daf71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,139,165,63,218,9,15,135,79,134,41,167,46,161,38,192,186,93,175,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
