Like the first American edition of 1934, it also contains the original foreword by the author and the historic court ruling by Judge John M. Woolsey to remove the federal ban on the book. It also contains page references to the 1934 edition, which are indicated in the margins.\n\nIn the past, Ulysses has been labeled dirty, blasphemous, and even unreadable. None of these adjectives, however, do the slightest justice to the novel. To this day it remains the modernist masterpiece, in which the author takes both Celtic lyricism and vulgarity to splendid extremes. It is funny, sorrowful, and even (in a close-focus sort of way) suspenseful. And despite the exegetical industry that has sprung up in the last 75 years, Ulysses is also a compulsively readable book.\n\n\nMore information:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.69books.com/2015/07/james-joyce-ulysses.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.69books.com/2015/07/james-joyce-ulysses.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31d1b2f5ea49e5988d525021dd6a2289be9d9a6c","amp;dn":"James+Joyce%3A+Ulysses+pdf%2C+epub%2C+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31d1b2f5ea49e5988d525021dd6a2289be9d9a6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,209,178,245,234,73,229,152,141,82,80,33,221,106,34,137,190,157,154,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
