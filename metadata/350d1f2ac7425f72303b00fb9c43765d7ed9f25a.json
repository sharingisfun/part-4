He became interested in a range of music: My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive, Tangerine Dream, Chapterhouse, and early bleep &amp; breakbeat tracks. There was not much opportunity to see his musical influences in Kiel, so he moved to Berlin in 1996.\n\n    Ulrich's musical output began under the pseudonyms of View to the Future and Ethereal 77. These electronica and drum-driven pieces were noticed by Berlin electronica label CCO (City Centre Offices), to which Schnauss sent CD's on a regular basis. Ulrich developed these submissions to CCO into his first album under his own name, Far Away Trains Passing By, released in Europe in 2001, and in the United States in 2005.\n\n    His next album, 2003's A Strangely Isolated Place, showed the influence of My Bloody Valentine's Kevin Shields and Cocteau Twins' Robin Guthrie. Schnauss has said of this album, &quot;When you've worked with computers and keyboards for a number of years, they become not so fascinating of themselves anymore. I gained confidence after people began to discover Far Away Trains Passing By, and it hasn't really stopped since then. This time I decided not to compromise on what I wanted to do, with what I thought people might want me to do.&quot;\n\n    Since the release of both albums Ulrich has been asked to work with and remix with artists, including Port-Royal, Mojave 3, Televise, Long-view, Johannes Schmoelling, The Zephyrs, Lunz (Rodelius), and others.\n\n    He also plays keyboards for UK indie band Long-view, whose singer Rob McVey was featured on Ulrich's latest album Goodbye. In an interview he said: &quot; I have always loved music that has both elements: melancholy and sadness as a description of the current situation you are in, but at the same time a hopeful, utopian element that reminds you of the possibility of a different life.&quot;\n\n-wikipedia\n\n     .-.     .-.     .-.     .-.     .-.     .-.     .-.\n`._.'   `._.'   `._.'   `._.'   `._.'   `._.'   `._.'   `._.'\n\n\nRelease Notes [&gt;Please Read&lt;]:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢I seem to be missing two(2)tracks from the album &quot;Quicksand Memory.&quot;\n Missing tracks: &quot;Look At The Sky (Rob McVey Version)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:45\n                 &quot;Medusa (Edit)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢I did NOT rip these myself. I acquired the FLAC format of the albums &quot;Far Away Trains Passing By,&quot; and &quot;A Strangely Isolated Place&quot; legally, and since no one has uploaded them I have decided to do so.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢The album &quot;Goodbye&quot; was not ripped by me, but obtained through TPB.
