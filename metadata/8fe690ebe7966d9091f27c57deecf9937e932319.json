The Lord ChancellorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deciding vote will cast a long shadow on the lives of Harry Clifton and Giles Barrington. Harry returns to America to promote his latest novel, while his beloved Emma goes in search of the little girl who was found abandoned in her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s office on the night he was killed. When the General Election is called, Giles Barrington has to defend his seat in the House of Commons and is horrified to discover who the Conservatives select to stand against him.\nBut it is Sebastian Clifton, Harry and EmmaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s son, who ultimately influences his uncleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fate. In 1957, Sebastian wins a scholarship to Cambridge, and a new generation of the Clifton family march onto the page. After Sebastian is expelled from school, he unwittingly becomes caught up in an international art fraud involving a Rodin statue that is worth far more than the sum it raises at auction.\n\nDoes he become a millionaire? Does he go to Cambridge? Is his life in danger?\n\nBest Kept Secret will answer all these questions, but once again, pose so many more.\n\n\n\nThis is a multi-tracker torrent.
