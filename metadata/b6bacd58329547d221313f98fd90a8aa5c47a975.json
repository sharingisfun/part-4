A curious, organic artifact falls from the starry sky and inexplicably, without asking permission, transports you across the universe. Youâ€™ve been abducted from your cozy existence and added into an alien landscape with a stereotypical Kansas farmhouse, a white picket fence, and a rather bizarre little ghost town - wellâ€¦ almost ghost town. Adding to the oddity, you discover a strangely kluged kiosk that reassuringly welcomes you to Hunrath.\r\n\r\nFor more info go to : https://www.gog.com/game/obduction\r\n\r\n-Install\r\n-Play","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6bacd58329547d221313f98fd90a8aa5c47a975","amp;dn":"Obduction.%282.0.0.3%29-GOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6bacd58329547d221313f98fd90a8aa5c47a975","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,186,205,88,50,149,71,210,33,49,63,152,253,144,168,170,92,71,169,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
