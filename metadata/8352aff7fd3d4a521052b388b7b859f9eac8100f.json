After failing to deliver knock-out blows at Stalingrad and Moscow, his army was now at the mercy of the vast Soviet war machine. With its huge resources and seemingly limitless numbers of men, the Red Army slowly pushed the Germans back out of Russia through Ukraine, Poland, the Balkans and Hungary. This was war on a monster scale, pitching armies of millions against each other. But it was also a war fought by small bands of partisans, men like Tito in Yugoslavia, leading guerrilla bands against Nazi forces.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2016 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 608x352\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.727:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 51:27.720\nNumber Of Parts: 13\nPart Size: 855,058,432 Bytes\nRipped by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8352aff7fd3d4a521052b388b7b859f9eac8100f","amp;dn":"Discovery.Channel.World.War.II.In.HD.Colour.08of13.The.Soviet.St","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8352aff7fd3d4a521052b388b7b859f9eac8100f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,82,175,247,253,61,74,82,16,82,179,136,183,184,89,249,234,200,16,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
