Relatively less attention is paid to the design and operation of food processing equipment, which is necessary to carry out all of the food processes in the food plant. Significant technical advances on processing equipment have been made by the manufacturers, as evidenced by the efficient modem food proÃ‚Â­ cessing plants. There is a need to relate advances in process engineering to procÃ‚Â­ ess equipment, and vice versa. This book is an attempt to apply the established principles of transport pheÃ‚Â­ nomena and unit operations to the design, selection, and operation of food proÃ‚Â­ cessing equipment. Since food processing equipment is still designed empiriÃ‚Â­ cally, due to the complexity of the processes and the uncertainty of food properties, description of some typical industrial units is necessary to understand the operating characteristics. Approximate values and data are used for illustraÃ‚Â­ tive purposes, since there is an understandable lack of published industrial data","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c8722bb227c836915cdd6846441145701d6b4e0","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Food+Processing+Equipment","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c8722bb227c836915cdd6846441145701d6b4e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,135,34,187,34,124,131,105,21,205,214,132,100,65,20,87,1,214,180,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
