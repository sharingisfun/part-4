Rising to No. 1 the world over and ultimately selling over 30 million copies worldwide, Nevermind would come to be much more than one of the most successful and influential albums of its or any era.\nAs the album that returned unaffected rock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ roll integrity and passion to the top of the charts, Nevermind would prove a singular inspiration to fans and musicians alike over the last two decades--and will undoubtedly do so for generations to come.\nThe 20th anniversary reissue of Nevermind sees a full spectrum re-release worthy of such a pivotal classic.\nThe original album has been remastered along with the accompanying studio and live B-sides. The bonus material includes dozens of previously unreleased recordings, obscure B-sides, alternate mixes, radio sessions, studio rarities and live recordings, plus a 1991 Halloween concert at Seattle's Paramount Theatre in its entirety\n\n[img]http://i896.photobucket.com/albums/ac169/pbf99/tr.gif[/img]\n\nDisc One\n\n    * 1.
