Players can lay track (including tunnels and overpasses), pick from over 40 locomotives from early steams to modern bullets, choose to haul over 35 types of cargo in a dynamic economy, and participate in an advanced stock market.\r\nThe new 3-D engine takes the franchise to the next level, allowing smooth scaling from an 'eye in the sky' view of an entire continent down to super detailed close-up of a beautifully modeled train, building, or just the landscape. Railroad Tycoon 3 also includes more multiplayer support than its predecessor, integrating an on-line chat and matchmaking service. To top everything off, the game's soundtrack features another installment of some of the best authentic blues, bluegrass, and Americana music around.\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: XP / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10\r\nProcessor: 1.4GHz Intel Pentium 4 or AMD Athlon processor or equivalent \r\nMemory: 512 MB RAM \r\nGraphics: 64 MB Video card with hardware pixel and vertex shaders (GeForce 3, Radeon 8500 or better) \r\nSound card: DirectX 9.0 compatible sound card \r\nHard Drive: 1.7 GB of free disc drive space","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1f750f3b64af98973a52456a351d95fee59de6e","amp;dn":"Railroad+Tycoon+3+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1f750f3b64af98973a52456a351d95fee59de6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,247,80,243,182,74,249,137,115,165,36,86,163,81,217,95,238,89,222,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
