It introduces elementary probability theory and stochastic processes, and shows how probability theory can be applied fields such as engineering, computer science, management science, the physical and social sciences, and operations research.\n\nThe hallmark features of this renowned text remain in this eleventh edition: superior writing style; excellent exercises and examples covering the wide breadth of coverage of probability topic; and real-world applications in engineering, science, business and economics. The 65% new chapter material includes coverage of finite capacity queues, insurance risk models, and Markov chains, as well as updated data.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPreface\nIntroduction to Probability Theory\nRandom Variables\nConditional Probability and Conditional Expectation\nMarkov Chains\nThe Exponential Distribution and the Poisson Process\nContinuous-Time Markov Chains\nRenewal Theory and Its Applications\nQueueing Theory\nReliability Theory\nBrownian Motion and Stationary Processes\nSimulation\nAppendix: Solutions to Starred Exercises\nIndex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:847212b31ed07a5a7bfe137c9d4542ccddaf781e","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Probability+Models%2C+11th+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"847212b31ed07a5a7bfe137c9d4542ccddaf781e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,114,18,179,30,208,122,90,123,254,19,124,157,69,66,204,221,175,120,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
