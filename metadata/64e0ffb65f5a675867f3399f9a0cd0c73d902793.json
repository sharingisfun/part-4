You bet everything on it. You were certain that Ã¢â‚¬Å“the rest of the guysÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ also known as the band, were going to drown in that metaphorical water under the bridge. How could you replace the charisma and the swagger of Scott?  At best maybe Saliva would reincarnate somewhere down the road with a knockoff, half-ass front man who could pique some interest on the national fairground circuit by milking the old classics for every last creamy drop. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what you had bet on, remember? Maybe thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what I had bet on too.  UntilÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nEnter Bobby Amaru, with his young, energetic personality, rockstar good looks and the vocal range of a banshee with his ass on fire!  Amaru and Saliva teamed up almost immediately after ScottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s departure and hit the road without missing a beat.  Amaru won over fans right out of the starting gate, landing a sweet deal with the then newly-formed Bum Rum Records, and the first album, In It To Win It  (released 9/13/2013) was a chart-topping success.  \n\nNow, its time to double-down on the aforementioned bets, as Saliva comes back yet AGAIN Ã¢â‚¬â€œ packing a one/two knockout punch Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with their second offering of bad ass new material entitled Rise Up. With Amaru at the reins, Saliva started a fresh chapter but doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t burn the old book in any shape, form or fashion. Amaru brought along his own vocal style to a band with a recognizable and well established sound which has brought forth a new incarnation that is here to stay. LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dive in, shall we?\n\nThe very first song and  title track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rise Up,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  is a high voltage tune that really gets the blood flowinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, accompanied by a video that surely will put you in the mood to riot.  The track is certainly the anthem of the record and reiterates that Saliva is still very much alive and prepared to kick unlimited assÃ¢â‚¬Â¦until infinity perhaps!\n\nRise Up is twelve tracks saturated in sustained energy from start to finish and gives the vibe of a collective creative effort, proving once again that Saliva is still as viable today as they were in the past.  And the future looks pretty fucking awesome! \n\nSALIVA is:  Bobby Amaru- (vocals), Wayne Swinny Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (Lead Guitar), Dave Novotny Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (Bass), Paul Crosby Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (Drums)\n\nTrack Listing\n1.
