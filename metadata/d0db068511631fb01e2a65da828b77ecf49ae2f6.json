(A Blitz of Salt-N-Pepa Hits: The Hits Remixed does not count, and 2000s The Best of Salt-N-Pepa wasn't distributed in the States.) Released in 2008, this disc doesn't contain anything from Salt-N-Pepa's last album, 1997's Brand New, but it features almost every significant single from their first four. That said, two of the best tracks from Blacks' Magic, &quot;You Showed Me&quot; and &quot;Do You Want Me&quot; (a number seven rap single that seemed nearly as ubiquitous as &quot;Push It&quot; for a couple months during 1991), are missing -- bound to be an issue for some. Do give the compilers some credit for tapping &quot;My Mic Sounds Nice.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0db068511631fb01e2a65da828b77ecf49ae2f6","amp;dn":"20th+Century+Masters%3A+The+Best+of+Salt-N-Pepa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0db068511631fb01e2a65da828b77ecf49ae2f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,219,6,133,17,99,31,176,30,42,101,218,130,139,119,236,244,154,226,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
