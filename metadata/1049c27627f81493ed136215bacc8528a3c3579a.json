Frank, Areg Grigorian \r\nFormat: PDF \r\nHardcover: 723 pages \r\nPublisher: Springer; 2015 edition (January 11, 2015) \r\nLanguage: English \r\nISBN: 9781493917259 \r\n\r\n\r\nSurgery: A Case Based Clinical Review provides the reader with a comprehensive understanding of surgical diseases in one easy to use reference that combines multiple teaching formats. The book begins using a case based approach. The cases presented cover the diseases most commonly encountered on a surgical rotation. The cases are designed to provide the reader with the classic findings on history and physical examination. The case presentation is followed by a series of short questions and answers, designed to provide further understanding of the important aspects of the history, physical examination, differential diagnosis, diagnostic work-up and management, as well as questions that may arise on surgical rounds. Key figures and tables visually reinforce the important elements of the disease process. A brief algorithmic flow chart is provided so the reader can quickly understand the optimal management approach. Two additional special sections further strengthen the studentâ€™s comprehension. The first section covers areas of controversy in the diagnosis or management of each disease, and another section discusses pitfalls to avoid, where the inexperienced clinician might get in trouble. The text concludes with a series of multiple choice questions in a surgery shelf/USMLE format with robust explanations. Surgery: A Case Based Clinical Review is based on 20 years of Socratic medical student teaching by a nine-time Golden Apple teaching awardee from the UCLA School of Medicine and will be of great utility for medical students when they rotate on surgery, interns, physician assistant students, nursing students and nurse practitioner students","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1049c27627f81493ed136215bacc8528a3c3579a","amp;dn":"Surgery%3A+A+Case+Based+Clinical+Review+%5B2015%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1049c27627f81493ed136215bacc8528a3c3579a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,73,194,118,39,248,20,147,237,19,98,21,186,204,133,40,163,195,87,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
