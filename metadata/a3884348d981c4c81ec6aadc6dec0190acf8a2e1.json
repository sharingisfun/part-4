The group, formed by Aaron Turner of Isis and Santos Montano, has now expanded to become a sort of supergroup in the Boston hardcore and metalcore scene. The group is less a band than it is a recording project for a variety of talent. By the release of their first album (Meditations in B), Old Man Gloom expanded to include two new members.\n\nBiography\nIn 2001, a year after the release of Meditations in B, the band released two albums simultaneously: Seminar II and Seminar III. For these records, Luke Scarola joined to use electronics. On Seminar II, Stephen Brodsky of Cave In wrote the lyrics for one song, and Jay Randall of Agoraphobic Nosebleed contributed on electronics.\nOn August 24, 2004, Christmas was released. In 2011, Old Man Gloom recorded NO with Kurt Ballou and released the album on June 26, 2012. In 2012, Old Man Gloom began playing live performances again, after an extended period of inactivity. In August 2014 new album Ape Of God was announced with its release date on November 11, 2014. Documentary Here is a Gift for You directed by Kenneth Thomas would be released sometime in the fall aswell.\n\n\nimage\nBand Members:\n\nCaleb Scofield Bass, Vocals\nSantos Montano Drums\nNate Newton Guitars, Vocals\nAaron Turner Guitars, Vocals\n\n\n\nDiscography:\n\nMeditations in B (1999)\nSeminar II: The Holy Rites of Primitivism Regressionism (2001)\nSeminar III: Zozobra (2001)\nChristmas Eve I and II + 6 (2003)\nChristmas (2004)\nNo (2012)\nThe Ape Of God (2014)\n\n\n\nThe Ape Of God (2014)\n\nimage\n\nDisc 1\n\n01 - Eden's Gates\n02 - Promise\n03 - Shoulder Meat\n04 - Fist Of Fury\n05 - Simia Dei\n06 - The Lash\n07 - Never Enter\n08 - After You're Dead\n\nDisc 2\n\n01 - Burden\n02 - Predators\n03 - A Hideous Nightmare Lies Upon The World\n04 - Arrows To Our Hearts\n\n\n\n\nGenre: Sludge\nSubgenre: Sludge Metal / Ambient / Noise\nBitrate: 320 k\nSize: 207.81 MB\nShow/Hide Files:\n13 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3884348d981c4c81ec6aadc6dec0190acf8a2e1","amp;dn":"+Old+Man+Gloom+-+The+Ape+Of+God+%282CD%29+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3884348d981c4c81ec6aadc6dec0190acf8a2e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,136,67,72,217,129,196,200,30,198,170,220,109,236,1,144,172,248,162,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
