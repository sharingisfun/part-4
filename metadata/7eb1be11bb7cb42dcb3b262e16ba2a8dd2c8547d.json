He almost sets out to do so.\nBut therein lies the genius.\nYour not walking away just entertained, your walking away educated.\n\nHe has never done it better than in this DVD.\nHe covers topics like, Abortions, Freedom of Speech, Transvestites,\nand yes he still talks about how much he hates babies.\n\nHe is on top form in this DVD and as the show goes to a close you will\nknow what his message is. I gave this DVD a ten not because it is rated\nfor all audiences, but because this is very good comedy.\nI have seen many stand-up DVD&amp;#039;s and no-one gives such a performance as\nhe does.\n\nEnjoy !!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7eb1be11bb7cb42dcb3b262e16ba2a8dd2c8547d","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Doug+Stanhope+-+Deadbeat+Hero","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7eb1be11bb7cb42dcb3b262e16ba2a8dd2c8547d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,177,190,17,187,124,180,45,203,59,38,46,22,186,42,141,210,200,84,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
