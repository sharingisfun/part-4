The group was formed in Toronto in 1985 by Margo Timmins (vocalist), Michael Timmins (songwriter, guitarist), Peter Timmins (drummer) and Alan Anton (bassist).\n\nThe Junkies first performed publicly at the Beverley Tavern and other clubs in Toronto's Queen Street West, including The Rivoli. Their 1986 debut album, produced by Canadian producer Peter Moore, was the blues-inspired Whites Off Earth Now!!, recorded using an ambisonic microphone in the family garage.[1]\n\nThe group's fame spread with their second album, The Trinity Session, recorded in 1987 at Toronto's Church of the Holy Trinity. Their sound, again using the ambisonic microphone, and their mix of blues, country, folk, rock and jazz earned them both critical attention and a cult following. The Los Angeles Times named the recording as one of the ten best albums of 1988.[1]\n\nThe band was nominated for Group of the Year at the Juno Awards in 1990 and 1991. In the early 1990s Margo Timmins was named &quot;one of the fifty most beautiful people in the world&quot; by People Magazine. The group has continued to tour North America, Europe, Japan and Australia with extensive North American and European tours following album releases in 2002 and 2004.[1] In 2008, they released Trinity Revisited in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the original recording of The Trinity Session. \n\nThe band was formed by three siblings from the Timmins entertainment family. Another sibling, Cali, rose to fame as an actress on Ryan's Hope. (The Timmins siblings are descendants of Noah Timmins, a mining prospector who founded the Ontario city of Timmins.)\n\nCowboy Junkies formed in Toronto in 1985. The band's name was chosen randomly as they approached their first gig.[citation needed]\n\nThe Trinity Session was recorded live on a single Calrec stereo microphone at the Church of the Holy Trinity in downtown Toronto by producer Peter J. Moore. This album also included a cover of The Velvet Underground's &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; based on the 1969 Live album version rather than the studio version from Loaded. The single featured in the films Natural Born Killers and The Good Girl.\n\nNone of the band's subsequent albums have been hits outside of Canada, although the band has maintained a dedicated following and have continued to have chart hits in their native country. Following their 1998 album Miles from Our Home, Cowboy Junkies agreed to leave Geffen Records. They have continued to release albums on their own independent label, Latent Recordings, with distribution through other labels such as Rounder in the USA and Cooking Vinyl in the UK.\n\nIn June 2007, Cowboy Junkies performed alongside the Boston Pops at Boston Symphony Hall conducted by Keith Lockhart. The program was titled Edgefest.\n\nIn 2007 they released Trinity Revisited, a re-recording of the album featuring guest artists Ryan Adams, Vic Chesnutt, Natalie Merchant and Jeff Bird. Both the album and the film Trinity Revisited were filmed and produced by Pierre and FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois Lamoureux. On 9 November 2007, CBC Television aired Trinity Revisited: featuring Cowboy Junkies, which was recorded as the band recorded the new album.\n\n\n\n\nWhites Off Earth Now!! 1986\n\n\nWhites Off Earth Now!! is a 1986 album by Cowboy Junkies. It was the band's debut album, and is composed almost entirely of rock and blues covers. Only one song, &quot;Take Me&quot;, is an original song by the band. It establishes the spare country blues sound that took the band to international fame with their next album, 1988's The Trinity Session. Sadly due to the success of The Trinity Session this equally compelling and at times truly hypnotic album has received far less critical attention over the years. The album was released on Latent Records in 1986, and rereleased internationally on RCA Records in 1991. On March 27, 2007 audiophile label Mobile Fidelity reissued the album on SACD and high density vinyl.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Shining Moon&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03, written by Lightnin' Hopkins\n2.\t&quot;State Trooper&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25, written by Bruce Springsteen\n3.\t&quot;Me and the Devil Blues&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:21, written by Robert Johnson\n4.\t&quot;Decoration Day&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53, written by John Lee Hooker\n5.\t&quot;Baby Please Don't Go&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:03, written by Big Joe Williams\n6.\t&quot;I'll Never Get Out of These Blues Alive&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:23, written by John Lee Hooker\n7.\t&quot;Take Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:29, written by Margo Timmins and Michael Timmins\n8.\t&quot;Forgive Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:25, written by John Lee Hooker\n9.\t&quot;Crossroads&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:18, written by Robert Johnson\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trinity Session 1988\n\n\nThe Trinity Session is a 1988 album by Cowboy Junkies, their second album. The music was recorded at Toronto, Ontario's Church of the Holy Trinity on November 27, 1987, with the band circled around a single microphone. The album includes a mixture of original material by the band and covers of classic folk, rock and country songs, including the band's most famous single, a cover of The Velvet Underground's &quot;Sweet Jane&quot;, based on the early version found on 1969: The Velvet Underground Live, rather than the well-known studio version from Loaded. Also included is &quot;Blue Moon Revisited (Song for Elvis)&quot;, which is both a cover and an original, combining a new song by the band with the pop standard &quot;Blue Moon&quot;. The album was released in early 1988 on Latent Records in Canada, and rereleased worldwide later in the year on RCA Records. &quot;Working on a Building&quot; and &quot;Blue Moon Revisited (Song for Elvis)&quot; did not appear on the Latent Records release. &quot;Blue Moon Revisited&quot; was originally released on It Came from Canada, Vol. 4, a compilation of Canadian independent bands.\n\nIn 2007 the album was performed live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow's Parties-curated Don't Look Back series. Also in that year, the band released a new 20th anniversary edition of the album, Trinity Revisited, with guest musicians Natalie Merchant, Vic Chesnutt and Ryan Adams.\n\nAccording to website Acclaimed Music,[4] the album is the 893rd most acclaimed album ever released. It was named the 42nd best album of the 1980s by Pitchfork Media in 2002 and the 36th best Canadian album by Chart in 2000. It was also ranked 62nd in Bob Mersereau's book The Top 100 Canadian Albums in 2007.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Mining for Gold&quot; (James Gordon) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:34\n2.\t&quot;Misguided Angel&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:58\n3.\t&quot;Blue Moon Revisited (Song for Elvis)&quot; (Margo and Michael Timmins; &quot;Blue Moon&quot; by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:31 (not included on the original Vinyl release, later included on Classic Records Vinyl release of RTH 8568)\n4.\t&quot;I Don't Get It&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34\n5.\t&quot;I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot; (Hank Williams) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:24\n6.\t&quot;To Love is to Bury&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:47\n7.\t&quot;200 More Miles&quot; (Michael Timmins) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:29\n8.\t&quot;Dreaming My Dreams with You&quot; (Allen Reynolds) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28\n9.\t&quot;Working on a Building&quot; (traditional) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:48 (not included on the original Vinyl release, later included on Classic Records Vinyl release of RTH 856)\n10.\t&quot;Sweet Jane&quot; (Lou Reed) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:41\n11.\t&quot;Postcard Blues&quot; (Michael Timmins) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:28\n12.\t&quot;Walkin' After Midnight&quot; (Don Hecht, Alan Block) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Caution Horses 1990\n\n\nThe Caution Horses is a 1990 album by the Canadian country rock band Cowboy Junkies. The first album following their 1988 breakthrough The Trinity Session, The Caution Horses features a more conventional, polished sound than that album's spare, haunting country blues. As a consequence, the album was savaged by music critics, who charged that the band had sacrificed their distinctive style. However, the album's accessibility to mainstream pop and rock audiences also meant that it received more radio airplay and spawned bigger chart hits (&quot;Sun Comes Up, It's Tuesday Morning&quot; and &quot;Rock and Bird&quot;, which featured Bruce Hornsby on the piano on the single version) than The Trinity Session had. A number of critics have also noted that while the album is undeniably a disappointment when compared to its predecessor, when taken on its own merits it is a better album than its initial reception would suggest.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Sun Comes Up, It's Tuesday Morning&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n2.\t&quot;Cause Cheap is How I Feel&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:13\n3.\t&quot;Thirty Summers&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15\n4.\t&quot;Mariner's Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:20\n5.\t&quot;Powderfinger&quot; (Neil Young) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:46\n6.\t&quot;Rock and Bird&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:03\n7.\t&quot;Witches&quot; (Michael Timmins, Margo Timmins) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:44\n8.\t&quot;Where Are You Tonight?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:28\n9.\t&quot;Escape is So Simple&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:15\n10.\t&quot;You Will Be Loved Again&quot; (Mary Margaret O'Hara) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Eyed Man  1992\n\nBlack Eyed Man is a 1992 album by Cowboy Junkies. The album continues the band's evolution from a spare country blues style (exemplified by 1988's The Trinity Session) to a more mainstream country rock style. However, the album was better received by critics than 1990's The Caution Horses. American songwriter Townes Van Zandt wrote &quot;Cowboy Junkies Lament&quot; especially for the band. Michael Timmins returned the favor, penning &quot;Townes' Blues&quot; as a tribute to Van Zandt. The band also cover Van Zandt's &quot;To Live is to Fly&quot; at the end of the album. John Prine appears as a guest vocalist on &quot;If You Were the Woman and I Was the Man.&quot;\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Southern Rain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:49\n2.\t&quot;Oregon Hill&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:53\n3.\t&quot;This Street, That Man, This Life&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:13\n4.\t&quot;A Horse in the Country&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:48\n5.\t&quot;If You Were the Woman and I Was the Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:11\n6.\t&quot;Murder, Tonight, in the Trailer Park&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:31\n7.\t&quot;Black Eyed Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:14\n8.\t&quot;Winter's Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:57\n9.\t&quot;The Last Spike&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22\n10.\t&quot;Cowboy Junkies Lament&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:06\n11.\t&quot;Townes' Blues&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10\n12.\t&quot;To Live is to Fly&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:52 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPale Sun Crescent Moon 1993\n\n\nPale Sun Crescent Moon is a 1993 album by Cowboy Junkies. Canadian guitarist Ken Myhr appears on every track on this album. It is generally viewed as the band's best 1990s work. As with all of the band's albums since 1988's The Trinity Session, however, it was only a modest success outside of the band's native Canada. It was the band's last album of new material for RCA Records, although a live album and a greatest hits compilation were subsequently released on the label.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Crescent Moon&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:02\n2.\t&quot;First Recollection&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16\n3.\t&quot;Ring on the Sill&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22\n4.\t&quot;Anniversary Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:11\n5.\t&quot;White Sail&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n6.\t&quot;Seven Years&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:54\n7.\t&quot;Pale Sun&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:39\n8.\t&quot;The Post&quot; (J Mascis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:40\n9.\t&quot;Cold Tea Blues&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:47\n10.\t&quot;Hard to Explain&quot; (Ray Agee) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37\n11.\t&quot;Hunted&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03\n12.\t&quot;Floorboard Blues&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLay It Down 1996\n\n\nLay it Down was a studio album by the Canadian band Cowboy Junkies. Released on February 27, 1996, it was the group's first album for Geffen Records after the end of their contract with RCA Records. It was the band's first album that could be described as straight-ahead rock, rather than country rock, country or blues. It was also their first album consisting entirely of original material, with no covers. &quot;A Common Disaster&quot; and &quot;Speaking Confidentially&quot; were notable hits for the band on Canadian radio. Like all their albums after The Trinity Session, however, it was only a modest success internationally. The album also includes two versions of the track &quot;Come Calling&quot;, which is presented in male and female versions representing two sides of a relationship of an elderly couple, dealing with the pain and anguish of Alzheimer's Disease. The &quot;Angel Mine&quot; music video featuring Janeane Garofalo, was filmed at The El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Something More Besides You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15\n2.\t&quot;A Common Disaster&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21\n3.\t&quot;Lay it Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22\n4.\t&quot;Hold on to Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22\n5.\t&quot;Come Calling (His Song)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n6.\t&quot;Just Want to See&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:23\n7.\t&quot;Lonely Sinking Feeling&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:24\n8.\t&quot;Angel Mine&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59\n9.\t&quot;Bea's Song (River Song Trilogy, Part II)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n10.\t&quot;Musical Key&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55\n11.\t&quot;Speaking Confidentially&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27\n12.\t&quot;Come Calling (Her Song)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:00\n13.\t&quot;Now I Know&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMiles From Our Home 1998\n\n\nMiles from Our Home is an album by Canadian rock band Cowboy Junkies, which was released in 1998. It was their second and final album for Geffen Records. Like all of their albums after 1988's The Trinity Session, it was only a modest success internationally. However, the title track was a significant hit in their native Canada. Following this album, the Junkies were dropped from the Geffen record label, a common occurrence in the late 1990s for bands and artists (most famously Aimee Mann) who had solid, loyal fan bases but did not enjoy multiplatinum sales.[citation needed] Like many such artists, the Junkies moved to an independent label, in this case Latent Records, for their subsequent albums.\n\nTracks:\n\n1.\t&quot;New Dawn Coming&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:12\n2.\t&quot;Blue Guitar&quot; (Michael Timmins, Townes Van Zandt) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:09\n3.\t&quot;Miles from Our Home&quot; (Michael Timmins, Greg Clarke, Brodie Lodge) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35\n4.\t&quot;Good Friday&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02\n5.\t&quot;Darkling Days&quot; (Michael Timmins, Greg Clarke) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:21\n6.\t&quot;Hollow as a Bone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26\n7.\t&quot;Someone Out There&quot; (Michael Timmins, Greg Clarke) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00\n8.\t&quot;The Summer of Discontent&quot; (Michael Timmins, Greg Clarke, Brodie Lodge) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35\n9.\t&quot;No Birds Today&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:19\n10.\t&quot;Those Final Feet&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:30 (including hidden track &quot;At the End of the Rainbow&quot;)\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen 2001\n\nOpen is an album by the Canada band Cowboy Junkies, released in 2001.

Each takes the lead vocal on one of the album's songs (Adams on &quot;200 More Miles&quot;, Merchant on &quot;To Love Is to Bury&quot; and Chesnutt on &quot;Postcard Blues&quot;), and shares vocal and musical duties on other tracks.

The album was also packaged with a performance film, Trinity Revisited, and a documentary film, Trinity Session Revisited, both by directors Pierre and FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois Lamoureux. In concerts to support the album, singer Thea Gilmore substituted for Merchant in some shows.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Mining for Gold&quot; (traditional)\n2.\t&quot;Misguided Angel&quot;\n3.\t&quot;Blue Moon Revisited (Song for Elvis)&quot; (Margo and Michael Timmins; &quot;Blue Moon&quot; by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart)\n4.\t&quot;I Don't Get It&quot;\n5.\t&quot;I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot; (Hank Williams)\n6.\t&quot;To Love is to Bury&quot;\n7.\t&quot;200 More Miles&quot; (Michael Timmins)\n8.\t&quot;Dreaming My Dreams with You&quot; (Allen Reynolds)\n9.\t&quot;Working on a Building&quot; (traditional)\n10.\t&quot;Sweet Jane&quot; (Lou Reed)\n11.\t&quot;Postcard Blues&quot; (Michael Timmins)\n12.\t&quot;Walkin' After Midnight&quot; (Don Hecht, Alan Block)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRenmin Park 2010\n\n\nRenmin Park is an album by the Canadian rock band Cowboy Junkies, released in 2010.

All songs are drawn from the band's RCA Records albums: The Trinity Session, The Caution Horses, Black Eyed Man and Pale Sun Crescent Moon.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n1.\t&quot;Sweet Jane&quot; (Lou Reed)\n2.\t&quot;Blue Moon Revisited (Song for Elvis)&quot;\n3.\t&quot;Anniversary Song&quot;\n4.\t&quot;This Street, That Man, This Life&quot;\n5.\t&quot;Misguided Angel&quot;\n6.\t&quot;A Horse in the Country&quot;\n7.\t&quot;The Post&quot;\n8.\t&quot;Murder, Tonight, in the Trailer Park&quot;\n9.\t&quot;I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot; (Hank Williams Sr)\n10.\t&quot;Seven Years&quot;\n11.\t&quot;Dreaming My Dreams With You&quot;\n12.\t&quot;Powderfinger&quot; (Neil Young)\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy The Junkies :)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66d1d56b02c5a3f37452fce7c0d24e3d5c247136","amp;dn":"Cowboy+Junkies+-+Discography+1986+-+2011+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66d1d56b02c5a3f37452fce7c0d24e3d5c247136","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,209,213,107,2,197,163,243,116,82,252,231,192,210,78,61,92,36,113,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
