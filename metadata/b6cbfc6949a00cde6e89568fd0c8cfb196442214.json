Based upon the experiences of &quot;tens of thousands of people&quot; and women's responses to a questionnaire, her latest work aspires to offer &quot;simple, practical ways to communicate and make both (sexes) happier.&quot; Though arguably bordering on stereotype, her easily digestible truths (women put love first, are creators, have a sacred relationships with time) can help both sexes gain perspective. But treacly writing (e.g., &quot;no beauty treatment... outfit... jewels... can make a woman look as radiant as when she is feeling loved&quot;) and heavy-handed admonitions (e.g., to read the book &quot;from start to finish&quot;) detract from more helpful observations. However, restraint is not DeAngelis's trademark, nor what fans expect. Though the focus is on interpreting women's behavior (e.g., viewing being &quot;too emotional&quot; as &quot;in touch with feelings&quot;), men's behavior doesn't seem to merit the same consideration. For example, she lists the top-10 male habits that drive women crazy (vagueness, emotional withdrawal, lying to avoid unpleasantness, bossing women around) without further elucidation. Perhaps DeAngelis is saving the interpretations for the sequel, but it's a shame to turn off men who may benefit from her genuine insights in, for example, the small but provocative section on sex. (Aug.)Forecast: Women will flock to this, as they have to her other bestsellers, but the intended male audience may prove difficult to capture.\n\n\n\n[/code][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6cbfc6949a00cde6e89568fd0c8cfb196442214","amp;dn":"What+Women+Want+Men+to+Know-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6cbfc6949a00cde6e89568fd0c8cfb196442214","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,203,252,105,73,160,12,222,110,137,86,143,208,200,207,177,150,68,34,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
