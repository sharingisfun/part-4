The series takes place primarily during the third/fourth year of Batman's career.

Central to the storyline is a territory war between Two-Face and the remnants of the Falcone mob, led by Sofia Falcone.  The story is also a re-telling of the origins of Batman's sidekick Robin and his adoption by Bruce Wayne.
