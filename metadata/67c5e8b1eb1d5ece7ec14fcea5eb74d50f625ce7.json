Creativity is not just the realm of artists and inventors. Everyone is born with creativity, and everyone can learn to use it to sharpen their problem-solving skills, improve relationships, embrace change and challenge, and build positive attitudes. The book supplies tools, exercises, and techniques proven to boost mental effectiveness and creative thinking skills. Drawing on the fields of psychology, philosophy, and creativity, the book presents a practical action plan for achieving peak creativity-the first step in creating top-performing organizations. STEPHEN D. EIFFERT (Springfield, MO) is a nationally acclaimed speaker and consultant.
