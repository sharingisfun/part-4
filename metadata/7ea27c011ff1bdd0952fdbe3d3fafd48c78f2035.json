Pabby et al. (CRC, 2015).pdf\r\n\r\nThe Handbook of Membrane Separations: Chemical, Pharmaceutical, Food, and Biotechnological Applications, Second Edition provides detailed information on membrane separation technologies from an international team of experts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe handbook fills an important gap in the current literature by providing a comprehensive discussion of membrane applications in the chemical, food, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology industries as well as in the treatment of toxic industrial effluents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis revised second edition has been updated and expanded with discussions of new membrane products and processes and novel applications in engineering, life sciences, and energy conversion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt also includes new chapters in the field of membrane science and technology covering recent advances in RO and UF, ionic liquids, nanotechnology, roles of membrane in power generation, updates on fuel cells, new membrane extraction configuration, and other important topics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe handbook is equally suited for the newcomer to the field as it is for process engineers and research scientists (membranologists/membrane experts) who are interested in obtaining more advanced information about specific applications. It provides readers with a comprehensive and well-balanced overview of the present state of membrane science and technology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ea27c011ff1bdd0952fdbe3d3fafd48c78f2035","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Membrane+Separations+2nd+ed+-+Anil+K.+Pabby+et+al.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ea27c011ff1bdd0952fdbe3d3fafd48c78f2035","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,162,124,1,31,241,189,208,149,47,219,227,211,250,253,72,199,143,32,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
