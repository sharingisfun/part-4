Active Dreaming offers three core areas of practice: talking and walking our dreams to bring energy and guidance from the dreamworld into everyday life; shamanic lucid dreaming; and conscious living.\n\nActive dreamers are choosers. They learn to recognize that whatever situation they are in, they always have choice. They choose not to buy into self-limiting beliefs or the limited models of reality suggested by others. Active dreamers learn to grow a dream of possibility, a dream strong enough to take them beyond fear and despair to a place of freedom and delight.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fff43d184fc31e1a9fbfc0e7b54ce33a58973a4","amp;dn":"Active+Dreaming+-+Robert+Moss.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fff43d184fc31e1a9fbfc0e7b54ce33a58973a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,255,67,209,132,252,49,225,169,251,252,14,123,84,206,51,165,137,115,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
