Thompson, illustrated by Ralph Steadman. The book is a roman Ã  clef, rooted in autobiographical incidents. The story follows its protagonist, Raoul Duke, and his attorney, Dr. Gonzo, as they descend on Las Vegas to chase the American Dream through a drug-induced haze, all the while ruminating on the failure of the 1960s countercultural movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter S.
