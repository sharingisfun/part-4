Although the band are commonly classified as hard rock, and considered pioneers of heavy metal,[1][2] they have always classified their music as &quot;rock and roll&quot;.[3]\n\nAC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, High Voltage, in 1975. Membership remained stable until bassist Mark Evans was replaced by Cliff Williams in 1977. In 1979, the band recorded their highly successful album Highway to Hell. Lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980, after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group briefly considered disbanding, but soon ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was selected as Scott's replacement. Later that year, the band released their best-selling album, Back in Black.\n\nThe band's next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, was also highly successful and was their first album to reach number one in the United States. AC/DC declined in popularity soon after drummer Phil Rudd was fired in 1983 and replaced by future Dio drummer Simon Wright. Phil Rudd returned in 1994 (after Chris Slade was asked to leave in favour of him) and contributed to the band's 1995 album Ballbreaker. Stiff Upper Lip was released in 2000 and was well-received by critics. The band's most recent album Black Ice was released on 20 October 2008.[4]\n\nAC/DC has sold more than 200 million albums worldwide,[5] including 71 million albums in the United States.[6] Back in Black has sold an estimated 45 million units worldwide[7] and 22 million in the United States alone, where it is the fifth highest-selling album.[8] AC/DC ranked fourth on VH1's list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;[9] and the seventh &quot;Greatest Heavy Metal Band of All Time&quot; by MTV.[10] In 2004, the band was ranked number 72 in the Rolling Stone list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh Voltage 1975 International Edition\n\n\nHigh Voltage is the debut studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released in February 1975. Six of the album's eight songs were written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Bon Scott. &quot;Soul Stripper&quot; was written by Young &amp; Young, and &quot;Baby, Please Don't Go&quot; is a cover version of a Big Joe Williams song. It was originally released on Albert Productions. It was never reissued by another label in this format, though a High Voltage album was released internationally on Atlantic Records in 1976.\n\nAC/DC was still developing its sound when High Voltage was recorded in November 1974, and Scott and the Young brothers were backed by a different rhythm section than the Mark Evans/Phil Rudd combination featured on their next three full-length studio recordings.\n\nHigh Voltage led to the first of many AC/DC appearances on Australia's Countdown music program. The band's earliest appearances included a now-legendary live performance of &quot;Baby, Please Don't Go&quot; (featuring Scott dressed as a blonde schoolgirl) and a filmed performance of &quot;Show Business.&quot;\n\nReleased in May 1976, and featuring a different cover, the international version of High Voltage was a compilation of the original Australian edition and its follow-up, the Australia-only T.N.T. album. Despite its title, the second High Voltage features only two tracks from the original: &quot;She's Got Balls&quot; and &quot;Little Lover&quot;.\n\nFour of the other songs on the original, &quot;Baby, Please Don't Go&quot;, &quot;You Ain't Got a Hold on Me&quot;, &quot;Soul Stripper&quot;, and &quot;Show Business&quot;, were included on the '74 Jailbreak EP, released in the United States, Canada, and Japan in October 1984. To date, &quot;Stick Around&quot; and &quot;Love Song&quot; have not been released internationally.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:16\n2.\t&quot;Rock 'n' Roll Singer&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:04\n3.\t&quot;The Jack&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:52\n4.\t&quot;Live Wire&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:50\n5.\t&quot;T.N.T.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34\n6.\t&quot;Can I Sit Next to You Girl&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:12\n7.\t&quot;Little Lover&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:37\n8.\t&quot;She's Got Balls&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:51\n9.\t&quot;High Voltage&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT.N.T. 1975\n\n\nT.N.T. is the second studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released in December 1975. Seven of the album's nine songs were written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Bon Scott. &quot;Can I Sit Next to You Girl&quot; was written by Young &amp; Young, and &quot;School Days&quot; is a cover version of a Chuck Berry song.\n\nIt was originally released on Albert Productions, and was never reissued by another label. However, most of its contents were included on Atlantic Records' High Voltage album, which was released internationally in May 1976.\n\nT.N.T. marked a change in direction from AC/DC's debut album, High Voltage, released in February 1975. Whereas High Voltage featured more of a glam rock-influenced sound, T.N.T. saw the band fully embrace the formula for which they would become famous: hard-edged, rhythm &amp; blues-based rock 'n' roll. This album contains some of the band's best-known songs, including the title track, &quot;It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)&quot;, &quot;The Jack&quot;, and others.\n\nT.N.T. also led to more AC/DC appearances on Australia's Countdown music program, following those in support of High Voltage. These appearances included a live performance of the song &quot;T.N.T.&quot;, as well as a music video for &quot;It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)&quot;.\n\nFilmed on February 23, 1976, the video featured the band's then-current lineup, along with members of the Rats of Tobruk Pipe Band, on the back of a flat-bed truck traveling on Swanston Street in Melbourne, Australia.[1] On October 1, 2004, Melbourne's Corporation Lane was renamed ACDC Lane as a tribute to AC/DC, with the decision being based in part on this video\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:15\n2.\t&quot;Rock 'n' Roll Singer&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:04\n3.\t&quot;The Jack&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:52\n4.\t&quot;Live Wire&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:49\n5.\t&quot;T.N.T.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34\n6.\t&quot;Rocker&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:51\n7.\t&quot;Can I Sit Next to You Girl&quot; (Young, Young) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:12\n8.\t&quot;High Voltage&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22\n9.\t&quot;School Days&quot; (Chuck Berry) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap 1976 International Edition\n\n\nDirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap is the third studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released in September 1976. All songs were written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Bon Scott. It was originally released on Albert Productions. A modified international edition was released on Atlantic Records in 1976.\n\nFollowing up on the preceding Australian album, 1975's T.N.T., AC/DC delivered another crowd-pleasing recording with a number of fan-favourite songs, including the title track, &quot;Squealer&quot;, &quot;Problem Child&quot;, and others. Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap also contains some of the most controversial lyrics found on any AC/DC album.\n\nDirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap also led to more AC/DC appearances on Australia's Countdown music program, following those in support of High Voltage and T.N.T. These appearances included a live performance of the album's title track, as well as a music video for &quot;Jailbreak&quot;.[1]\n\nA song titled &quot;I'm a Rebel&quot; was recorded during this album's sessions in 1976, with music and lyrics written by Angus and Malcolm Young's older brother, Alex Young. This song was never released and remains in Albert Productions' vaults.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:12 (full length version) 3:52 (edited version)\n2.\t&quot;Love at First Feel&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:13\n3.\t&quot;Big Balls&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:39\n4.\t&quot;Rocker&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:52\n5.\t&quot;Problem Child&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:47\n6.\t&quot;There's Gonna Be Some Rockin'&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:18\n7.\t&quot;Ain't No Fun (Waiting Round to Be a Millionaire)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:29 (full length version), 6:58 (edited version)\n8.\t&quot;Ride On&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:54\n9.\t&quot;Squealer&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet There Be Rock 1977 International Edition\n\n\nLet There Be Rock is the fourth studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released in March 1977. All songs were written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Bon Scott. It was originally released on Albert Productions. A modified international edition was released on Atlantic Records in June 1977.\n\nLet There Be Rock was also the last AC/DC recording to feature bassist Mark Evans, who previously played on T.N.T. (1975) and Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (1976).\n\nOn 3 April 1977, AC/DC filmed a live performance of &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot; for Australia's Countdown. In July 1977, the band further promoted Let There Be Rock by filming a music video for the album's title track. Recorded in a church in Perth, it featured Scott as a priest and the rest of the band as altar boys.[1]\n\nThis edition was eventually repackaged with the international version's cover (see image), marking the first time an Australian AC/DC album cover was matched to its corresponding international edition.\n\nIn 1980, AC/DC released a live concert motion picture titled AC/DC: Let There Be Rock. In 1997, an expanded audio recording of this concert was released on CD as Let There Be Rock: The Movie, on discs 2-3 of the Bonfire box set.\n\nAs with AC/DC's previous albums, there were differences between Let There Be Rock's Australian and international edition, released in June 1977. However, the Australian version of Let There Be Rock was originally available in international markets outside the United States and Japan, but only on original vinyl printings. All international CD releases contain the modified track listing.\n\nAtlantic Records removed the racy &quot;Crabsody In Blue&quot; from the true international version. It was replaced with a shortened version of &quot;Problem Child&quot; from the Australian version of the album Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, released in September 1976. &quot;Crabsody In Blue&quot; has not been officially released internationally on CD. The international version's cover also marked the debut of the band's logo.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Go Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:18 (vinyl), 5:31 (CD)\n2.\t&quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34\n3.\t&quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:06\n4.\t&quot;Bad Boy Boogie&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27\n5.\t&quot;Problem Child&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:24\n6.\t&quot;Overdose&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:09\n7.\t&quot;Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:21\n8.\t&quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:24\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowerage 1978 \n\n\nPowerage is the fifth studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released in May 1978. It is also AC/DC's fourth international studio album. All songs were written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Bon Scott.\n\nIt was originally released on Atlantic Records, and reached #133 on Billboard's Pop Albums chart in the US, eventually going platinum there. Powerage was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series.\n\nPowerage is the first AC/DC album to be released nearly simultaneously in both Australian and international markets, and the first to use just one cover image for both. It was also the first to feature the same track listing on all versions, with the exception of the European vinyl edition. This version included &quot;Cold Hearted Man&quot;, a song that has not been officially released on any other AC/DC album, but which became more widely available through the box set of Bon Scott-era vinyl LP albums in 1987, the first reissue of a set first released in 1981. Within the 1987 box set, the song was packaged on a single sided 12&quot; single. In some territories, Powerage omitted &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Damnation&quot;.\n\n&quot;Sin City&quot; was covered by the 80s Heavy metal band Twisted Sister, on their album Twisted Forever, in which Dee Snider changes a lyric: &quot;Ain't got a hope in hell, that's Bon Scott's belief.&quot; The song has also been covered by the punk rock band The Offspring, and Bruce Dickinson.\n\n&quot;Gone Shootin'&quot; was featured in the movie Beavis and Butt-head Do America. In 2007, a studio version of the song, with Brian Johnson on vocals, was included on the second disc of Plug Me In. The footage was taken from a recording session in 1996 at London's VH1 Studios.\n\nPowerage marked the studio debut of bassist Cliff Williams. It was the band's last Bon Scott-era studio release to feature production work by Harry Vanda and George Young.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Rock 'n' Roll Damnation&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37\n2.\t&quot;Down Payment Blues&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:03\n3.\t&quot;Gimme a Bullet&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21\n4.\t&quot;Riff Raff&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:11\n5.\t&quot;Sin City&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:45\n6.\t&quot;What's Next to the Moon&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:31\n7.\t&quot;Gone Shootin'&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:05\n8.\t&quot;Up to My Neck in You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:13\n9.\t&quot;Kicked in the Teeth&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighway to Hell 1979\n\n\nHighway to Hell is the sixth studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released in July 1979. It is also AC/DC's fifth international studio album. It was the last album featuring Bon Scott, who died early the following year from over-consumption of alcohol.\n\nIt was originally released by Albert Productions, who licensed the album to Atlantic Records for release outside of Australia, and was then re-released by Epic Records in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series. On May 25th 2006, Highway to Hell was certified 7x platinum by the RIAA.[1] In 2003, the album was ranked number 199 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nHighway to Hell is the last AC/DC album recorded with lead vocalist Bon Scott before his death in February 1980. The final words spoken by Scott on the album are &quot;Shazbot, na-nu na-nu,&quot; phrases used on the then-popular American sitcom, Mork and Mindy, by lead character Mork (a visiting extraterrestrial played by Robin Williams).\n\nHighway to Hell was the first AC/DC album not produced by Harry Vanda and George Young. Pre-production of the album began in January 1979 with demos cut at Albert Studios in Sydney, Australia, where they met the intended producer, Eddie Kramer. Kramer was fired before a single track had been completed, and Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange was brought in to replace him. The change proved to be fortuitous, with Lange also producing the band's biggest sellers, Back in Black and For Those About to Rock. The album was recorded during sessions in February 1979 at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida and March-April at Roundhouse Studios in London, England.\n\nIn Australia, Highway to Hell was released with a slightly different album cover, featuring flames and a drawing of a bass guitar neck superimposed over the same group photo used on the international cover. Additionally, the East German release had different and much plainer designs on the front and back, apparently because the authorities were not happy with the sleeve as released elsewhere.\n\nIn June 1985, a highly publicized murder case began revolving around Richard RamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­rez, who was responsible for several brutal killings in Los Angeles. Nicknamed the &quot;Night Stalker,&quot; RamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­rez was a fan of AC/DC, particularly the song &quot;Night Prowler.&quot; Police also claimed that Ramirez was wearing an AC/DC shirt and left an AC/DC hat at one of the crime scenes. During the trial, RamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­rez often muttered &quot;Hail Satan&quot; and showed off the pentagram carved into his palm. This brought extremely bad publicity on AC/DC, whose concerts and albums faced protests by parents in the Los Angeles area.[3] On VH1's Behind the Music on AC/DC, the band maintained that the song had been given a murderous connotation by RamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­rez, but is actually about a boy sneaking into his girlfriend's bedroom at night.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Highway to Hell&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:28\n2.\t&quot;Girls Got Rhythm&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23\n3.\t&quot;Walk All Over You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:10\n4.\t&quot;Touch Too Much&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27\n5.\t&quot;Beating Around the Bush&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n6.\t&quot;Shot Down in Flames&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22\n7.\t&quot;Get It Hot&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:34\n8.\t&quot;If You Want Blood (You've Got It)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37\n9.\t&quot;Love Hungry Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n10.\t&quot;Night Prowler&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:27\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in Black 1980\n\n\nBack in Black is the 7th studio album (in Australia, 6th in the rest of the world) by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released on 25 July 1980. Back in Black was the first AC/DC album recorded without former lead singer Bon Scott, who had died at the age of 33 on 19 February 1980. The band considered disbanding following Scott's death, but they ultimately decided to continue and shortly thereafter hired Brian Johnson as their new lead singer and lyricist. Producer Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange, who had previously worked with AC/DC on Highway to Hell, was again brought in to produce.\n\nThe album was remastered and re-released first in late 1994, then again in the Bonfire box set in 1997, and as part of the AC/DC Remasters Series in 2003. In addition, a Dualdisc version was released in 2004, featuring the album in enhanced LPCM Stereo format and the video documentary The Story of Back in Black.\n\nIt sold an estimated 45 million copies to date, making it second only to Michael Jackson's Thriller as the best-selling album of all-time as well as the best selling album ever released by a band.[2] On 13 December 2007, the RIAA certified it 22ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ Multi Platinum, recognising sales of 22 million in the United States\n\nBack in Black contains some of AC/DC's biggest hits, including &quot;Hells Bells&quot;, &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot;, and the title track &quot;Back in Black.&quot; According to Angus Young the album's all-black cover was a &quot;sign of mourning&quot; for Scott, as black is the traditional Western colour of mourning. It is AC/DC's best selling album, the second best-selling album of all time, and the biggest selling album by any band, with more than 45 million copies sold worldwide.[2] In 2006 Back in Black was certified by the Recording Industry Association of America as the fifth best-selling album in the United States, with 22 million copies sold.[4] Despite its massive commercial success, it is not AC/DC's highest charting album in the U.S, peaking at #4; their next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, hit #1 in 1981[5] as did the band's 2008 album Black Ice.\n\nIn 1989, it was ranked #26 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 100 Greatest Albums of the 80's. In 2003, the album was ranked number 73 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.[6] VH1 named 'Back in Black' as one of the biggest comeback albums of all time and also rated it as #2 in VH1 Greatest Hard Rock Songs.\n\nThe song Have a Drink On Me was in the 2006 movie Beerfest.\n\nAmerican Death Metal Band Six Feet Under covered the album in its entirety on their album Graveyard Classics 2.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Hells Bells&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:12\n2.\t&quot;Shoot to Thrill&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:17\n3.\t&quot;What Do You Do for Money Honey&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36\n4.\t&quot;Giving the Dog a Bone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32\n5.\t&quot;Let Me Put My Love into You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15\n6.\t&quot;Back in Black&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16\n7.\t&quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30\n8.\t&quot;Have a Drink on Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58\n9.\t&quot;Shake a Leg&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:06\n10.\t&quot;Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Those About to Rock We Salute You 1981\n\n\nFor Those About to Rock (We Salute You) is the eighth album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released in 1981. The album was a follow-up to their highly successful album Back in Black. For Those About to Rock has sold over 4 million copies in the US. It was AC/DC's first and only No. 1 album in the USA until the release of Black Ice in October 2008. In their original 1981 review, Rolling Stone magazine declared it to be their best album.\n\nThe album was the third and final produced for the band by Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange.\n\nThe name of the album was inspired by a book Angus Young read, entitled For Those About To Die, We Salute You, about Roman gladiators. The gladiators' final words to the emperor were &quot;Ave Caesar morituri te salutant&quot; - or, &quot;Hail Caesar, we who are about to die, salute you.&quot; The album was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series.\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:44\n2.\t&quot;Put the Finger on You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n3.\t&quot;Let's Get It Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n4.\t&quot;Inject the Venom&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30\n5.\t&quot;Snowballed&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23\n6.\t&quot;Evil Walks&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:23\n7.\t&quot;C.O.D.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:19\n8.\t&quot;Breaking the Rules&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:23\n9.\t&quot;Night of the Long Knives&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n10.\t&quot;Spellbound&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlick of the Switch 1983\n\nFlick of the Switch is the ninth album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, recorded shortly after their European Tour at the beginning of 1983. The album was originally released in the United States on 15 August 1983. The album was self-produced by AC/DC and reached #4 in UK and #15 in the US. Though considered a disappointment when released,[citation needed] the album has been certified platinum by the RIAA.\n\nAfter problems with rhythm guitarist Malcolm Young, drummer Phil Rudd was fired midway through the recording sessions, although he had completed his drum parts. Session drummer B.J. Wilson was drafted in to help complete the recording, but his contributions were eventually not used. Rudd was eventually replaced by future Dio drummer Simon Wright. Wright appeared in the videos for &quot;Flick of the Switch&quot; and &quot;Nervous Shakedown&quot;[2]. He was also on the tour for the album, and noted in the pro-shot video recordings of that tour. Rudd returned to the band in 1994. The album was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Rising Power&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n2.\t&quot;This House Is on Fire&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n3.\t&quot;Flick of the Switch&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:15\n4.\t&quot;Nervous Shakedown&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:29\n5.\t&quot;Landslide&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59\n6.\t&quot;Guns for Hire&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26\n7.\t&quot;Deep in the Hole&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21\n8.\t&quot;Bedlam in Belgium&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n9.\t&quot;Badlands&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40\n10.\t&quot;Brain Shake&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09\n\n\n\n74 Jailbreak  1984 EP\n\n\n74 Jailbreak is an EP by Australian band AC/DC, comprising five hard rock/blues oriented tracks that had previously been released only in Australia. It was released in 1984 in the United States, Canada and Japan. The song &quot;Jailbreak&quot; was also released as a single and a video. The EP was reissued in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series.\n\nThe first track is from the Australian version of Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (1976), while the rest are from the Australian version of the band's debut album, the Australian version of High Voltage, recorded in 1974 and released early the following year. \n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Jailbreak&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:40\n2.\t&quot;You Ain't Got a Hold on Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30\n3.\t&quot;Show Business&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:43\n4.\t&quot;Soul Stripper&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:23 (Angus Young, Malcolm Young)\n5.\t&quot;Baby, Please Don't Go&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:50 (Big Joe Williams)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFly on the Wall 1985\n\n\nFly on the Wall is the tenth studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, originally released on 28 June 1985. The band's second and last self-produced album, it was also the first AC/DC album not to include drummer Phil Rudd, who was replaced by Simon Wright. Like their previous album, Flick of the Switch, Angus and Malcolm Young chose to produce in order to capture the rawness and simplicity of their early works[2] in a time when pop-oriented glam metal became popular.\n\nThe album was not well received by critics and only sold one million copies upon its release, as opposed to the success of their previous albums, Back in Black and For Those About to Rock We Salute You.[3] The singles &quot;Shake Your Foundations&quot; and &quot;Sink the Pink&quot;, however, are chosen as standouts from the album,[1][4][5] and both songs were included in the band's soundtrack to Stephen King's film Maximum Overdrive titled Who Made Who. A video featuring the band performing five of the album's songs was also released in the summer of 1985. The album was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Fly on the Wall&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43\n2.\t&quot;Shake Your Foundations&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:10\n3.\t&quot;First Blood&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40\n4.\t&quot;Danger&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22\n5.\t&quot;Sink the Pink&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n6.\t&quot;Playing With Girls&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44\n7.\t&quot;Stand Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53\n8.\t&quot;Hell or High Water&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:31\n9.\t&quot;Back in Business&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22\n10.\t&quot;Send for the Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho Made Who 1986\n\n\nWho Made Who is a hard rock album by Australian band AC/DC, released in 1986 as the soundtrack to the Stephen King movie Maximum Overdrive. King would allude to the album's title song in the 1990 revised and expanded edition of his novel The Stand, where a survivor of the novel's flu pandemic changes the lyrics to &quot;Who Made Flu.&quot; Three tracks on the album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Who Made Who&quot; and the instrumentals &quot;D.T.&quot; and &quot;Chase the Ace&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ were newly written and recorded by AC/DC. The rest were taken from the band's previous albums. Only one song, &quot;Ride On,&quot; is from the Bon Scott era; the others all feature Brian Johnson. The album has sold 5 million copies in the USA. The album reached #11 in the UK and #33 in the US.\n\nAlong with the album, the band released a video tape which contained music videos for the songs &quot;Who Made Who&quot;, &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot;, &quot;Shake Your Foundations&quot;, &quot;Hells Bells&quot;, and footage from a live performance of &quot;For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)&quot; which was filmed in Detroit in 1983. The album was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Who Made Who&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26\n2.\t&quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30\n3.\t&quot;D.T.&quot; (A.

It was later released in the U.S. on February 1st 1988. The album was recorded at the Miraval Studio in Le Val, France in between August and September 1987.\n\nThe album was produced by Harry Vanda and George Young, the production team behind the band's early albums. This was also the final studio album to feature drummer Simon Wright. Although he wrote all the lyrics on the album, it would be the last on which Brian Johnson was credited as a songwriter (all the songs on subsequent albums were written by the Young brothers). The title of the album was taken from a line in the song &quot;That's The Way I Wanna Rock 'n' Roll&quot;.\n\nThe album was the band's biggest-selling album of new material since For Those About To Rock, We Salute You, being certified Platinum in the US. Blow Up Your Video reached #2 in the UK and #12 in the US. However, the band played four tracks from it on the subsequent world tour, &quot;Heatseeker&quot;, &quot;That's the Way I Wanna Rock 'n' Roll&quot;, &quot;Nick of Time&quot;, and &quot;Go Zone&quot; - &quot;Heatseeker&quot; and &quot;That's The Way I Wanna Rock 'n' Roll&quot; are also featured on AC/DC Live Collector's Edition. &quot;Heatseeker&quot; was a top 20 hit in the United Kingdom. The album was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series. During the Blow Up Your Video world tour, Malcolm Young decided not to participate in touring because he wanted to get over an alcohol addiction. Filling in for him was Malcolm and Angus' nephew, Stevie Young, although Malcolm is present in the Blow Up Your Video promotional videos.\n\nSeveral outtakes from the recording sessions include several songs not on the album called, &quot;Let It Loose&quot;, and &quot;Alright Tonight&quot;, as well as other versions of &quot;Heatseeker&quot;, and &quot;That's the Way I Wanna Rock 'n' Roll&quot;.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Heatseeker&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50\n2.\t&quot;That's the Way I Wanna Rock 'n' Roll&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43\n3.\t&quot;Meanstreak&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n4.\t&quot;Go Zone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:26\n5.\t&quot;Kissin' Dynamite&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58\n6.\t&quot;Nick of Time&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16\n7.\t&quot;Some Sin for Nuthin'&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:11\n8.\t&quot;Ruff Stuff&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34\n9.\t&quot;Two's Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:19\n10.\t&quot;This Means War&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Razors Edge 1990\n\n\nThe Razors Edge is an album by AC/DC, released on September 21, 1990. The album was the only studio album to feature drummer Chris Slade, and includes such songs as &quot;Thunderstruck&quot; and &quot;Moneytalks,&quot; which are among AC/DC's most well-known songs. The album reached #2 on The Billboard 200 and #4 on the UK, a smash commercial success that returned the band to the popularity of its glory years of the early 1980s. The album has been certified quintuple platinum (5 million copies sold)[1] in the U.S., and the album was re-released in 2003 as part of AC/DC's Remasters series.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Thunderstruck&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:53\n2.\t&quot;Fire Your Guns&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:54\n3.\t&quot;Moneytalks&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:46\n4.\t&quot;The Razors Edge&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:23\n5.\t&quot;Mistress for Christmas&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:00\n6.\t&quot;Rock Your Heart Out&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:07\n7.\t&quot;Are You Ready&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:10\n8.\t&quot;Got You by the Balls&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30\n9.\t&quot;Shot of Love&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:57\n10.\t&quot;Lets Make It&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32\n11.\t&quot;Goodbye &amp; Good Riddance to Bad Luck&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:14\n12.\t&quot;If You Dare&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBallbreaker 1995\n\n\nBallbreaker is the 13th studio album by the Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released in 1995. It was the band's first studio album in five years, since The Razors Edge (1990). The album also featured the return of former drummer, Phil Rudd, who had been fired from the band in 1983 as a result of problems with rhythm guitarist Malcolm Young. The three singles released from this album were &quot;Hard as a Rock,&quot; &quot;Cover You in Oil,&quot; and &quot;Hail Caesar.&quot; The album was produced by long time Slayer producer, Rick Rubin. Rubin had previously worked with the band to produce the song/single &quot;Big Gun,&quot; which was released two years before on the soundtrack to the movie Last Action Hero.\n\nTwo weeks into the U.S. tour, four gigs were cancelled so that Brian Johnson could attend his father's funeral. During the tour, MTV cartoon characters Beavis and Butthead also appeared in the intro during concerts as well. Five of the songs were played live, 'Hard As a Rock', 'Boogie Man', 'Cover You In Oil', 'Hail Caesar', and 'Ballbreaker'.\n\nThe album was re-released in 2005 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series. The album is currently certified Double Platinum by the RIAA in the US, for sales in excess of 2,000,000.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Hard as a Rock&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:31\n2.\t&quot;Cover You in Oil&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:32\n3.\t&quot;The Furor&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:10\n4.\t&quot;Boogie Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:07\n5.\t&quot;The Honey Roll&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:34\n6.\t&quot;Burnin' Alive&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:05\n7.\t&quot;Hail Caesar&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:14\n8.\t&quot;Love Bomb&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:14\n9.\t&quot;Caught With Your Pants Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n10.\t&quot;Whiskey on the Rocks&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35\n11.\t&quot;Ballbreaker&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:31\n\n\n\n\n\nStiff Upper Lip 2000\n\nStiff Upper Lip is the 14th album by Australian band AC/DC; it was released in 2000.

AC/DC were known to be working on the album as early as January 2006, with it being delayed because of an injury to bassist Cliff Williams and a change of record labels to Sony Music, and in turn Columbia Records. It is their first album since the release of Stiff Upper Lip in 2000, the longest gap between two AC/DC studio albums to date.\n\nThe album is their longest to date. The band recorded it in The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, Canada, the same studio as their previous album Stiff Upper Lip.\n\nBlack Ice sold around 1,762,000 units in its first week, shipping 5,000,000 copies worldwide. The album went to number one in 29 different countries, including Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In its first week, it sold 784,000 copies in the US alone, with it receiving a three times platinum certification in Australia and selling upwards of 110,000 in the UK. As of May 2009 the album has sold 8 million copies worldwide[1] and it is the second-best selling album of 2008 [2]. Rolling Stone magazine also ranked Black Ice number 41 on their list &quot;Top 50 Best Albums of 2008&quot;.[3] Black Ice was also named the 3rd best album of 2008 by Metal Hammer.\n\nTracks:\n\n1.\t&quot;Rock 'n' Roll Train&quot; \n2.\t &quot;Skies on Fire&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Big Jack&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Anything Goes&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;War Machine&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Smash 'n' Grab&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Spoilin' for a Fight&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Wheels&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Decibel&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Stormy May Day&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;She Likes Rock 'n' Roll&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Money Made&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;Rock 'n' Roll Dream&quot;  \n14.\t&quot;Rocking All the Way&quot;  \n15.\t&quot;Black Ice&quot;  \n\n\n\n\nLIVE ALBUMS \n\n\n\nIf You Want Blood You Got It 1978\n\n\nIf You Want Blood You've Got It is the first live album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, originally released in the U.S.A. on 21 November 1978.
