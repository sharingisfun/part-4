She isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a chef or a restaurant ownerÃ¢â‚¬â€sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never even waitressed. Cooking in her tiny Manhattan kitchen was, at least at first, for special occasionsÃ¢â‚¬â€and, too often, an unnecessarily daunting venture. Deb found herself overwhelmed by the number of recipes available to her. Have you ever searched for the perfect birthday cake on Google? YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get more than three million results. Where do you start? What if you pick a recipe thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s downright bad?\n\nSo Deb founded her award-winning blog, Smitten Kitchen, on the premise that cooking should be a pleasure, and that the results of your labor canÃ¢â‚¬â€and shouldÃ¢â‚¬â€be delicious . . . every time. Deb is a firm believer that there are no bad cooks, just bad recipes. She has dedicated herself to creating and finding the best of the best and adapting the recipes for the everyday cook.\nAnd now, with the same warmth, candor, and can-do spirit her blog is known for, Deb presents her first cookbook: more than 100 recipesÃ¢â‚¬â€almost entirely new, plus a few favorites from the siteÃ¢â‚¬â€all gorgeously illustrated with hundreds of her beautiful color photographs.\n\nThe Smitten Kitchen Cookbook is all about approachable, uncompromised home cooking. Here youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find better uses for your favorite vegetables: asparagus blanketing a pizza; ratatouille dressing up a sandwich; cauliflower masquerading as pesto. These are recipes youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll bookmark and use so often they become your own, recipes youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll slip to a friend who wants to impress her new in-laws, and recipes with simple ingredients that yield amazing results in a minimum amount of time. Deb tells you her favorite summer cocktail; how to lose your fear of cooking for a crowd; and the essential items you need for your own kitchen. From salads and slaws that make perfect side dishes (or a full meal) to savory tarts and galettes; from Mushroom Bourguignon to Chocolate Hazelnut Crepe Cake, Deb knows just the thing for a Tuesday night, or your most special occasion. \n\n \n                Support the Editors &amp; Buy the Book If you Like it \n\n\nScreen:\n\n              &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/haMEOaaEo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/haMEOaaEo&lt;/a&gt;\n \n\n            --As Eternity has reckoned There's a lifetime in a second--\n\n\nNOTE:\n*Seed as long you can(1:1 ratio is appreciated)\n*If you don't like what you see then don't download.Simple\n*Don't hit and run.Most of these torrents will not be greater than 100MB in size\n*Quality will be top notch regardless of file size be it Videos or Pictures\n*Any torrent which needs seeding kindly comment in that section\n*Visit my uploads @     &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/Orion_Me/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/Orion_Me/&lt;/a&gt;      &amp; \n*Comments are always welcome\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nVisit my Thread of Daily Update Uploads:\n\n              &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=148365&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=148365&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a13487c5a1705b14441230f4726caf2adca81d0","amp;dn":"The+Smitten+Kitchen+Cookbook%28Among+Top+100++CookBook+of+Last+25+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a13487c5a1705b14441230f4726caf2adca81d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,19,72,124,90,23,5,177,68,65,35,15,71,38,202,242,173,202,129,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
