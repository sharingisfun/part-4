It was well written with plenty of illustrations and give the reader a good background on the topic. It deals with the legend of Atlantis the Pyramids, Stonehenge, Nazca Planes, and the believe in a hollow earth. It is a good overview of the topic and mentions several other authors and books that one could look into to investigate further. I also does not simply promote the beliefs uncritically but rather gives a balanced view talking about those that do not agree with the ideas also. Definitely worth the read and if this volume is any indication, I cannot wait to read the rest of the series","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b84dacb4d9fd4942e2d425c3f44f13ae322a8e9","amp;dn":"Mystic+places+%28Time-Life+Mysteries+of+the+Unknown%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b84dacb4d9fd4942e2d425c3f44f13ae322a8e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,132,218,203,77,159,212,148,46,45,66,92,63,68,241,58,227,34,168,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
