In this course Chris Griffith offers a thorough overview of building, emulating, and deploying Android and iOS apps with this powerful tool. He'll show you how to configure your development environment, and create brand-new projects with the PhoneGap CLI as well as the Apache Cordova CLI (the framework PhoneGap is built on). Then he'll demonstrate how to test your app, customize and extend the platform to suit your workflow, and compile your app with either PhoneGap Developer or PhoneGap Build. Start watching and learn how to kick-start your apps from the command line now, with the PhoneGap CLI.\nTopics include:\n\nInstalling the PhoneGap and Cordova CLIs\nCreating a new project\nBuilding an app\nTesting apps\nAdding and removing plugins\nUsing hooks\nCompiling apps remotely","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:475b83b5f66150d83d0f6cde7f5e4a6ca28407c9","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Building+Mobile+Apps+with+the+PhoneGap+Command-Line+Inte","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"475b83b5f66150d83d0f6cde7f5e4a6ca28407c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,91,131,181,246,97,80,216,61,15,108,222,127,94,74,108,162,132,7,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
