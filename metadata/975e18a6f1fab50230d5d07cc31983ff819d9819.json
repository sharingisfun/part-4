Same city. Different worlds.\n\nGrammy-award winning star Michael W. Smith delivers a breakthrough performance as a polished, out-of-touch pastor whose professed beliefs are tested when he teams up with a street-smart minister (jeff obafemi carr) to confront tragic circumstances in the inner city.\n\n&quot;It's message is simple: being a Christian requires more than just dropping a check in the collection plate every Sunday morning.&quot; - The New York Times\n\n&quot;Be prepared to have your heart touched and your life changed.&quot; - Janet Parshall, host of Janet Parshall's America!\n\n&quot;The Second Chance reminds the church to stay on track with the business of God. A timely warning to us all.&quot; - Max Lucado\n\n&quot;To say that I enjoyed the film is a vast understatement. I resonated with what I saw in this great piece of work. Anyone who has ever had a ministry in an inner city over an extended period of time, has encountered just about every one of the situations that came out in the film.&quot; - Tony Campolo\n\n\nVideo: 576 x 304, XViD codec, 116kbps, 23 frames/sec\nAudio: LAME MP3, 115kbps\nDuration: 01:42:12\nSubtitle: Romainian\n\nimage icon: http://i119.photobucket.com/albums/o121/tvladb/SecondChance.jpg\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.christiancinema.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=1480&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.christiancinema.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=1480&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlz SEED SEED as long as possible.....\n\nUploaded By Abraham","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:975e18a6f1fab50230d5d07cc31983ff819d9819","amp;dn":"The+Second+Chance%282006%29%28Christian+Movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"975e18a6f1fab50230d5d07cc31983ff819d9819","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,94,24,166,241,250,181,2,48,213,208,124,195,25,131,255,129,157,152,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
