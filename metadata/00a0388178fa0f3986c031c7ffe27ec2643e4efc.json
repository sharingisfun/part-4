Infused with a love of learning, compelling in its arguments for a unifying written culture, it argues brilliantly against the politicization of literature and presents a guide to the great works of the western literary tradition and essential writers of the ages. The Western Canon was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00a0388178fa0f3986c031c7ffe27ec2643e4efc","amp;dn":"Harold+Bloom+-+The+Western+Canon+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00a0388178fa0f3986c031c7ffe27ec2643e4efc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,160,56,129,120,250,15,57,134,192,49,199,255,226,126,194,100,62,78,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
