Whether you want to develop traditional user interfaces or integrate 3D graphics, audio/video, animation, dynamic skinning, touch, rich document support, speech recognition, or more, WPF enables you to do so in a seamless, resolution-independent manner that scales from small tablets to large TVs. WPF 4.5 Unleashed is the authoritative book that covers it all, in a practical and approachable fashion, authored by WPF guru and Microsoft architect Adam Nathan.\n\nCovers everything you need to know about Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML)\nExamines the WPF feature areas in incredible depth: controls, layout, resources, data binding, styling, graphics, animation, and more\nDelves into topics that arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t covered by most books: 3D, speech, audio/video, documents, effects\nShows how to create popular UI elements and leverage built-in controls such as the new Office-style Ribbon\nDemonstrates how to create sophisticated UI mechanisms, such as Visual Studio-like collapsible/dockable panes\nExplains how to create first-class custom controls for WPF\nDemonstrates how to create hybrid WPF software that leverages Windows Forms, DirectX, ActiveX, or other non-WPF technologies\nExplains how to exploit desktop features, such as Jump Lists and taskbar customizations, and the same toast notifications used by Windows Store apps\n\n\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c075a2aa5d2e32d314b7271b46dba4fbe9504d2","amp;dn":"WPF+4.5+Unleashed+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c075a2aa5d2e32d314b7271b46dba4fbe9504d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,7,90,42,165,210,227,45,49,75,114,113,180,109,186,79,190,149,4,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
