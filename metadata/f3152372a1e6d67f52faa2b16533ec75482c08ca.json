There is no other book that embraces all of the events (political, socially, biologically, nutritionally, chemically and genetically) that have been spawned since the publication of The Origin of Species by Darwin more than 100 years ago.             EPIGENETICS is required reading for the very survival of Americans and yes all of humanity - modern man has bet on the wrong horse to save them from disease and pestilence - the medical system has failed us fearfully. It is predictable that this book will impact the world of the everyday man, science, politics, social engineering and medicine to the same degree that Darwin's The Origin of Species did more than 100 years ago.                 This book will be welcomed and enjoyed by religious leaders, community leaders, educators, parents and students of biology, nutrients and genetics in all forms.\n\nAbout the Author:\nDr Wallach was born and raised in Missouri , attended the University of Missouri, where he received a Bachelor's degree in Science of Agriculture.
