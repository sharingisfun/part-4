Through the exploits and experiences of a teenager it explores the violent nature of humans, human free will to choose between good or evil, and the desolation of free will as a solution to evil. Set in a not-so-distant future society with a culture of extreme youth rebellion and violence it satirizes trends in youth culture that were prevalent in the 1960s in the West (and are still contemporary). Burgess experiments with language by writing in a Russian-influenced argot called &quot;Nadsat&quot; which is used by the novelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s teenage anti-hero in his first-person narration and the younger characters. According to Burgess, the novel was a jeu d'esprit written in just three weeks. He bemoaned the fact that the book had been taken as the source material for a 1971 film that was perceived to glorify sex and violence.In 2005, A Clockwork Orange was included on Time magazine's list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923, and it was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. The original manuscript of the book is located at McMaster University. Hamilton, Ontario, Canada since that institution purchased the documents in 1971.\n\nIf you enjoyed this torrent, please return the favor and seed for as long as you can!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24b7d6083e8cf6d76c375797bbabceb8890d727d","amp;dn":"Anthony+Burgess+-+A+Clockwork+Orange+%5B1962%5D+%5BEPUB-MOBI-PDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24b7d6083e8cf6d76c375797bbabceb8890d727d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,183,214,8,62,140,246,215,108,55,87,151,187,171,206,184,137,13,114,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
