As yet, nobody has collected them all in one place with decent show notes, so I have done that. The clips vary in resolution and bit rate, but all of them appear to be DVD rips. I have not ripped these clips myself, thanks to the OPs who first loaded these.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carr&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carr&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.jimmycarr.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.jimmycarr.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JABBkaadc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JABBkaadc&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1585985/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1585985/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nJames Anthony Patrick &quot;Jimmy&quot; Carr (born 15 September 1972) is a British/Irish comedian and Humorist, known for his deadpan delivery and dark humor. He is also a writer, actor and presenter of radio and television.\n\nStand-up comedy\n\nCarr does stand-up tours continuously over the course of the year, taking only five weeks off between them. In 2003 he sold out an entire month's performances of his Edinburgh Festival show Charm Offensive by the second day of the festival, and received 5-star reviews from four major newspapers. In 2004 he performed sold out solo shows at Dublin's Vicar Street, Leicester's Comedy Festival, Glasgow Festival, Kilkenny Cat Laughs and the Galway Festival along with appearances at The Bloomsbury Theatre where he filmed his first live DVD. Also in 2004 he threatened to sue fellow comedian Jim Davidson for using a joke that Carr considered 'his'. The matter was dropped when it became apparent that the joke in question was an old one used for decades by many different comedians. He toured the country with his show, A Public Display of Affection, starting on 9 April 2005 at the Gulbenkian Theatre in Canterbury. He also appeared at the EICC during the Edinburgh Festival in August 2005 with his Off The Telly show. Later on in the year, in late November, he released his second DVD &quot;Jimmy Carr: Stand Up&quot;.\n\nIn August 2006, he commenced a new tour, Gag Reflex, for which he won the 2006 British Comedy Award for &quot;Best Live Stand up&quot;. He released his third DVD, Jimmy Carr: Comedian in November 2007. He also performed at the 2006 Just for Laughs festival in Montreal, as well as making a return visit to the Newbury Comedy Festival. In 2003, he was listed in The Observer as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy. In 2007, a poll on the Channel 4 website for 100 Greatest Stand Ups Jimmy Carr was the 12th. A new national tour commenced in autumn 2007 named Repeat Offender, which began at the Edinburgh Festival that year. In Autumn 2008, Carr began touring his new show, entitled Joke Technician. As with his previous tour, he performed many shows at the Edinburgh Festival, even adding an extra date due to ticket demand.\n\nOn 23 April 2009, the dates for Carr's 2009/10 tour, entitled Rapier Wit, were announced. \n\nThe tour opened on 20 August 2009 with 9 shows at the Edinburgh Festival before touring the country.\n\nOn Twitter, Carr released details about his new DVD entitled Jimmy Carr: Telling Jokes. The DVD was released on the 2 November 2009.\n\nIn July 2009, Carr revealed that he is currently touring with Las Vegas band The Killers. Killers frontman Brandon Flowers explained that it was part of his vision for his bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s shows to become more of a Las Vegas-style spectacle. Flowers, who grew up in Vegas, said: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe had met Jimmy before, at a Comic Relief gig, then we bumped into him again at a party a couple of weeks later. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe were just throwing ideas around and having a comedian as part of the show sounded like a Las Vegas thing to do ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it used to be common in the Sixties and Seventies ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJimmy seemed to like it so we are giving it a go.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nDVD releases\nTitle\t\t\tReleased\t\n\nLive\t\t\t8 November 2004\t\t\t\nStand Up                7 November 2005\tLive at London's Bloomsbury Theatre\t\nComedian                5 November 2007\tLive at London's Bloomsbury Theatre\nIn Concert\t\t3 November 2008\tLive at London's Bloomsbury Theatre \nTelling Jokes\t\t2 November 2009\tLive at London's Bloomsbury Theatre\nMaking People Laugh\t8 November 2010\tLive at Glasgow's Clyde Auditorium\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ca27decb8a109fef3871b6f9b226456291db0e6","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Carr+2004-2010+Comedy+Concert+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ca27decb8a109fef3871b6f9b226456291db0e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,162,125,236,184,161,9,254,243,135,27,111,155,34,100,86,41,29,176,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
