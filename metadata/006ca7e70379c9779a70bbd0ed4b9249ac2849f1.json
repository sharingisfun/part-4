Kelly Cherelle Price was born in Queens, New York. She began singing in church as a toddler. Her first professional engagement was with George Michael at Madison Square Garden in January 1992. As destiny would have it Price was over heard singing by Mariah Carey who after arriving to her own rehearsal late for the Grammys walked into a room where Price was singing in the rehearsal hall while everyone else was on a meal break. Carey subsequently introduced Price to Sony Columbia's then CEO Tommy Mottola. She made a name for herself as a backing and guest vocalist, appearing on a number of hit singles such as Mariah Carey's &quot;Fantasy&quot;, The Notorious B.I.G.'s &quot;Mo Money Mo Problems&quot;, and Whitney Houston's &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;. She has also sung background vocals for Faith Evans, Aretha Franklin, Brian McKnight, SWV and R.
