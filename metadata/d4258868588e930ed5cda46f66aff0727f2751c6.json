During a time when hipsters were obsessed with swing music in its relation to Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin's Rat Pack, the Zippers were fascinated with big-band swing and Harlem, creating a tongue-in-cheek salute to '20s and '30s jazz. For younger listeners familiar with the style but not the content of classic hot jazz, the band was good fun, but purists found the group's vaguely campy sense of humor and amateurish technique off-putting. This debate would never have even been a matter of consideration if &quot;Hell,&quot; an incessantly catchy single from their 1997 album Hot, hadn't been able to sneak through loosened alternative airplay to become a novelty hit. &quot;Hell&quot; became a crossover hit on the strength of a bizarrely theatrical vehicle, and Squirrel Nut Zippers quickly became one of the hottest alternative bands of the first half of the year.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tSwing\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Good Enough For Granddad\n02.Anything But Love\n03.Lover's Lane\n04.Memphis Exorcism\n05.Prince Nez\n06.Put A Lid On It\n07.Hell\n08.Flight Of The Passing Fancy\n09.Low Down Man\n10.Ghost Of Stephen Foster\n11.Under The Sea\n12.Suits Are Picking Up The Bill\n13.Dancing On The Moon\n14.Pallin' With Al\n15.The Kraken\n16.Bedbugs\n17.Baby Wants A Diamond Ring\n18.Hush\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4258868588e930ed5cda46f66aff0727f2751c6","amp;dn":"Squirrel+Nut+Zippers+-+Best+Of++%282002%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4258868588e930ed5cda46f66aff0727f2751c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,37,136,104,88,142,147,14,213,205,164,111,102,175,240,114,127,39,81,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
