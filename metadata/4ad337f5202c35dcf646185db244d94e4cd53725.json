To experience it, viewers need to get a copy of the first Harry Potter movie (known as Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in Europe) and watch it with the sound off, replacing Neely's narration with the original soundtrack.\n\nAfter spreading rapidly among Neely's friends in Austin, Wizard People made its theatrical debut at the New York Underground Film Festival, to rapturous applause. We think Neely has crafted an as-of-yet-unnamed new art form, one everyone should experience for themselves. (Wizard People has no affiliation with Warner Brothers or the creators of Harry Potter.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ad337f5202c35dcf646185db244d94e4cd53725","amp;dn":"Wizard+People%2C+Dear+Reader","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ad337f5202c35dcf646185db244d94e4cd53725","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,211,55,245,32,44,53,220,246,70,24,93,178,68,217,78,76,213,55,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
