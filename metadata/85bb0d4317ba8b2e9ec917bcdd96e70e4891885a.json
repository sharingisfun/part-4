About 300,000 people came, and the organizers put Hells Angels in charge of security around the stage. Armed with pool cues and knifes,The Hells Angels spent the concert beating up spectators, killing at least one. The film intercuts performances, violence, Grace Slick and Mick Jaggers attempts to cool things down, close-ups of young listeners (dancing, drugged, or suffering Angel shock), and a look at the Stones later as they watch concert footage and reflect on what happened.\nThis musical documentary concerns the Rolling Stones and their tragic free concert at Altamont Speedway near San Francisco in early December 1969. The event was all but destroyed by violence that marked the end of the peace and love euphoria of the 1960s. The night began smoothly, with the supercharged Flying Burrito Brothers opening up for the Rolling Stones and performing the truck-driving classic &quot;Six Days on the Road&quot; and Tina Turner giving a sensually charged performance. But on this particular evening, the Stones made the fateful (and disastrous) decision to hire the Oakland chapter of the Hell's Angels motorcycle gang as bodyguards and bouncers. It was a foolhardy, careless choice that turned the night into an unmitigated disaster; halfway through the Stones' act, the Angels killed one black spectator, and injured several others who were present (including Jefferson Airplane's lead singer Marty Balin). In the film, we watch Mick Jagger an ebullient, charismatic performer of bisexual charm reduced to standing on stage like a frightened child with his finger in his mouth in wake of the violence. Unsurprisingly, the Grateful Dead refused to perform after the violence erupted\n\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://www.pix2links.com/images/45363888500600182941.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://www.pix2links.com/images/45363888500600182941.png&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://www.pix2links.com/images/49981595914230743718.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://www.pix2links.com/images/49981595914230743718.png&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://www.pix2links.com/images/80461814689093063866.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://www.pix2links.com/images/80461814689093063866.png&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://www.pix2links.com/images/79731069219098581102.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://www.pix2links.com/images/79731069219098581102.png&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://www.pix2links.com/images/26547675758865214494.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://www.pix2links.com/images/26547675758865214494.png&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://www.pix2links.com/images/08158333528705044214.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://www.pix2links.com/images/08158333528705044214.png&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://www.pix2links.com/images/57103641149710848216.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://www.pix2links.com/images/57103641149710848216.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                   : Base Media\nFile size                        : 699 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 31mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 065 Kbps\nSample                           : Yes\nSource;Gimme.Shelter.1970.720p.BluRay.x264-CLASSiC;thanks\n\nVideo\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nCodec ID/Info                    : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                         : 1h 31mn\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 934 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 3 431 Kbps\nWidth                            : 960 pixels\nHeight                           : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4:3\nFrame rate mode                  : Constant\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\n\n\nAudio\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nDuration                         : 1h 31mn\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 127 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 154 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85bb0d4317ba8b2e9ec917bcdd96e70e4891885a","amp;dn":"Rolling+Stones+Gimme+Shelter+%5B1970%5D+BRRip+x264+%5BZeberzee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85bb0d4317ba8b2e9ec917bcdd96e70e4891885a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,187,13,67,23,186,139,46,158,201,23,188,221,150,231,14,72,145,136,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
