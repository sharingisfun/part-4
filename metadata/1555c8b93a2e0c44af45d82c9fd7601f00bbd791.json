Their 2008 YouTube video cover of the song &quot;Tiger Mountain Peasant Song&quot; by Fleet Foxes spread their name rapidly on the Internet.[1] After that they have achieved world wide fame with their harmonious singing and country-influenced songs.\n\n\nReview:\nSeven years ago, when Swedish sister duo Johanna and Klara SÃƒÂ¶derberg appeared on YouTube singing a Fleet Foxes song in a forest, they seemed like an adorable one-view wonder. Instead, they've blossomed into an excellent indie-country act, like the Carter Family if they'd grown up on Lee Hazlewood's Cowboy in Sweden and Emmylou Harris. Like 2012's The Lion's Roar, Stay Gold was recorded in Omaha with Bright Eyes producer Mike Mogis, whose Big Sky echo and orchestrations complement sublime drifter poetry like &quot;Waitress Song,&quot; where the harmonies tickle God and the lyrics begin, &quot;I could move to a small town and become a waitress/Say my name was Stacey and I was figuring things out.&quot;\nReview By JON DOLAN\nRate 4.5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n01.
