Henry, was an American writer. O. Henry's short stories are known for their wit, wordplay, warm characterization and clever twist endings.\n\nPen Name:\n__\n\nPorter gave various explanations for the origin of his pen name. In 1909 he gave an interview to The New York Times, in which he gave an account of it:\n\nIt was during these New Orleans days that I adopted my pen name of O. Henry. I said to a friend: &quot;I'm going to send out some stuff. I don't know if it amounts to much, so I want to get a literary alias. Help me pick out a good one.&quot; He suggested that we get a newspaper and pick a name from the first list of notables that we found in it. In the society columns we found the account of a fashionable ball. &quot;Here we have our notables,&quot; said he. \n\nWe looked down the list and my eye lighted on the name Henry, &quot;That'll do for a last name,&quot; said I. &quot;Now for a first name. I want something short. None of your three-syllable names for me.&quot; &quot;Why donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you use a plain initial letter, then?&quot; asked my friend. \n\n&quot;Good,&quot; said I, &quot;O is about the easiest letter written, and O it is.&quot;\n\nA newspaper once wrote and asked me what the O stands for. I replied, &quot;O stands for Olivier, the French for Oliver.&quot; And several of my stories accordingly appeared in that paper under the name Olivier Henry.\n\nIn the introduction to The World of O. Henry: Roads of Destiny and Other Stories (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1973), William Trevor writes that when Porter was in the Ohio State Penitentiary &quot;there was a prison guard named Orrin Henry, whom William Sydney Porter . . . immortalised as O. Henry&quot;.\n\nThe writer and scholar Guy Davenport offers another explanation: &quot;The pseudonym that he began to write under in prison is constructed from the first two letters of Ohio and the second and last two of plenipotentiary.&quot;\n\nContent:\n__\n\n# A Retrieved Reformation\n# A Service of Love\n# BABES IN THE JUNGLE\n# Little Speck in Garnered Fruit\n# Squaring The Circle\n# The Gift Of The Magi\n# The Last Leaf\n# THE OCTOPUS MAROONED\n# The Ransom Of Red Chief\n# The Roads We Take\n\n\nAnd, Bonus:\n__\n\n# The Caballero's Way\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
