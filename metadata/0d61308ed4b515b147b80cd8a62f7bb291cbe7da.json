VMware introduced the software to help customers store more and more virtual machines.\n\nAs data centers continue to evolve and grow, managing infrastructure becomes more challenging. Traditional storage solutions like monolithic storage arrays and complex management are often ill-suited to the needs of the modern data center. Software-defined storage solutions, like VMware Virtual SAN, integrate the storage side of the infrastructure with the server side, and can simplify management and improve flexibility.\n\nThis book is a detailed guide which provides you with the knowledge you need to successfully implement and manage VMware VSAN and deployed infrastructures","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d61308ed4b515b147b80cd8a62f7bb291cbe7da","amp;dn":"VMware+Virtual+SAN+Cookbook+%28DjShay12%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d61308ed4b515b147b80cd8a62f7bb291cbe7da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,97,48,142,212,181,21,177,71,184,12,216,166,47,123,178,145,203,231,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
