But as I see it, this kind of thing is the very heart of the subject. I dislike estheticism. For me Prose and Poetry belong to the world of vital interests, to those matters which affect the current of our days. They are less important than food and shelter, but as soon as we can sit back and reflect, they become important enough to be worth bothering about, even to the point of having a book written about them","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63e4eef92ae257478edf5579f6bc4c36f80c1541","amp;dn":"Appreciation+-+Painting%2C+Poetry+and+Prose+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63e4eef92ae257478edf5579f6bc4c36f80c1541","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,228,238,249,42,226,87,71,142,223,85,121,246,188,76,54,248,12,21,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
