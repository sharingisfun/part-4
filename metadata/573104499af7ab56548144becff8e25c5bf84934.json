At the same time it combines the straightforward focus on fundamentals instructors have come to expect with a modern emphasis on design and new applications. Overall coverage of basic concepts are clear and concise so that readers can easily navigate key topics. This edition includes a new case study to help illuminate the complexities of shafts and axles and a new finite elements chapter. Problem sets have been improved, with new problems added to help students progressively work through them. The book website includes ARIS, which is a homework management system that will have 90 algorithmic problems.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 1088 pages\n# Publisher: McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math; 8 edition (October 25, 2006)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0073312606\n# ISBN-13: 978-0073312606","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:573104499af7ab56548144becff8e25c5bf84934","amp;dn":"Shigley%5C%27s+Mechanical+Engineering+Design%2C8th+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"573104499af7ab56548144becff8e25c5bf84934","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,49,4,73,154,247,171,86,84,129,68,190,207,248,226,92,91,248,73,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
