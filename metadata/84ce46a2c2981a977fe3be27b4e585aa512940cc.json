The release includes a solo album from both of the group's members. Speakerboxxx has Big Boi performing tracks more representative of the older OutKast style, while The Love Below, the solo project of AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© 3000, is performed in a more funk-based style. AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© primarily sings rather than rapping on The Love Below, marking a significant departure from his past work by OutKast. Speakerboxxx/The Love Below won Album of the Year, the first rap album so honored, and Best Rap Album at the Grammy Awards of 2004.rme","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84ce46a2c2981a977fe3be27b4e585aa512940cc","amp;dn":"Outkast+-+Speakerboxxx+-+The+Love+Below+%5B+FLAC+%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84ce46a2c2981a977fe3be27b4e585aa512940cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,206,70,162,194,152,26,151,127,227,190,39,180,229,133,170,81,41,64,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
