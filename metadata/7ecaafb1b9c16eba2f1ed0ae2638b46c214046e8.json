In Social D, he stuck mostly to punk rock, with the exception of 1992Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s fantastic  Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell, which had a very heavy country/honky tonk influence.  Cheating at Solitaire picks up from this point and moves further away from the punk rock and closer to the country. Along the way, the album picks up some more influences, including a bit of blues and some greasy rockabilly.\n\nThis abum is a must have in my opinion. But what do i know. Im a Social D junkie! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ecaafb1b9c16eba2f1ed0ae2638b46c214046e8","amp;dn":"Mike+Ness+-+Cheating+At+Solitaire+%281999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ecaafb1b9c16eba2f1ed0ae2638b46c214046e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,202,175,177,185,193,110,186,47,30,208,174,38,56,180,108,33,64,70,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
