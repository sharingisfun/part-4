Four years later, Live From Manticore Hall captures nine intimate versions of ELP tunes, a little King Crimson, and even a Q&amp;A. The tour would serve as a precursor to Emerson, Lake and PalmerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2010 High Voltage reunion in London, speculated to be the final ELP reunion.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“From the Beginning,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which starts off with some inspiring piano work from Emerson, flows with a strong Greg Lake vocal and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear at once that this is the strongest his voice has been in a while. When Lake plays his acoustic and Emerson counters with some laidback piano, it demonstrates how the two musicians challenged themselves by changing up the arrangements in some fun and unusual ways. Lake goes on to introduce the King Crimson classic Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Talk To The WindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as a song he hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t performed since 1969. On this version, his voice sounds wonderful and EmersonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s piano runs behind and under LakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s acoustic fill in beautifully.\n\n\n\nEmerson offers a funny anecdote about ELPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s origins (Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Nice what?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½) before launching into Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bitches Crystal.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ This one sees the keyboard wizardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s speedy dexterity, along with LakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first turn on bass, in a solid barrelhouse send-up. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Barbarian,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ from ELPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1970 self-titled debut and introduced as an Ã¢â‚¬Å“annoyingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ instrumental that Ã¢â‚¬Å“grows on you,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ finds Emerson switching between Hammond and piano with some gurgling synths and drums from the engineer supposedly behind an on-stage glass partition Ã¢â‚¬â€ as if Emerson and Lake were in a recording studio.\n\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Take A PebbleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ features Lake singing at the high end of his range with Emerson recreating his piano parts to the letter. Just before the acoustic guitar break, Emerson starts the distinctive left hand runs-on, seguing into the Ã¢â‚¬Å“TarkusÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ suite. LakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals are strong on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stones of Years,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s some truly inspired bass and piano dueting on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mass.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Emerson switches to synth for a rousing Ã¢â‚¬Å“AquatarkusÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to end the whole concoction.\n\n\n\nWhen I caught this tour in New York City, I thought Ã¢â‚¬Å“PiratesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was a strange choice for the setlist, and overall I would have preferred more piano and acoustic guitar duets. On this CD, the song suffers from the canned drums, though Lake and Emerson are in fine playing form. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s especially nice to hear LakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bass parts front and center. The CD ends with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lucky Man.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Lake tells a story of the songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s origins and Emerson Ã¢â‚¬Å“experimentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ with a synth solo before playing a lush piano opening. And yes, the synth lead at the end kicks ass as it always does! Live From Manticore Hall is a treat for ELP fans who love the original trio, will take a duet when it happens, and want to relive an evening filled with classics.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f1aa22ad32d36e7e2403f955bb9fbeac8f5e161","amp;dn":"Keith+Emerson+%26amp%3B+Greg+Lake+-+Live+From+Manticore+Hall+%282014%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f1aa22ad32d36e7e2403f955bb9fbeac8f5e161","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,26,162,42,211,45,54,231,226,64,63,149,91,185,251,234,200,245,225,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
