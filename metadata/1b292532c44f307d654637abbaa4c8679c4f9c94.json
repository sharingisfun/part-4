The first settled line-up consisted of Brian Jones (guitar, harmonica), Ian Stewart (piano), Mick Jagger (lead vocals, harmonica), Keith Richards (guitar), Bill Wyman (bass) and Charlie Watts (drums). Jones left the band less than a month prior to his death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who left in 1975. Since then Ronnie Wood has been on guitar in tandem with Richards. Following Wyman's departure in 1993, Darryl Jones has been the main bassist. Stewart was removed from the official lineup in 1963 but continued as occasional pianist until his death in 1985. Other notable keyboardist for the band have included Nicky Hopkins, active from 1967 to 1982, and Chuck Leavell, active since 1982. The band was first led by Jones, but after teaming as the band's songwriters, Jagger and Richards assumed defacto leadership.\n\nThe Rolling Stones were in the vanguard of the British Invasion of bands that became popular in the US in 1964Ã¢â‚¬â€œ65. At first noted for their longish hair as much as their music, the band are identified with the youthful and rebellious counterculture of the 1960s. They were instrumental in making blues a major part of rock and roll, and of changing the international focus of blues culture to the less sophisticated blues typified by Chess Records artists such as Muddy Waters, writer of &quot;Rollin' Stone&quot;, the song after which the band is named. Musicologist Robert Palmer attributed the &quot;remarkable endurance&quot; of the Rolling Stones to being &quot;rooted in traditional verities, in rhythm-and-blues and soul music&quot; while &quot;more ephemeral pop fashions have come and gone&quot;.\n\nThe Rolling Stones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. Rolling Stone magazine ranked them fourth on the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot; list, and their estimated album sales are above 250 million. They have released twenty-nine studio albums, eighteen live albums and numerous compilations. Let It Bleed (1969) was their first of five consecutive number one studio and Live albums in the UK. Sticky Fingers (1971) was the first of eight consecutive number one studio albums in the US. In 2008 the band ranked 10th on the &quot;Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists&quot; chart. In 2012, the band celebrated their 50th anniversary.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b292532c44f307d654637abbaa4c8679c4f9c94","amp;dn":"Rolling+Stones+21+SACD-R%27s+1964-1986%28Hi-+Res+Stereo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b292532c44f307d654637abbaa4c8679c4f9c94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,41,37,50,196,79,48,125,101,70,55,171,186,164,200,103,156,79,156,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
