A. MILNE (1882-1956), requires no introduction.  The first collection of stories about the character was the book WINNIE-THE-POOH (1926), followed by THE HOUSE AT POOH CORNER (1928).  Milne also included a poem about the bear in the children's verse book WHEN WE WERE VERY YOUNG (1924) and many more in NOW WE ARE SIX (1927).  All four volumes were illustrated by Ernest H. Shepard.\n\nRETURN TO THE HUNDRED ACRE WOOD (2009) is a collection of stories written by David Benedictus and illustrated by Mark Burgess.  It was approved for publication by the trustees of the Milne estate and was the first such book since 1928, introducing the character Lottie the Otter.\n\n\nAll 5 individual volumes are here in both EPUB and MOBI formats.  In addition, the WINNIE-THE-POOH DELUXE GIFT BOX edition (Dutton, 2009), comprising all 5 books in one volume, is included as a PDF.\n\n* THE HOUSE AT POOH CORNER (Dutton, 2009) -- EPUB + MOBI\n\n* NOW WE ARE SIX (Dutton, 2009) -- EPUB + MOBI\n\n* RETURN TO THE HUNDRED ACRE WOOD (Dutton, 2009).
