Within weeks, their self-titled debut CD was available in record stores.  \n\nGodsmacks first single &quot;Whatever&quot; broke through the concrete wall of American popular music, quickly soaring to the No. 3 spot on the Billboard charts, where it remained for an incredible \n53 straight weeks.\n\nRobbie Merrill is the Grammy nominated bassist for the multi-platinum rock band Godsmack. \n\nShannon Larkin is the explosive drummer of the band Godsmack. His distinct approach to drumming and ballistic stage presence have made him a dominant force in arenas and in the studio.\n__________\n\n 1. Cryin Like A Bitch\n  \n 2. Saints and Sinners\n  \n 3.
