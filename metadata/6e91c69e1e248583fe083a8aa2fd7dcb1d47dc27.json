Nuttall\nRead by Jeffrey Kafer\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\nUnabridged\n\nYou should never speak truth to powerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nThe Galactic Empire is dying and chaos and anarchy are breaking out everywhere. After a disastrous mission against terrorists on Earth itself, Captain Edward Stalker of the Terran Marine Corps makes the mistake of speaking truth to power, telling one of the most powerful men in the Empire a few home truths. As a result, Captain Stalker and his men are unceremoniously exiled to Avalon, a world right on the Rim of the Empire. It should have been an easy posting....\nWell, apart from the bandits infesting the countryside, an insurgency that threatens to topple the Empire's loose control over Avalon, and a corrupt civil government more interested in what it can extort from the population than fighting a war. The Marines rapidly find themselves caught up in a whirlwind of political and economic chaos, fighting to preserve Avalon before the competing factions tear the world apart. They're Marines; if anyone can do it, they can.\nThe battle to save the Empire starts here","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e91c69e1e248583fe083a8aa2fd7dcb1d47dc27","amp;dn":"Christopher+G.+Nuttall+-+The+Empire%26rsquo%3Bs+Corps+%28The+Empire%26rs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e91c69e1e248583fe083a8aa2fd7dcb1d47dc27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,145,198,158,30,36,133,131,254,8,58,138,162,253,125,203,29,71,220,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
