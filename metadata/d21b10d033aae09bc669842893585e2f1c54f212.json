It was held at Max Yasgur's 600-acre (2.4 kmÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â²; 240 ha, 0.94 miÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â²) dairy farm near the hamlet of White Lake in the town of Bethel, New York, from August 15 to August 18, 1969. Bethel, in Sullivan County, is 43 miles (69 km) southwest of the town of Woodstock, New York, in adjoining Ulster County.\n\nDuring the sometimes rainy weekend, thirty-two acts performed outdoors in front of 500,000 concert-goers.[2] It is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most pivotal moments in popular music history and was listed among Rolling Stone's 50 Moments That Changed the History of Rock and Roll.[3]\n\nThe event was captured in the successful 1970 documentary movie Woodstock, an accompanying soundtrack album, and Joni Mitchell's song &quot;Woodstock&quot; which commemorated the event and became a major hit for Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic From The Original Soundtrack 1970\n\n\nWoodstock: Music from the Original Soundtrack and More is the live album of the 1969 Woodstock concert. Originally released on Atlantic Records' Cotillion label as a set of 3 LPs in 1970 (later reissued on the Atlantic label), it was re-released as a double CD in 1994. Veteran producer Eddie Kramer was the sound engineer during the three-day event.\n\nThis triple album set of the monumental outdoor concert features Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young performing live for only the second time. The performance of &quot;Sea Of Madness&quot; by Neil Young actually heard on the record, however, was in fact recorded a month after the festival at the Fillmore East auditorium in New York City.\n\nA second collection of recordings from the festival, Woodstock 2, was released a year later. In 1994 the songs from both albums, as well as numerous additional, previously-unreleased performances from the festival, but not the stage announcements and crowd noises, were reissued by Atlantic as a 4-CD box set titled Woodstock: Three Days of Peace and Music. In 2009, Rhino Records issued a 6-CD box, Woodstock: 40 Years On: Back to Yasgur's Farm, which includes further musical performances as well as stage announcements and other ancillary material.\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n\nDisc 1 \n\nI Had a Dream - John Benson Sebastian\nGoing Up the Country/Stage Announcements - Canned Heat\nFreedom - Richie Havens\nRock &amp; Soul Music - Country Joe &amp; the Fish\nComing into Los Angeles - Arlo Guthrie\nAt the Hop - Sha Na Na\n&quot;Fish&quot; Cheer/I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-To-Die Rag, The - Country Joe McDonald\nDrug Store Truck Drivin' Man - Jeffrey Shurtleff/Joan Baez\nJoe Hill/Stage Announcements - Joan Baez\nSuite: Judy Blue Eyes - Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash\nSea of Madness - Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young\nWooden Ships - Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young\nWe're Not Gonna Take It (From &quot;Tommy&quot;)/Stage Announcements - The Who\nWith a Little Help From My Friends/Rainstorm/Crowd Sounds/Announcements/General Hysteria - Joe Cocker\n\n\n\nDisc 2 \n\n\nCrowd Rain Chants/Soul Sacrifice - Santana\nI'm Going Home - Ten Years After\nVolunteers - Jefferson Airplane\nMedley: Dance to the Music/Music Lover/I Want to Take You Higher - Sly &amp; the Family Stone\nRainbows All Over Your Blues - John Benson Sebastian\nLove March - The Paul Butterfield Blues Band\nMedley: Star Spangled Banner/Purple Haze/Instrumental Solo - Jimi Hendrix\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d21b10d033aae09bc669842893585e2f1c54f212","amp;dn":"Woodstock+-+Original+Soundtrack+2009+%282+CD%29+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d21b10d033aae09bc669842893585e2f1c54f212","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,27,16,208,51,170,224,155,198,105,132,40,147,88,94,47,28,84,242,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
