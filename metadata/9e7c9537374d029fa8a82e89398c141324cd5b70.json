This one comes like a piece of collecting heaven, where even the tracks have titles like &quot;Music For Travel Scenes&quot;, &quot;Music for Water Activities&quot;, &quot;Music for Family Fun&quot;, etc.\n\nI have other &quot;music for home movie&quot; records, but this one seems to be the best I've ever come across. The instrumentals are great, and sound like they were ripped off the soundtracks of Mental Hygene films of the 50's. My favorite track is &quot;Music for Children's Activities&quot;.&quot;\n\nThis is a hilarious timepiece. also has a good crowd noise, the classic &quot;boing&quot; that sounds like its straight out of the three stooges, traffic noises... but the good stuff is the 50s &quot;everything's great,keen, swell, and A-OK!&quot; music. Reminds me of the background music on the old Ren and Stimpy show. \n\nGreat for anyone that loves obscurities.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e7c9537374d029fa8a82e89398c141324cd5b70","amp;dn":"Sound+8+Background+Music%2FNoises+Vinyl+Rip+50s+192kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e7c9537374d029fa8a82e89398c141324cd5b70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,124,149,55,55,77,2,159,168,168,46,137,57,140,20,19,36,205,91,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
