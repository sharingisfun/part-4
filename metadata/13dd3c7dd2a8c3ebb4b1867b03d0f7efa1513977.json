With Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life you can follow her life story, from her childhood in the turbulent years of revolution in her native Russia to her great success as a popular writer and deep thinker in the United States. This comprehensive look at a fascinating woman uses interviews with friends and colleagues, family photos, clips of her speaking, and great moments from the films she wrote to portray a complex, passionate person with the brains to articulate her ideals and the guts to stand up for them. Trying to get work in 1930s Hollywood wasn't easy for such a rabid anti-Communist, but Rand persisted and the tales of her life in the theater, her lifelong relationship with actor Frank O'Connor, and her midlife career change from novelist to political philosopher are both inspiring and dramatic, just as she'd want them to be.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118662/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118662/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13dd3c7dd2a8c3ebb4b1867b03d0f7efa1513977","amp;dn":"Ayn+Rand+-+A+Sense+of+Life+-+1997+-+Xvid+-+velvetfog","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13dd3c7dd2a8c3ebb4b1867b03d0f7efa1513977","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,221,60,125,210,168,195,235,180,177,134,123,3,208,247,239,161,81,57,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
