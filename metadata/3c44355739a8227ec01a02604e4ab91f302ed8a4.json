As Ira Gershwin said, in the line quoted in every obituary: &quot;I never knew how good our songs were until I heard Ella Fitzgerald sing them.&quot; Most of the rest of us didn't know, either. By the time she had gone through the entire canon, songs that had been pigeonholed as show tunes or jazz novelties or faded relics of Tin Pan Alley had become American classical music, the property and pride of everyone.&quot; [2]\n\nFrank Sinatra was moved out of respect for Fitzgerald to block Capitol from re-releasing his own albums in a similar, single composer vein.\n\nVerve reissued the eight albums in 1994 in this expansive boxset, which won the 1995 Grammy for Best Historical Recording.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c44355739a8227ec01a02604e4ab91f302ed8a4","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Ella+Fitzgerald+Song+Books+%5BFlac%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c44355739a8227ec01a02604e4ab91f302ed8a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,68,53,87,57,168,34,126,192,26,2,96,78,74,185,31,48,46,216,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
