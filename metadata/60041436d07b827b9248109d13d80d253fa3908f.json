Groover (Wiley, 2007).pdf\r\n\r\nIn this introductory book, Groover not only takes a modern, all-inclusive look at manufacturing processes but also provides substantial coverage of engineering materials and production systems. It follows a more quantitative and design-oriented approach than other texts in the market, helping readers gain a better understanding of important concepts. Theyâ€™ll also discover how material properties relate to the process variables in a given process as well as how to perform manufacturing science and quantitative engineering analysis of manufacturing processes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60041436d07b827b9248109d13d80d253fa3908f","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Modern+Manufacturing+3rd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60041436d07b827b9248109d13d80d253fa3908f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,4,20,54,208,123,130,123,146,72,16,157,19,216,13,37,63,163,144,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
