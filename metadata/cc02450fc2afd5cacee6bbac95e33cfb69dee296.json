During the 1970s, Raitt released a series of acclaimed roots-influenced albums which incorporated elements of blues, rock, folk and country, but she is perhaps best known for her more commercially accessible recordings in the 1990s including &quot;Nick of Time&quot;, &quot;Something to Talk About&quot;, &quot;Love Sneakin' Up on You&quot;, and the slow ballad &quot;I Can't Make You Love Me&quot;. Raitt has received nine Grammy Awards in her career and is a lifelong political activist.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc02450fc2afd5cacee6bbac95e33cfb69dee296","amp;dn":"Bonnie+Raitt+-+14+Albums+1974+-+2012+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc02450fc2afd5cacee6bbac95e33cfb69dee296","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,2,69,15,194,175,213,202,206,230,187,172,149,227,60,251,105,222,226,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
