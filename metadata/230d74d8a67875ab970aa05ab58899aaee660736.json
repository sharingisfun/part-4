The album also includes a sweltering cover of Albert King's classic &quot;Can't You See What You're Doing To Me&quot;.\n\nAna was born in Belgrade and quickly took to the guitar at 15 after uncovering her father's impressive collection of blues and soul records. She's turned heads at festivals around the world, shared stages with Buddy Guy, BB King and Taj Mahal, and has been nominated for a total of four Blues Music Awards.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:230d74d8a67875ab970aa05ab58899aaee660736","amp;dn":"Ana+Popovic+-+Can+You+Stand+The+Heat+%282013%29+Album+%40+320+Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"230d74d8a67875ab970aa05ab58899aaee660736","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,13,116,216,166,120,117,171,151,10,160,90,181,136,153,170,238,102,7,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
