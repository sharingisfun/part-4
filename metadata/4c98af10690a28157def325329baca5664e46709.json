It was written by Knowles, Rich Harrison, Jay-Z for Knowles&amp;#039; debut solo album Dangerously in Love. The track was produced by Harrison and Knowles using a sample from The Chi-Lites&amp;#039; 1970 &quot;Are You My Woman (Tell Me So)&quot; that serves as the song&amp;#039;s horn hook.\n\nReleased as the lead single from the album on July 8, 2003, it reached number one in the charts of United States and the United Kingdom, and the top ten of many charts worldwide. &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; was critically acclaimed and has earned Knowles several awards.\n\nThe music video of &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;, released in May 2003, was filmed by English director Jake Nava. The video showcases Knowles in various dance sequences. The opening scene begins with Knowles wearing a tank top, shorts, and red high-heels. She performs an elaborate solo dance on a riser. The scene shifts to a gold set detailing a mock photo shoot, before moving into a scene with dancers detailing Knowles and dancing against a wall while wearing caps and full length pants. She is dancing to Jay-Z&amp;#039;s solo rap in an exotic silk print over a fur coat, and kicks a fire hydrant. She continues to dance while the water is flying all over the place. The video ends with Knowles and her dancers in front of a giant fan in vibrant dresses in contrast to the more neutral colors of the background.\n\nThe music video received acclaim from video-awarding organizations. &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; won three at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards in the categories of Best Female Video, Best R&amp;B Video, and Best Choreography.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c98af10690a28157def325329baca5664e46709","amp;dn":"Beyonce+featuring+Jay+Z+-+Crazy+In+Love","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c98af10690a28157def325329baca5664e46709","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,152,175,16,105,10,40,21,125,239,50,83,41,186,202,86,100,228,103,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
