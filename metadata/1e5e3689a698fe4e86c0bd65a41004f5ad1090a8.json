As they have only a few hours until his plane leaves, they stroll through Paris, talking about their experiences, views and whether they still love each other, although Jesse is already married with a kid.\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments on IMDB : \n\n\nI had not seen the prequel to this although my date had and she filled me in on many details. While the experience of this film would be enriched by having seen the preceding film first, it certainly stands satisfactorily alone.\n\nIn many ways, this reminded me very much of one of my most favorite movies of all time, &quot;My Dinner with AndrÃƒÂ©,&quot; in which just 2 characters talking comprised the whole movie. In that movie, the friends had been close, drifted apart, and then had a brief reunion at a dinner at which they caught up with what the other had been doing. The two principals, AndrÃƒÂ© Gregory and Wallace Shawn, played themselves and each represented a one side of a dialectic, say the side of romanticism vs. a conventional reality. &quot;Before Sunset&quot; is parallel in many ways.\n\nAt one level we have a romantic story -- two people who&amp;#039;d briefly been lovers nine years before and lost touch meet again. They spend an afternoon together. Will they try to fulfill what they&amp;#039;d started?\n\nAt another level, we have the charm of conversation and exploration, of reminiscing, of gradually feeling out and discovery of how much do I have in common with this person now? -- where has this person been? -- what are they capable of now? -- how much freedom of choice do I have, does this other person have -- to make decisions? Etc.\n\nWhile Celine and Jesse have a capacity for relating and talking, they also have somewhat opposite ways of viewing the world and relationships -- Celine is more cynical and reserved; Jesse is more open to settling for the &quot;not-perfect-but-good-enough.&quot; There are possibly a few people who have not had the personal experiences that at least somewhat relate to the premise in this film -- a relationship in which one wonders, &quot;what would have happened if I&amp;#039;d pursued that relation?&quot; but probably most people have. And the other dilemma, of meeting again that someone but by now being involved in relationships of responsibility -- my family, my children, my present life. What would it do to them if I were to pursue my own happiness at the expense of them? Can I do that? Can I value the chance of my own happiness above theirs? Etc.\n\nThe film, fortunately, gives us no answers to these essential questions but it does pose them in a way that makes us consider them.\n\nDelpy and Hawke are given screenwriter credits and I feel sure that they must&amp;#039;ve contributed a great deal to the feeling of seamless, natural dialogue.\n\nGREAT movie. No movie satisfies everyone, of course, but at the time I wrote this, slightly over 50% of the voters gave it a 10/10. For those of us in that group, it&amp;#039;s a great film.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e5e3689a698fe4e86c0bd65a41004f5ad1090a8","amp;dn":"Before+Sunset%5B2004%5D%5BDvDrip%5D%5BEng%5D%5BMustWatch%5D%5BBandwidthWasters%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e5e3689a698fe4e86c0bd65a41004f5ad1090a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,94,54,137,166,152,254,78,134,192,189,101,164,16,4,245,173,16,144,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
