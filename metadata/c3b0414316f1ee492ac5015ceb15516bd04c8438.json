This is my first torrent. I don't know the seeding will work or not. Fingers crossed!\n\n\nI'm bringing you the CLS MD81/82 AND MD87. I haven't found either working on the web. These come directly from the developer, original installers and serials.\n\nFSX Only by the way.\n\nThey're in a folder so you can choose if you only want the basepack or just the expansion. Just to make it easier. \n\nIf you read the readme you'll see what I'm about to type too:\n\nI don't know if it will ask for serials. It didn't for me, but its already installed on my computer so I don't know.\n\nJust letting you know.\n\n\nThats about it.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nPS I have the Justflight BAe-146 but I don't know if it'll work on any computer but mine. Haven't tried it on any others.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3b0414316f1ee492ac5015ceb15516bd04c8438","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%5DCLS+MD81%2F82+and+MD87+with+serial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3b0414316f1ee492ac5015ceb15516bd04c8438","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,176,65,67,22,241,238,73,42,197,1,92,235,21,81,107,208,76,132,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
