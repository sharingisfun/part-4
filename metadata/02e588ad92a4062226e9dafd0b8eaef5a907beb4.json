Hall\n\n\nPhilosophical Research Society | 1978 | ISBN: 0893145467 | Pages: 254 | PDF | 2.68 MB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimply put, this is the most beautiful and complete occult book ever published. It represents a lifetime of research into the mythology, symbolism, and magical practices of countless cultures.\n\n\n&quot;For once, a book which really lives up to its title. Hall self-published this massive tome in 1928, consisting of about 200 legal-sized pages in 8 point type; it is literally his magnum opus. Each of the nearly 50 chapters is so dense with information that it is the equivalent of an entire short book. If you read this book in its entirety you will be in a good position to dive into subjects such as the Qabbala, Alchemy, Tarot, Ceremonial Magic, Neo-Platonic Philosophy, Mystery Religions, and the theory of Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry. Although there are some questionable and controversial parts of the book, such as the outdated material on Islam, the portion on the Bacon-Shakespeare hypothesis, and Hall's conspiracy theory of history as driven by an elite cabal of roving immortals, they are far out-weighed by the comprehensive information here on other subjects.&quot; (Quote from sacred-texts.com)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents:\n\n\n\nPublisher's Preface; Preface; Introduction; The Ancient Mysteries And Secret Societies Which Have Influenced Modern Masonic Symbolism; The Ancient Mysteries And Secret Societies, Part Two; The Ancient Mysteries And Secret Societies, Part Three; Atlantis And The Gods Of Antiquity; The Life And Teachings Of Thoth Hermes Trismegistus; The Initiation Of The Pyramid; Isis, The virgin Of The World; The Sun, A Universal Deity; The Zodiac And Its Signs; The Terbembine Table Of Isis; Wonders Of Antiquity; The Life And Philosophy Of Pythagoras; Pythagorean Mathematics; The Human Body In Symbolism; The Hiramic Legend; The Pythagorean Theory Of Music And Color; Fishes, Insects, Animals, Reptiles And Birds (part One); Fishes, Insects, Animals, Reptiles And Birds (part Two); Flowers, Plants, Fruits, And Trees; Stones, Metals And Gems; Ceremonial Magic And Sorcery; The Elements And Their Inhabitants; Hermetic Pharmacology, Chemistry, And Therapeutics; The Qabbalah, The Secret Doctrine Of Israel; Fundamentals Of Qabbalistic Cosmogony; The Tree Of The Sephiroth; Qabbalistic Keys To The Creation Of Man; An Analysis Of Tarot Cards; The Tabernacle In The Wilderness; The Fraternity Of The Rose Cross; Rosicrucian Doctrines And Tenets; Fifteen Rosicrucian And Qabbalistic Diagrams; Alchemy And Its Exponents; The Theory And Practice Of Alchemy: Part One; The Theory And Practice Of Alchemy: Part Two; The Hermetic And Alchemical Figures Of Claudius De Dominico Celentano Vallis Novi; The Chemical Marriage; Bacon, Shakspere, And The Rosicrucians; The Cryptogram As A Factor In Symbolic Philosophy; Freemasonic Symbolism; Mystic Christianity; The Cross And The Crucifixion; The Mystery Of The Apocalypse; The Faith Of Islam; American Indian Symbolism; The Mysteries And Their Emissaries; Conclusion\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\n\n\n&quot;Manly Palmer Hall (March 18, 1901 - August 29, 1990) was a Canadian-born author and mystic. He is perhaps most famous for his work The Secret Teachings of All Ages: An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy, which is widely regarded as his magnum opus, published in 1928 when he was just 27 years old.\n\nHe has been widely recognized as a leading scholar in the fields of religion, mythology, mysticism, and the occult.\n\nCarl Jung, when writing Psychology and Alchemy, borrowed material from Hall's private collection.\n\nIn 1934, Hall founded the Philosophical Research Society (PRS) in Los Angeles, California, dedicating it to an idealistic approach to the solution of human problems. The PRS claims to be non-sectarian and entirely free from educational, political, or ecclesiastical control, and the Society's programs stress the need for the integration of philosophy, religion, and science into one system of instruction. The PRS Library, a public facility devoted to source materials in obscure fields, has many rare and scarce items now impossible to obtain elsewhere.\n\nIn 1973 (47 years after writing The Secret Teachings of All Ages), Hall was recognized as a 33Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âº Mason (the highest honor conferred by the Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite), at a ceremony held at PRS on December 8th, despite never being initiated into the physical craft.\n\nIn his over 70-year career, Hall delivered approximately 8,000 lectures in the United States and abroad, authored over 150 books and essays, and wrote countless magazine articles.&quot; - wiki\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02e588ad92a4062226e9dafd0b8eaef5a907beb4","amp;dn":"The+Secret+Teachings+of+All+Ages+%281928%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02e588ad92a4062226e9dafd0b8eaef5a907beb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,229,136,173,146,164,6,34,38,233,218,253,11,142,174,245,169,7,190,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
