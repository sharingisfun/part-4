Character design and artwork are by Alecos Papadatos and color is by Annie Di Donna. The book was originally written in English, and was translated into Greek by author Apostolos Doxiadis for the release in Greece, which preceded the US and UK releases.\n\nSet between the late 19th century and present-day, the graphic novel Logicomix is based on the story of the so-called &quot;foundational quest&quot; in mathematics.\n\nLogicomix intertwines the philosophical struggles with the characters' own personal turmoil. These are in turn played out just upstage of the momentous historical events of the era and the ideological battles which gave rise to them. The narrator of the story is Bertrand Russell, who stands as an icon of many of these themes: a deeply sensitive and introspective man, Russell was not just a philosopher and pacifist, he was also one of the prominent figures in the foundational quest. Russell's life story, depicted by Logicomix, is itself a journey through the goals and struggles, and triumph and tragedy shared by many great thinkers of the 20th century: Georg Cantor, Ludwig Wittgenstein, G. E. Moore, Alfred North Whitehead, David Hilbert, Gottlob Frege, Henri PoincarÃƒÂ©, Kurt GÃƒÂ¶del, and Alan Turing.\n\nA parallel tale, set in present-day Athens, records the creators' disagreement on the meaning of the story, thus setting in relief the foundational quest as a quintessentially modern adventure. It is on the one hand a tragedy of the hubris of rationalism, which descends inextricably on madness, and on the other an origin myth of the computer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85dcd8ce3311135567d9a30ae9cac6936dda2d86","amp;dn":"Logicomix+-+An+Epic+Search+For+Truth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85dcd8ce3311135567d9a30ae9cac6936dda2d86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,220,216,206,51,17,19,85,103,217,163,10,233,202,198,147,109,218,45,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
