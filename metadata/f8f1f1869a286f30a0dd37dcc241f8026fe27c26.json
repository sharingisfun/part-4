When the class attempts to make a living hell out of YankumiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career, they fail as her persistence and aggression gain her respect. However, little does anyone in the school know that Yankumi is actually heir to the Oedo Group Ã¢â‚¬â€œ one of TokyoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most powerful yakuza clans. If anyone finds out that Yankumi is a yakuza member, her career as a teacher could be in jeopardy.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8f1f1869a286f30a0dd37dcc241f8026fe27c26","amp;dn":"Gokusen+%28J-Drama%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8f1f1869a286f30a0dd37dcc241f8026fe27c26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,241,241,134,154,40,111,48,160,221,55,220,194,65,248,2,111,226,124,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
