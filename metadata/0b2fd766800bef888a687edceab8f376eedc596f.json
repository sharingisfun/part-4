Al-Malah (Wiley, 2017).pdf\r\n\r\nFacilitates the process of learning and later mastering Aspen PlusÂ® with step by step examples and succinct explanations\r\n\r\nAspen PlusÂ® is a full-fledge package that can be cumbersome for beginners. It is a very powerful tool that can be used to tackle different chemical process &amp; unit operation calculation-based tasks, in the form of modelling, simulation, optimization, data regression, design specifications, sensitivity analysis, solids handling, dynamics and control, energy saving, safety compliance, and finally process economic analysis. \r\n\r\nMade up of eighteen chapters,Aspen PlusÂ®: Chemical Engineering Applications constitutes running tutorials that mainly cover common unit operations or chemical processes found in chemical industries. Moreover, the book has end of chapter contextual problems. The last chapter is made of comprehensive problems (or term projects) that require an extensive knowledge of Aspen PlusÂ® features and tools that are already explained in previous chapters.\r\n\r\nAspen PlusÂ®: Chemical Engineering Applications features:\r\n\r\nExplanations of need to know aspects of Aspen PlusÂ® without providing overwhelming details and avoiding cumbersome Aspen PlusÂ® features\r\nA running tutorial that the reader can refer to when doing homework, class work, term project, or even individual projects\r\nApplications to classical chemical processes and unit operations and special processes such as electrolytes, polymerization, drug characterization, and solids handling\r\nContextual problems at the end of each chapter and one last dedicated chapter that encompasses term project problems\r\nThis textbook is structured as a recipe- or cookbook-type guide with solution for problems algorithmically presented via successive images (i.e., snapshots for the relevant Aspen PlusÂ® platform) in parallel with the textual explanation. Once the chemical engineer masters such a powerful tool, they can use it in their daily professional life. The book can be recommended to all chemical engineering unions, chapters, and organizations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b2fd766800bef888a687edceab8f376eedc596f","amp;dn":"Aspen+Plus%26reg%3B+-+Chemical+Engineering+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b2fd766800bef888a687edceab8f376eedc596f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,47,215,102,128,11,239,136,138,104,126,220,234,184,243,118,238,220,89,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
