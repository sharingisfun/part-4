Gameplay is inspired by point-and-click adventure games (like the classic Monkey Island or King's Quest series, or more recently Telltale's Walking Dead series), but focused on characterization, atmosphere and storytelling rather than clever puzzles or challenges of skill.\n\nThe game is developed by Cardboard Computer (Jake Elliott and Tamas Kemenczy). The game's soundtrack features an original electronic score by Ben Babbitt along with a suite of old hymns &amp; bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers.\n\n! Notice\nThe first act of the game is also included. To play the second act select Start Act II from the main menu.\n\nIf you like the game, BUY it!\n\nwww.kentuckyroutezero.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcbe96698d12d1006ff90854ec3bc74912334594","amp;dn":"Kentucky++Route++Zero++Act++II++MAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcbe96698d12d1006ff90854ec3bc74912334594","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,190,150,105,141,18,209,0,111,249,8,84,236,59,199,73,18,51,69,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
