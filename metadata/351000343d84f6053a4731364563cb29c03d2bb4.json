Those hours, however, are widely regarded to be among the best of Pryor's career. His mixture of political satire and sharp wit kept guests John Belushi, Maya Angelou, Robin Williams, Sandra Bernhard and more on their toes.\n\nCast:\nRichard Pryor, Robin Williams, Sandra Bernhard, Shirley Hemphill, Paul Mooney, LaWanda Page, Tim Reid, Edie McClurg, Marsha Warfield, Peter Cullen, John Belushi, Maya Angelou\n\nDescription from Netflix\n\nAs always...
