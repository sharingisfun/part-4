The album was released in July 2001 via Mercury Records. Despite it being the band's first album not to reach the top 10 in the UK since Strip-mine (excepting the experimental Wah Wah), the album was widely regarded as one of their best pieces of work. Indeed, Allmusic described the album as their &quot;tightest, freshest, most contemporary batch of songs, weatherproofed to stand the test of time&quot;. One single, &quot;Getting Away With It (All Messed Up)&quot;, was released from the album.\n\nThe album's front cover features a composite image of all the band members' faces.\n\nTrack listing\n\n    &quot;Space&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:49\n    &quot;Falling Down&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:36\n    &quot;English Beefcake&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:46\n    &quot;Junkie&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:56\n    &quot;Pleased to Meet You&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:37\n    &quot;The Shining&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:26\n    &quot;Senorita&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:10\n    &quot;Gaudi&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:17\n    &quot;What Is It Good For&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:12\n    &quot;Give It Away&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:05\n    &quot;Fine&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:41\n    &quot;Getting Away With It (All Messed Up)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:29\n    &quot;Alaskan Pipeline&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:28\n\n\n320kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c205cf92059aaf46aeb9cac67a061b75b235234","amp;dn":"James+%28band%29+-+Pleased+to+meet+you+%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c205cf92059aaf46aeb9cac67a061b75b235234","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,32,92,249,32,89,170,244,106,235,156,172,103,160,97,183,91,35,82,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
