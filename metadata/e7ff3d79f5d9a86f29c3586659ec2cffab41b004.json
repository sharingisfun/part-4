Out here, a dark-skinned womanâ€™s traditional hair color is honey blonde.â€) â€œPlayerâ€ tells the story of Kaling being seduced and dumped by a female friend in L.A. (â€œI had been replaced by a younger model. And now they had matching bangs.â€) In â€œUnlikely Leading Lady,â€ she muses on Americaâ€™s fixation with the weight of actresses, (â€œMost women we see onscreen are either so thin that theyâ€™re walking clavicles or so huge that their only scenes involve them breaking furniture.â€) And in â€œSoup Snakes,â€ Kaling spills some secrets on her relationship with her ex-boyfriend and close friend, B.J. Novak (â€œI will freely admit: my relationship with B.J. Novak is weird as hell.â€)\r\n\r\nMindy turns the anxieties, the glamour, and the celebrations of her second coming-of-age into a laugh-out-loud funny collection of essays that anyone whoâ€™s ever been at a turning point in their life or career can relate to. And those whoâ€™ve never been at a turning point can skip to the parts where she talks about meeting Bradley Cooper","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7ff3d79f5d9a86f29c3586659ec2cffab41b004","amp;dn":"Mindy+Kaling+-+Why+Not+Me%3F+%28Audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7ff3d79f5d9a86f29c3586659ec2cffab41b004","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,255,61,121,245,217,168,111,41,195,88,102,89,236,44,255,171,65,176,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
