I have replaced the corrupt files with fresh ones.\n\nNote: Before continuing, make sure that you are on 4.21 at least and have an online spoofer installed. \n \nI included a PKG that can spoof any 4.xx firmware to 4.65 (which is the absolute latest right now) \n\nHere's the steps to get it working properly:\n\n \nEU PLAYERS (people with EU accounts on psn)\n \n1. Install the 1.02 update\n2. Copy game to either PS3 or external drive\n3. Use MultiMan to mount it (MultiMan will automatically sign the eboot to your system version)\n4. Open the game. It will download some sort of package for 'compatibility'.\n5. Game should run now!\n\n\nUS OR OTHER PLAYERS (people without an EU account)\n\n1. Install the 1.02 update\n2. Install the compatibility pkg file\n3. Copy game to either PS3 or external drive\n4. Use MultiMan to mount it (MultiMan will automatically sign the eboot to your system version)\n5. Open the game. It will download some sort of package for 'compatibility'.\n6. Game should run now!\n\n(BEFORE PLAYING ON YOUR JAILBROKEN PS3 ONLINE, I SUGGEST USING AN APP TO HIDE YOUR JAILBREAK!)\n \nIf you don't know of one, I included the latest PSN Patch. And if you are using PSN Patch, follow these instructions:\n\n1. Use MultiMan to mount game\n2. Open the PSN Patch program\n3. Press triangle / to disable the syscalls and whatnot\n4. Open Destiny\n5. Play without worries! (or rather less worries)\n\nNote: After playing your game and whatnot, you can't open multiman to mount a new game. PSN Patch disables\npractically everything CFW can do. This is so that games can't just check if you're jailbroken (COD for example)\n\nJust reboot your system, open multiman, go to the settings menu (second to far left one) and scroll all the way\nto the bottom till you find the BD EMULATOR or whatever option. Change it to 'ENABLE' and you're good to go.\n \n \nThis game has been tested and is working on my 4.55 Rogero CFW PS3.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8e3a26d59bdce02ca72fac78d53a45890082423","amp;dn":"Destiny+%5BBLES01857%5D+%2B+FIXES+%26amp%3B+UPDATES+%284.21%2B+ONLY%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8e3a26d59bdce02ca72fac78d53a45890082423","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,227,162,109,89,189,206,2,202,114,250,199,141,83,164,88,144,8,36,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
