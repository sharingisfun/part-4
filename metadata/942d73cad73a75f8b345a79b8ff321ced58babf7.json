Flirting is how you send the message that you're interested without saying so directly. If you do it well, you can keep your prospect amused, giddy, titillated, flattered, and insulted all at the same time. Flirting is also how you establish that you have a sense of humor, that you're smart, and that you're sane. And it's how you tell whether your prospect has those same qualities. If both of you are in the right mood, these routines can be great fun. The book is divided into two sections, one for women and the other for men. Since it is usually the man who does the chasing and the woman who does the choosing; these different roles lend themselves to different styles of flirting. Despite gender differences, however, most (but not all) of the chapters can be adapted for use by the opposite sex.\n\n\n\nAny comments on quality appreciated.\n\nObit11\n\n\n====================================================================================\nIf you need help please post in my forum, Thanks &lt;a href=&quot; http://thumperdc.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thumperdc.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t\n====================================================================================\t\t\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:942d73cad73a75f8b345a79b8ff321ced58babf7","amp;dn":"The+Machiavellian%5C%27s+Guide+to+Flirting+For+Both+Men+and+Women-Th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"942d73cad73a75f8b345a79b8ff321ced58babf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,45,115,202,215,58,117,248,179,69,167,155,143,243,33,206,213,139,171,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
