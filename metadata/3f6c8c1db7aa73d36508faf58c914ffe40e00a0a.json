At last spiritually. And musically. &quot;Plays Monk&quot; is the telling title of the CD from 1996 by EsbjÃ¶rn Svensson Trio (EST), now released on ACT. Ten of the most beloved songs by Monk, from nocturnal, lovingly caressing &quot;`Round Midnight&quot; to the gay and sprightly &quot;Rhythm-A-Ning&quot;, gets here a becomingly shining new colour.\r\n\r\nOriginally recorded in 1996, the ESBJORN SVENSSON TRIO's tribute to Thelonious Monk further establishes them as the hottest jazz act on the planet right now, as their recent UK dates have shown.&quot;Deeply lyrical, profoundly modern and beautifully balancing the tradition/innovation quotient, they have the sort of interplay that only comes from years using the same line-up (the thoughtful, unpredictable Svensson on piano plus Dan Berglund on bassand drummer Magnus Ostrom) and are currently among the most impressive of small groups in jazzâ€¦every cut is a feast of invention and beauty.&quot;\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - I Mean You\r\n02 - Criss Cross\r\n03 - 'Round Midnight\r\n04 - Bemsha Swing\r\n05 - Rhythm-A-Ning\r\n06 - In Walked Bud\r\n07 - Little Rootie Tootie\r\n08 - Eronel\r\n09 - Evidence\r\n10 - Crepscule With Nellie\r\n\r\nÂ© 2000 ACT Music / Superstudio Gul | ACT 9010-2\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nEsbjÃ¶rn Svensson - piano\r\nDan Berglund - bass\r\nMagnus Ã–strÃ¶m - drums\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Esbjorn Svensson Trio Album's....\r\n\r\n\r\nEsbjorn Svensson Trio - When Everyone Has Gone (1993) [EAC-FLAC]\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/torrent/14603031/Esbjorn_Svensson_Trio_-_When_Everyone_Has_Gone_%281993%29_[EAC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f6c8c1db7aa73d36508faf58c914ffe40e00a0a","amp;dn":"Esbjorn+Svensson+Trio+-+Plays+Monk+%281996%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f6c8c1db7aa73d36508faf58c914ffe40e00a0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,108,140,29,183,170,115,211,101,8,250,245,140,145,79,254,64,224,10,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
