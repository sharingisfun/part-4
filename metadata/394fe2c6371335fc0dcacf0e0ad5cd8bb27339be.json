Milliken and Douglas L. Milliken\nPublisher: Society of Automotive Engineers\nYear: 1995\nISBN: 9781560915263\nPages: 918\n\nWritten for the engineer as well as the race car enthusiast, Race Car Vehicle Dynamics includes much information that is not available in any other vehicle dynamics text. Truly comprehensive in its coverage of the fundamental concepts of vehicle dynamics and their application in a racing environment, this book has become the definitive reference on this topic. Although the primary focus is on the race car, the engineering fundamentals detailed are also applicable to passenger car design and engineering.\nAuthors Bill and Doug Milliken have developed many of the original vehicle dynamics theories and principles covered in this book, including the Moment Method, &quot;g-g&quot; Diagram, pair analysis, lap time simulation, and tire data normalization. The book also includes contributions from other experts in the field.\n\nChapters cover:\n*The Problem Imposed by Racing\n*Tire Behavior\n*Aerodynamic Fundamentals\n*Vehicle Axis Systems\n*and more","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:394fe2c6371335fc0dcacf0e0ad5cd8bb27339be","amp;dn":"Milliken+%26amp%3B+Milliken_Race+car+vehicle+dynamics.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"394fe2c6371335fc0dcacf0e0ad5cd8bb27339be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,79,226,198,55,19,53,252,13,202,207,14,10,213,205,139,178,115,57,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
