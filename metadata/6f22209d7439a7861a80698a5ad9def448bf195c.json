A scholar in the arcane field of semiotics, he became best known for his groundbreaking historical mystery novel THE NAME OF THE ROSE (1980), an intellectual mystery combining semiotics in fiction, biblical analysis, medieval studies and literary theory.\r\n\r\nRather than segregate his academic life from his popular fiction, Eco infused his seven novels -- all of them included in this torrent -- with many of his scholarly preoccupations.  They are full of subtle, often multilingual, references to philosophy, literature, and history, illustrating the concept of intertextuality, or the inter-connectedness, of all literary works.  He cited James Joyce and Jorge Luis Borges as the two modern authors who have influenced his work the most.\r\n\r\n\r\n==&gt; Please note this collection consists only of Eco's fiction.  I intend to upload his non-fiction and philosophical work separately within the next day or so.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following books are in ePUB format:\r\n\r\n* BAUDOLINO (Harcourt, 2002).  Translated by William Weaver.\r\n\r\n* FOUCAULT'S PENDULUM (Harcourt, 1989).  Translated by William Weaver.\r\n\r\n* THE ISLAND OF THE DAY BEFORE (Harcourt, 2005).
