Which is no surprise really, as they are joined by Nikolaj Manuel Vonsild on vocals andSimon Muschinskyon synths\n\nHaving released one album - 2009's Ten Makes A Face through EMI in their native Denmark, the four piece have now signed to Germany's !K7 to bring us Fail Forever, a sort of mini-album / EP. Short sharp and sweet, the five songs on Fail Forever are gone almost as soon as they arrive, but leave a lingering impression that will keep sending you back to the beginning to start over again.\n\nPerfectly formed pop-vignettes, the band set out as they mean to go on on the title track, bringing to mind Hercules and Love Affair's 'Blind' - soaring strings and androgynous vocals over a skipping beat. 'Pick Up Your Tears And Run' pours layers of soothing harmonies over a beat that sounds like a sub-aquatic metal forge, whereas my personal highlight 'Pinned' brings to mind Toto and Men At Work in a way that is nowhere close to the cheese-fest you may imagine. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tElectronic\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Fail Forever\n02.Pick Up Your Tears And Run\n03.Pinned\n04.You Or The Gang\n05.Greys And Blues\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e88326416e14a10cda7ca2badf6784f31ec4f599","amp;dn":"When+Saints+Go+Machine+-+Fail+Forever+EP+%282011%29+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e88326416e14a10cda7ca2badf6784f31ec4f599","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,131,38,65,110,20,161,12,218,124,162,186,223,103,132,243,30,196,245,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
