Celestine quickly learns that M. Rabour is a more or less harmless boot fetishist, his daughter a frigid woman more concerned with the family furnishings than in returning the affections of her husband, who, in turn, can't keep his hands off the servants. The gamekeeper, Joseph (Georges Geret), is a fascist who keeps his masters informed of all the doings downstairs, and the next-door neighbor (Daniel Ivernel) is a veteran who can't stand Monteil and is sharing a bed with his housekeeper. Celestine picks her way through this minefield carefully, spurning the advances of all of the men until it's convenient for her. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058249/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058249/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary_of_a_Chambermaid_%281964_film%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary_of_a_Chambermaid_%281964_film%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nSubtitles\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-58249/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-58249/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDirector:\nLuis BuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±uel\n\n\n\n\tJeanne Moreau\t ... \tCÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©stine\n\tGeorges GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ret\t... \tJoseph\n\tDaniel Ivernel\t... \tCaptain Mauger\n\tFranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§oise Lugagne\t... \tMadame Monteil\n\tMuni\t... \tMarianne\n\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:38:07\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 608x256 2.38:1\nCodec : DivX 5\nFPS : 29,97\nBitRate : 1212 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,27 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:315bc978d731d52fe10cb5a9664be62409db02f7","amp;dn":"Le+Journal+D%5C%27une+Femme+De+Chambre+%281964%29++Jeanne+Moreau+FR+%28Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"315bc978d731d52fe10cb5a9664be62409db02f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,91,201,120,215,49,213,47,225,12,181,169,102,75,230,36,9,219,2,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
