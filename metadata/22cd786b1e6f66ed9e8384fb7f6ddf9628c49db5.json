Trouble soon         \n          rears its ugly head when it transpires              \n           that her parents, who have been in a long             \n             term witness protection programme, have             \n            been found by the criminals they put behind         \n           bars. Robert Matthew Van Winkle, aka Vanilla      \n              Ice, burst on to the nation's conscience           \n                in the early nineties with his massive hit    \n                ICE ICE BABY, famously sampling Queen and     \n                David Bowie's UNDER PRESSURE. It was the      \n                first single by a rapper to hit number one    \n                in the US making him an international mega    \n                star. His 1991 film debut sees him on top     \n                form and features cameos from Naomi Campbell  \n                and Bobbie Brown.                             \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                   \n                             \n                                      \n                            -+ Rip Notes +-                      \n                                                              \n                                                                  \n                  When at all possible we like to bring      \n                you the DVDs of films that we've previously  \n                released under other sources and Cool As Ice \n                is no exception. We thought this day might   \n                never come and although we'd still really    \n                love a Blu-Ray copy we'll gladly take this    \n                in the mean time. Finally, in glorious        \n                widescreen, this amazing convergence of      \n                post-80s and early 90s fashion, language     \n                and style gets the treatment it has always   \n                deserved. If you've never seen this movie,   \n                now is the time! Cool as Ice catches the     \n                zeitgeist of the unreal period in which      \n                Vanilla Ice became the biggest rap star in   \n                the world. Despite Vanilla's own short-      \n                lived success this film has managed to       \n           stand the test of time and is truly                \n            deserving of its cult status.                        \n                                                                    \n                Lastly we'd just like to thank a friend            \n             who helped make this happen. It's people            \n          like him that keep this fun. Thanks again,          \n          and thanks to all our friends who keep it             \n             interesting.

A time of classic kids flicks,                \n          painstaking hand-drawn animation and countless             \n             cheesy low-budget horrors. A time when pop had             \n              a King, and rock had a Queen. A time when special\n              FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of their\n              many tools.\n\n                Driven by nostalgia and memories of better\n              days, we seek to relive those times, and share\n              those memories. While our belief is that the\n              80s represent the very pinnacle of pop culture,\n              we will not limit ourselves to one decade, or\n              any single genre. We will not ignore the movies\n              considered insignificant or even embarrassing by\n              the studios. We will not disregard a timepiece\n              just because it is dated.\n\n                Whereas most groups rely solely on digital\n              sources, there are still thousands of rare and\n              out of print titles, many of which have no\n              planned digital release. We've made it our\n              mission to dig these out, clean them up using\n              the best hardware and techniques available to\n              us, and share them with the world. Be it VHS,\n              Laserdisc or more exotic formats, we're here\n              to bring you the best (and worst!) of decades\n           past. So sit back and enjoy as we uncover and             \n           pay tribute to an age of cinema we will never           \n         get back.                                               \n                                                                     \n                                                               \n                                                     \n                                     \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                           -+  Respect  +-                  \n                                                            \n                                                                \n                  AEN  AEROHOLiCS  ALLiANCE  ARTHOUSE           \n                                                                \n                 BLooDLiTE  BLooDWeiSeR  EPiSODE  FiCO          \n                                                                \n               FLS  FRAGMENT  HkM  HUMANiSM  KYR  MEMETiC       \n                                                                 \n              QiX  SAPHiRE  TheWretched  VH-PROD  VoMiT  xV      \n                                                                 \n                                                                 \n                 Gone But Not Forgotten         \n                                                                 \n                  SiCK  Cheetah-TV  CuNT  TCF  SChiZO            \n                                                                 \n                                                                 \n                   and everyone who truly contributes            \n                                                                 \n                                                              \n       \n                                             \n                  ascii: asphyx!LGF!CPH!SAC!ACiD 2002","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22cd786b1e6f66ed9e8384fb7f6ddf9628c49db5","amp;dn":"Cool.As.Ice.1991.DVDRip.XviD-FLAiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22cd786b1e6f66ed9e8384fb7f6ddf9628c49db5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,205,120,107,30,111,102,237,158,131,132,251,127,109,223,150,40,196,157,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
