Jackson (Pulp Fiction) rocks this mock bedtime story, capturing a hilarious range of emotions as the voice of a father struggling to get his child to sleep. Go the Fuck to Sleep is a bedtime book for parents who live in the real world, where a few snoozing kitties and cutesy rhymes don't always send a toddler sailing blissfully off to dreamland. California Book Award-winning author Adam Mansbach's profane, affectionate, and radically honest verses perfectly capture the familiar - and unspoken - tribulations of putting your little angel down for the night. In the process, he opens up a conversation about parenting, granting us permission to admit our frustrations and laugh at their absurdity. Beautiful, subversive, and pants-wettingly funny, Go the Fuck to Sleep is a book for parents new, old, and expectant. Due to its explicit language, you probably should not play it for your children.\nUnabridged.\nRead By Samuel L. Jackson\n\n\n-----------------------------------\nVisit us for this and more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws\n\n-----------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80fb2916160bec0e9b16464aeda65972f7b516fb","amp;dn":"Go+The+Fuck+To+Sleep+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+Adam+Mansbach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80fb2916160bec0e9b16464aeda65972f7b516fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,251,41,22,22,11,236,14,155,22,70,74,237,166,89,114,247,181,22,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
