Modern imaging technologies\nallow the depiction of internal\norgan systems in a multitude of ways,\nmaking thorough knowledge of the anatomy\nof organ systems more crucial than ever\nfor physicians and other healthcare practitioners.\nCurrent medical training needs to\nacknowledge and stay abreast of these\nchanges. In addition, new teaching methods\nin medicine, especially integrated and interactive\nforms of teaching, require a combination\nof interdisciplinary thinking and systematic\nstructure. It was our aim in refining\nthis atlas to take all of these factors into consideration\nwhile still maintaining its concise\nformat. Each individual organ is presented\nin a brief overview, followed by a systematic\ndiscussion of its gross and microscopic anatomic\nfeatures. This is followed by descriptions\nof functional aspects, neurovascular\nsupply, and lymphatic drainage. Organspecific\ntopographical features are then\npresented as well as useful tips for the clinician;\nrelevant cross-sectional anatomy is\ndescribed when, in addition to organ systems,\nknowledge of general regional topography\nshould be known.\nA new chapter, &quot;Pregnancy and Human\nDevelopment,&quot; has been added to the present\nbook, now in its fifth edition. This chapter\nintegrates knowledge of anatomy, histology,\nembryology, gynecology, obstetrics,\nand pediatrics, without losing sight of morphology.\nNot only was it readily incorporated\ninto the fifth edition, it also supports\nmodern interdisciplinary teaching\nmethods of today's curricula. This chapter\nwas written with the help of Dr. K. Hauser\n(editing), K.Wesker (graphics), and K. Baum\n(graphic design). We are indebted to them\nas well as to those who assisted with the\nprevious two editions, all of whom understood\nperfectly how to carry on the work of\nthe &quot;old crew,&quot; especially Dr. P. Kundmiiller\nand Professor G. Spitzer, and how to integrate\na newly written chapter by the coauthors\ninto existing text. We would especially\nlike to thank Professor A. Bergant,\nClinic for Gynecology and Obstetrics in\nlnnsbruck for permission to use the images\nfrom pregnancy ultrasounds. Not least we\nwould like to thank the secretary at the Institute\nof Anatomy at the University of\nLiibeck, R.Jiinsson, for preparing portions of\nthe manuscript and providing a clean copy.\nWe hope that the revised and expanded\nfifth edition will also be well received by\nmedical and dental students and that it will\nmake the challenging field of anatomy of\ninternal organs more accessible.\n\nCopyright to the respective owners.If you like this book then please buy it.\nSharing is caring,Seed this torrent so others could enjoy it too.\nAny requests/suggestions can be made in the comments section or via email to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;86ebf3eee7ebebe7e2a8f1e7f7e7f4a8e7e4e4e7f5c6eaeff0e3a8e5e9eb&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nThanks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c293d935f8b3b30e24afaf9fadbb8b4409beb182","amp;dn":"Color+Atlas+of+Human+Anatomy+Vol+2+%5BH.Fritsch%2CW.Kuehnel%5D.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c293d935f8b3b30e24afaf9fadbb8b4409beb182","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,147,217,53,248,179,179,14,36,175,175,159,173,187,139,68,9,190,177,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
