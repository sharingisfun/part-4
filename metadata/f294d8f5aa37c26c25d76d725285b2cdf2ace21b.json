Louis joins dog catchers from the city's biggest pound as they enter some of the roughest districts to capture or seize dogs. Thousands are euthanized in LA each year, while others are put up for rescue or adoption. In some of LA's more affluent neighbourhoods, Louis meets the dog-lovers and trainers trying to rehabilitate troubled dogs, while back in south LA we also meet a former gang member who helps turn dogs into weapons.\n\n2)  Edge of Life \nLouis heads to West Hollywood's Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to experience the American way of death. A huge amount of money is spent on treatment during the last year of life and Louis follows the stories of three patients as they grapple with their seemingly terminal conditions. Should they accept the odds are against them and try and pass away in as comfortable a way as possible? Or should they go down fighting, trying every last treatment no matter how unlikely it is to succeed or how bad the side effects may be? In America - a country that leads the world in spending on end-of-life care - it is often the latter. With extraordinary access to families and patients in deep crisis, Louis will ask difficult questions about health care for terminal patients in the US.\n\n3)  Among the Sex Offenders \nIn the final episode Louis looks at how California deals with sex offenders after release from prison. Under strict parole conditions, they are tagged with GPS devices and kept under constant watch. Under Megan's Law, they are placed on a register for life, and anyone can find out their identity and learn about their past crimes, while under Jessica's Law, they cannot live near parks or schools and many are separated from their families. Louis enters the twilight world of hostels and homelessness and talks with extraordinary openness to convicted sex offenders and those charged with monitoring them to ask questions about the purpose and effects of these laws.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/6864/gci0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/6864/gci0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/8703/6spv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/8703/6spv.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/2136/8vto.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/2136/8vto.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/6411/rv83.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/6411/rv83.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img716.imageshack.us/img716/5363/d67h.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img716.imageshack.us/img716/5363/d67h.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/674/wjj4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/674/wjj4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/3483/1dq9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/3483/1dq9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/3748/bxrh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/3748/bxrh.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img580.imageshack.us/img580/8963/lkr0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img580.imageshack.us/img580/8963/lkr0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/2618/i68f.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/2618/i68f.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/3530/zred.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/3530/zred.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img27.imageshack.us/img27/7665/ajm9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img27.imageshack.us/img27/7665/ajm9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5f173638371f136b716e&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 19\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.42 VBR 48KHz (~132Kbps)\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: 59mins\n * Number of Parts: 3\n * Part Size: 1.32 GB (average)\n * Source: HDTV\n\nEncoded by: JungleBoy\n\nRelease Notes\nMerged subtitles\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03zjc67&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03zjc67&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f294d8f5aa37c26c25d76d725285b2cdf2ace21b","amp;dn":"BBC+Louis+Therouxs+LA+Stories+1of3+City+of+Dogs+720p+x264+AAC+HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f294d8f5aa37c26c25d76d725285b2cdf2ace21b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,148,216,245,170,55,194,108,37,215,109,114,82,133,178,205,242,172,226,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
