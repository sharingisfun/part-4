Salvatore (Jul 5, 2011)\n\nDrizzt joins Bruenor on his quest for the fabled dwarven kingdom of Gauntlgrym: ruins said to be rich with ancient treasure and arcane lore. But before they even get close, another drow and dwarf pair stumbles across it first: Jarlaxle and Athrogate. In their search for treasure and magic, Jarlaxle and Athrogate inadvertently set into motion a catastrophe that could spell disaster for the unsuspecting people of the city of NeverwinterÃ¢â‚¬â€a catastrophe big enough to lure even the mercenary Jarlaxle into risking his own coin and skin to stop it. Unfortunately, the more they uncover about the secret of Gauntlgrym, the more it looks like they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop it on their own. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need help, and from the last people they ever thought to fight alongside again: Drizzt and Bruenor.\n\nBook 2 - Neverwinter {Legend of Drizzt} (Neverwinter Saga) by R.A. Salvatore (Jul 3, 2012) \n\nWith the last of his trusted companions having fallen, Drizzt is alone--and free--for the first time in almost a hundred years. Guilt mingles with relief, leaving Drizzt uniquely vulnerable to the persuasions of his newest companion--Dahlia, a darkly alluring elf and the only other member of their party to survive the cataclysm at Mount Hotenow. But traveling with Dahlia is challenging in more ways than one. As the two companions seek revenge on the one responsible for leveling Neverwinter--and nearly Luskan as well--Drizzt finds his usual moral certainty swept away by her unconventional views. Forced to see the dark deeds that the common man may be driven to by circumstance, Drizzt begins to find himself on the wrong side of the law in an effort to protect those the law has failed. Making new enemies, as his old enemies acquire deadly allies, Drizzt and Dahlia quickly find themselves embroiled in battle--a state he's coming to enjoy a little too much.\n\nBook 3 - Charon's Claw (Neverwinter Saga) by R.A. Salvatore (Aug 7, 2012)\n\nIn the 3rd book of the #4 New York Times best-selling Neverwinter Saga, Drizzt draws his swords once more to aid his friends. His lover, Dahlia SinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢felle, can speak of nothing but the moment she will face the Netherese lord Herzgo Alegni once again. Drizzt has already followed a trail of vengeance beside Dahlia. Can he justify one more battle to settle a grudge he does not understand? Artemis Entreri too seeks vengeance. He offers to aid Dahlia in her mission to destroy Alegni. But CharonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Claw, AlegniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sentient sword, dominates EntreriÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s movementsÃ¢â‚¬â€if not his mind. And then thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the way Entreri looks at Dahlia. Can Drizzt trust his old foe?\n\nBook 4 - The Last Threshold (Neverwinter Saga) by R. A. Salvatore (Mar 5, 2013) \n\nIn the final book of the #4 New York Times best-selling Neverwinter Saga, Drizzt DoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Urden navigates a winding path littered with secrets and lies. Tangled up in his companion DahliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dark secrets, the ties that once held her close to Drizzt threaten to tear as her bonds to his former foe, Artemis Entreri, continue to grow. Meanwhile, in the caverns of Gauntlgrym, the drow Tiago Baenre enlists the help of Bregan DÃ¢â‚¬â„¢aerthe in his quest to destroy Drizzt. While making promises they may not keep, the agents of the elite drow mercenary group hide plans of their own. Determined to stand for whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right in the Realms once again, Drizzt forges a new road northÃ¢â‚¬â€toward Icewind Dale. Will his new companions follow? Can he fight the darkness alone? Either way, he knows now where heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s headedÃ¢â‚¬â€back to the only place thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever felt like home. \n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38b86802a683a5182877e3a7917246bff7c569fd","amp;dn":"Neverwinter+Saga+%28Books+1-4%29+by+R.+A.+Salvatore+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38b86802a683a5182877e3a7917246bff7c569fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,184,104,2,166,131,165,24,40,119,227,167,145,114,70,191,247,197,105,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
