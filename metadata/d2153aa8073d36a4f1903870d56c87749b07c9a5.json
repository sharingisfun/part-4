Your dog will focus its attention on you. Your dog either obeys your commands or suffers the consequences of its actions. This is NOT punishment. Your dog obeys because it wants to please you. By setting clear limits, you also help your dog to feel secure because it knows its actions are right. A well-behaved dog is not only a joy to his owners, but is also a happy dog.\n\n- What You Can Expect with the Koehler Method\n\nSay GOODBYE to having your shoelaces chewed to bits, tense confrontations involving other dogs and messy scavenges whenever you walk your dog past by trash bins. With the Koehler method, you can increase your dogÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s confidence and strengthen the bond between your dog and you. Once your dog has been trained, you can be assured that your dog will heel, sit, stay, halt and stand at your command 100% of the time, whether or not there are distractions around. I have not witnessed any other dog training method that is half as effective as the Koehler method.\n\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a myriad of training methods out there, but only the Koehler method provides consistent results for a lifetime. The training phase is a valuable investment as it could save your dogÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life one day. The Koehler method is outstanding in that you systematically train your dog WITHOUT your dog perceiving any ambiguity, WITHOUT nagging and WITHOUT the need for treats!\n\n\n\n*The Koehler Method of dog training is just as valid and useful in the 21st century as it was in the 20th century and we believe it will continue to have just as much meaning for as long as we have dogs to train.*\n\nTable of Content\n\n.Bill Koehler, The Man &amp; His Method  (page 6)\n.The Bill Koehler I Know (page 12)\n.A Real Life Experience (page 19)\n.Care &amp; Housing (page 22)\n.Lesson 1: Fables and Foibles (page 24)\n.Lesson 2: Correct Equipment (page 25)\n.Lesson 3: The Foundation (page 28)\n.Lesson 4: Heeling (page 36)\n.Lesson 5: Sitting (page 44)\n.Lesson 6: The Automatic Sit (page 48)\n.Lesson 7: The Sit-Stay (page 49)\n.Lesson 8: Stand For Examination (page 54)\n.Lesson 9: The Down (page 60)\n.Lesson 10: Down-Stay (page 66)\n.Lesson 11: Recall (page 69)\n.Lesson 12: Finish (page 72)\n.Lesson 13: Polishing (page 77)\n.Lesson 14: The Throw Chain (page 80)\n.Lesson 15: The Light Line (page 86)\n.Lesson 16: DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Lose it Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Use it (page 92)\n.Problems (page 97)\n.Be  a Koehler Trainer (page 105)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2153aa8073d36a4f1903870d56c87749b07c9a5","amp;dn":"Koehler+method+of+dog+training+made+simple","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2153aa8073d36a4f1903870d56c87749b07c9a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,21,58,168,7,61,54,164,241,144,56,112,213,108,135,116,155,7,201,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
