This is far more interesting than that: a countdown show ranking the diets of 50 countries.\nThe Mediterranean diet gets high scores, but it won't come as any surprise that other results are more intriguing. Who would have thought the Ethiopians could teach us a thing or two? Or that we should be devouring fermented cabbage daily like the South Koreans?\nFood Unwrapped presenters Jimmy Doherty and Kate Quilton travel the globe examining the eating habits of a variety of countries, tribes and communities, revealing how dietary tendencies have changed radically since the 1960s. Experts help them rank 50 of the world's diets, from worst to best, as they explore the differences and surprising similarities between what people, thousands of miles apart, consume. Will their discoveries offer an insight into how individuals can improve their health and quality of life?\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;561e3f313e161a627867&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 3168 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/sVBR 48 KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 74mins\n * Framerate: 25 fps\n * Number of Parts: 1\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: 1.62 GB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45439f11bdfef63e041c88fc19ef37d2fac8c6ad","amp;dn":"The.Worlds.Best.Diet.720p.HDTV.x264.AAC.MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45439f11bdfef63e041c88fc19ef37d2fac8c6ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,67,159,17,189,254,246,62,4,28,136,252,25,239,55,210,250,200,198,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
