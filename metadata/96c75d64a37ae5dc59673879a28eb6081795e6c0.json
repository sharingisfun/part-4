The programmability of modern GPUs allows developers to not only distinguish themselves from one another but also to use this awesome processing power for non-graphics applications, such as physics simulation, financial analysis, and even virus detectionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½particularly with the CUDA architecture. Graphics remains the leading application for GPUs, and readers will find that the latest algorithms create ultra-realistic characters, better lighting, and post-rendering compositing effects.\n\nMajor topics include\n\nGeometry\nLight and Shadows\nRendering\nImage Effects\nPhysics Simulation\nGPU Computing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96c75d64a37ae5dc59673879a28eb6081795e6c0","amp;dn":"GPU+Gems+3+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96c75d64a37ae5dc59673879a28eb6081795e6c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,199,93,100,163,122,229,220,89,103,56,121,162,142,182,8,23,149,230,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
