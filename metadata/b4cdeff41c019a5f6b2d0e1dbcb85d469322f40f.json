Which then can be useful to install OS X on an x86 Intel SSE2 and better PC, using for example the BOOT-132 method. Be aware that by booting this DVD into your PC, you will not be able to install Mac OS X! For that, you can read the full instructions here: http://forum.insanelymac.com/index.php?showtopic=113288\n\nThis image upload is not intended for MAC users wishing to burn to DVD with Mac utilities such as Disk Utility, Toast, etc., since this is a .ISO and not a .dmg or .toast image. (However MAC users should also be able to burn it to DVD, if interested anyways.)\n\nRemember to share what you will enjoy with others to enjoy as well! [SEED]\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\nSUPERMarioSUNShine\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4cdeff41c019a5f6b2d0e1dbcb85d469322f40f","amp;dn":"Mac.OS.X.Retail.DVD.ISO.%28Leopard.10.5.1%29.%5BFOR.WINDOWS.BURN%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4cdeff41c019a5f6b2d0e1dbcb85d469322f40f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,205,239,244,28,1,154,95,107,45,14,29,188,184,93,70,147,34,244,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
