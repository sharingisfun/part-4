They offer a glimpse into private pages where artists brainstorm, doodle, develop and work on ideas, and keep track of their musings. \nArtists use these journals to document their daily lives, produce their initial ideas for bigger projects, and practice their skills. Using a variety of media from paint to pencil to collage, these pages can become works of art themselves. \nThey often feel fresh and alive because they are first thoughts and often not reworked. These pages capture the artist's personalities along with glimpses of their process of working and inspirations.\n\nSee inside the sketchbooks of artists Jessica Hische, Mike Perry, Jen Corace, Matt Leines, Jill Bliss, Camilla Engman, Anders Nilsen and many more.\n\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;\n\nvisit me on facebook -  Google &quot;TEAM NANBAN TPB&quot;\n                                         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/fb0d/1d6489436.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/fb0d/1d6489436.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTO JOIN TMRG ON FACEBOOK\nTMRG IS TORRENT MAFIA RELEASE GROUP\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a21775fa15f5be166038fb0d6c383d11049dbdf4","amp;dn":"Drawn+In-Inspiring+Sketchbooks+of+44+Fine+Artists%2C+Illustrators%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a21775fa15f5be166038fb0d6c383d11049dbdf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,23,117,250,21,245,190,22,96,56,251,13,108,56,61,17,4,157,189,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
