Not moving my head, I direct my eyes to a point halfway up the archway where Kim Jong-ilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s face will soon appear.\n\nAs North Korea's State Poet Laureate, Jang Jin-sung led a charmed life. With food provisions (even as the country suffered through its great famine), a travel pass, access to strictly censored information, and audiences with Kim Jong-il himself, his life in Pyongyang seemed safe and secure. But this privileged existence was about to be shattered. When a strictly forbidden magazine he lent to a friend goes missing, Jang Jin-sung must flee for his life.\n\nNever before has a member of the elite described the inner workings of this totalitarian state and its propaganda machine. An astonishing exposÃƒÂ© told through the heart-stopping story of Jang Jin-sung's escape to South Korea, Dear Leader is a rare and unprecedented insight into the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most secretive and repressive regime.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a22c1cc5febadd37a7e0f7d5cb82c4036cebdc4","amp;dn":"Dear+Leader+%28A+Look+inside+North+Korea%29+Jang+Jin-sung+Audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a22c1cc5febadd37a7e0f7d5cb82c4036cebdc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,34,193,204,95,235,173,211,122,126,15,125,92,184,44,64,54,206,189,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
