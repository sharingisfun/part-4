Records celebrate Van MorrisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic 1970 album in 1-CD, 2-CD and 4-CD/1-BD configurations. The latter expanded versions comprehensively explore the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sessions via outtakes, alternate takes and previously unheard mixes.\nFollowing one 1967 album for Bert BernsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Bang Records, Van Morrison made his debut at the famous Burbank label in 1968 with Astral Weeks.\nIt was a creation like no other, and not even MorrisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most ardent fan at the time could have predicted its heady blend of rock, jazz, folk and classical styles into one opus juxtaposing the spiritual and the earthbound. But the Irish troubadour couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stay in one musical bagfor too long a period of time. 1970Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Moondance was every bit as light as Astral Weeks was dark, and every bit as accessible as Astral Weeks was esoteric.\n\nIn the years since its release, the soulful, jazzy title track of Moondance has become a modern standard, recorded by artists including Michael BublÃƒÂ© and Nancy Wilson and even featuring as the curtain call to Susan StromanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tony Award-winning dance musical Contact.  Strangely, Ã¢â‚¬Å“MoondanceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t released as a single until 1977 (!) when it barely eked into the Hot 100, but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hardly deterred its consistent radio airplay and frequent use in films and television.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Come Running,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the original selection for a single, did manage to crack the Top 40 while the album itself notched a respectable No. 39 chart placement.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Crazy LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has also received its share of cover versions over the years while Ã¢â‚¬Å“Into the MysticÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ could be MorrisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ultimate statement.  His ode to the power of radio, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Caravan,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is no less powerful, while album opener Ã¢â‚¬Å“And It Stoned MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a fan favorite to this day.\n\nThese newly-remastered editions mark the first major domestic reissues of Moondance.   A 2008 Japanese edition boasted of first-ever remastering for the title, though it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t made available elsewhere.   Moondance will be available as a single remastered disc for those simply desiring a sonically upgraded version of the original album, and as a 2-CD set with a second disc containing eleven additional tracks drawn from across the box setÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s three bonus discs.  (A mono mix of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Crazy LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is listed among the 2-CD editionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tracks, and the box setÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lone Ã¢â‚¬Å“Crazy LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ remix isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t specified as mono or stereo.  We hope to find out whether the mono track is exclusive to the 2-CD version.)   A 4-CD/1-BD version will add three full discs of bonus tracks to the original album as well as a Blu-ray Audio disc with the original album in 48/24 PCM stereo and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround sound mixed by Grammy-winning surround guru Elliot Scheiner.\n\nMoondance 4-CD/1-BD Box Set (Warner Bros.
