The series is usually categorized as a situation comedy, though it is sometimes also described as a &quot;dark comedy&quot; or a &quot;dramedy&quot; because of the dramatic subject material often presented.[7] The show was an ensemble piece revolving around key personnel in a United States Army Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH; the asterisks in the name are not part of military nomenclature and were creatively introduced in the novel) in the Korean War (1950Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1953).\n\nThe &quot;4077th MASH&quot; was one of several surgical units in Korea. As the show developed, the writing took on more of a moralistic tone. Richard Hooker, who wrote the book on which the television and film versions were based, noted that Hawkeye's character was far more liberal in the show than on the page (in one of the MASH books, Hawkeye makes reference to &quot;kicking the bejesus out of lefties just to stay in shape&quot;). \n\nWhile the show is traditionally viewed as a comedy, there were many episodes of a more serious tone. Airing on network prime-time while the Vietnam War was still ongoing, the show was forced to walk the fine line of commenting on that war while at the same time not seeming to protest against it. For this reason, the show's discourse, under the cover of comedy, often questioned, mocked and grappled with America's role in the Cold War. \n\nEpisodes were both plot and character driven, with several episodes being narrated by one of the show's characters as the contents of a letter home. The show's tone could move from silly to sobering from one episode to the next, with dramatic tension often occurring between the civilian draftees of 4077thÃ¢â‚¬â€Hawkeye, Trapper John, B.J. Hunnicutt, for exampleÃ¢â‚¬â€who are forced to leave their homes to tend to the wounded and dying of the war, and the &quot;regular Army&quot; characters, like Margaret Houlihan and Colonel Potter, who tend to represent ideas of patriotism and duty (though Houlihan and Potter could represent the other perspective at times as well). \n\nOther characters like Col. Blake, Maj. Winchester, and Corp. Klinger, help demonstrate various American civilian attitudes toward army life, while guest characters played by such actors as Eldon Quick, Herb Voland, Mary Wickes, and Tim O'Connor also help further the show's discussion of America's place as Cold War war-maker and peacemaker.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ad96ca8eb8dfdfbeaf6ebd208d315a2a9e868e4","amp;dn":"MASH+Seasons+1-11+%28no+laugh+track%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ad96ca8eb8dfdfbeaf6ebd208d315a2a9e868e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,217,108,168,235,141,253,251,234,246,235,210,8,211,21,162,169,232,104,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
