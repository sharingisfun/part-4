On this recording, Jones doesn't mess with her trademark formula. Under Arif Mardin's cozy coproduction, Jones is supported by her writing partners, her Handsome Band, and some special guests (country legend Dolly Parton, Levon Helm and Garth Hudson of the Band, and jazz drummer Brian Blade, to name a few). Jones's Texas-twanged vocals and her sparse acoustic and electric Wurlitzer piano lines enliven the CD's 13 tracks, from the light and lively single &quot;Sunrise&quot; to Tom Waits's &quot;The Long Way Home&quot; and the bouncy duet with Parton, &quot;Creepin' In.&quot; Jones's soul-baring piano/vocal rendition of Duke Ellington's &quot;Melancholia,&quot; retitled &quot;Don't Miss You at All,&quot; proves she's a true Blue Note artist with unlimited potential.\n\nWikipedia - Feels Like Home is the second album by jazz songwriter Norah Jones, released in 2004.
