With this book,\nyouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to create code thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beautiful, safe, and simple to understand and test by\nusing JavaScriptÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s functional programming support. Author Michael Fogus shows you how to apply\nfunctional-style concepts with Underscore.js, a JavaScript library that facilitates functional\nprogramming techniques. Sample code is available on GitHub at\n{ https://github.com/funjs/book-source }......\n\n\nFogus helps you think in a functional way to help you minimize complexity in the programs you\nbuild. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a JavaScript programmer hoping to learn functional programming techniques, or\na functional programmer looking to learn JavaScript, this book is the ideal introduction.\n\n* Use applicative programming techniques with first-class functions\n* Understand how and why you might leverage variable scoping and closures\n* Delve into higher-order functionsÃ¢â‚¬â€and learn how they take other functions as arguments for\n  maximum advantage\n* Explore ways to compose new functions from existing functions\n* Get around JavaScriptÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s limitations for using recursive functions\n* Reduce, hide, or eliminate the footprint of state change in your programs\n* Practice flow-based programming with chains and functional pipelines\n* Discover how to code without using classes\n\nEnjoy.\nPlease Seed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cdea1ca50b3ff192e9b528d7f9fc019aedd05d3","amp;dn":"O%27REILLY+-+Functional+JavaScript+%5BJune+2013%5D+%5Bmasum2444%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cdea1ca50b3ff192e9b528d7f9fc019aedd05d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,222,161,202,80,179,255,25,46,155,82,141,127,159,192,25,174,221,5,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
