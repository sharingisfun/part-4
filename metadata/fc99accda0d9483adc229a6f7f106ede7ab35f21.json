Some understanding of image data (for example, pixels and color channels) would be beneficial. At a minimum you will need access to at least one webcam. Certain exercises require additional hardware like a second webcam, a Microsoft Kinect or an OpenNI-compliant depth sensor such as the Asus Xtion PRO\n================\n\nDovah","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc99accda0d9483adc229a6f7f106ede7ab35f21","amp;dn":"Joseph+Howse%2C+OpenCV+Computer+Vision+with+Python+epub+%5Bdovah%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc99accda0d9483adc229a6f7f106ede7ab35f21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,153,172,205,160,217,72,58,220,34,154,111,127,16,110,222,122,179,95,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
