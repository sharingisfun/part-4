This collection offers 52 pieces of hilarity, deadpan weirdness and outlandish ideas. Do you want to hear about the time Hitler went for a haircut? Or why Woody reveres Socrates? Have you ever wondered what would have happened if the Impressionists had actually been dentists? You can learn much about history - the piece on the invention of sandwiches is eye-opening - or modern life in this selection of thoughts, observations, diaries and stories from one of the most original minds and wonderfully comic voices of our time.\n\nPublisher: Wings Books; 1st edition (March 29, 1992)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0517072297\nISBN-13: 978-0517072295","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75de937abd9b1e491ab342dc77686875f8173630","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Prose+of+Woody+Allen%28pdf%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75de937abd9b1e491ab342dc77686875f8173630","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,222,147,122,189,155,30,73,26,179,66,220,119,104,104,117,248,23,54,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
