Dr. Bruce Lipton is a former medical school professor and research scientist. His experiments, and that of other leading-edge scientists, have examined in great detail the processes by which cells receive information. The implications of this research radically change our understanding of life. It shows that genes and DNA do not control our biology; that instead DNA is controlled by signals from outside the cell, including the energetic messages emanating from our positive and negative thoughts.\n\n\nThanks for seeding and sharing!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfb2a4060d9e3888f676946b7dbd15718219e7f8","amp;dn":"Bruce.Lipton.-.The.Biology.of.Belief.DVDrip.%5BENG.ITA.GER%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfb2a4060d9e3888f676946b7dbd15718219e7f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,178,164,6,13,158,56,136,246,118,148,107,125,189,21,113,130,25,231,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
