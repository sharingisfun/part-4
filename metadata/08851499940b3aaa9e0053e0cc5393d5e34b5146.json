Including authors such as Clifford Simak, Harry Harrison, Bruce Sterling, A. E. Van Vogt and Brian Aldiss himself, these stories portray struggles against machines, epic journeys, genetic experiments, time travellers and alien races. From stories set on Earth, to uncanny far distant worlds and ancient burned-out suns, the one constant is humanity itself, compelled by an often fatal curiosity to explore the boundless frontiers of time, space and probability.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08851499940b3aaa9e0053e0cc5393d5e34b5146","amp;dn":"A+Science+Fiction+Omnibus+-+Aldiss+Brian.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08851499940b3aaa9e0053e0cc5393d5e34b5146","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,133,20,153,148,11,58,170,158,0,83,224,204,83,147,213,227,75,81,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
