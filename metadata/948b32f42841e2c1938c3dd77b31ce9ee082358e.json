It also lets you quickly communicate ideas that may be difficult to put into words. To help you hone your skills, Von Glitschka has developed the 21-Day Drawing Challenge. The goal isn't to turn you into a professional illustrator or fine artist.it's about improving your drawing skills and creative thinking, no matter if you're an expert or have never drawn more than a doodle on a notepad.\n\nVon will assign you a drawing challenge for each day. Take the time you need to finish each challenge, and then watch the video where Von shares his own hand-drawn solution. There are no right answers here; his solutions should serve as inspiration! For more encouragement, look no further than the chapter on inspiring drawers. Each movie profiles a different artist, including people like Kate Bingaman Burt and Mattias Adolfsson. So, step up to the plate. You're just 21 days from a new creative habit.\n\n\nTopics include:\n\n1.Introduction\n\n2.Drawing Conclusions\n\n3.Drawing Challenges\n\n4.Keep Drawing\n\n5.Inspiring Drawers\n\n6.Conclusion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:948b32f42841e2c1938c3dd77b31ce9ee082358e","amp;dn":"%5BLynda%5D+21+Day+Drawing+Challenge+COMPLETE+Tutorial-KTR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"948b32f42841e2c1938c3dd77b31ce9ee082358e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,139,50,244,40,65,226,193,147,140,61,215,123,49,206,158,224,130,53,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
