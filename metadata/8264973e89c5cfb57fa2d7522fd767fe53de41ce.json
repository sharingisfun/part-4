As Ray's uniquely English songwriting style developed, the spectre of Ray and\r\nDave's rocky fraternal relationship continually loomed in the background, through\r\nconcerts for the Old Grey Whistle Test in the 1970s to appearances on Top of the Pops\r\nin the 1980s.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable band split came in 1996, and the BBC archive continues with Ray's reinvention\r\nas a solo artist with performances on the Electric Proms and up to the present day on Later\r\nwith Jools Holland. All the while the brothers continue to tease and goad the press - and\r\none another - with talk of a Kinks reunion.\r\n\r\nSCREENS\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/20767832787730432379.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/95301781949355532571.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/85558543311851402437.png\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMAT:.......................: MP4\r\nFULLSIZE:.....................: 756 MiB\r\nRESOLUTION:...................: 720*404=16:9\r\nFRAME RATE:...................: 25.000 fps\r\nAUDIO AAC:....................: 256 Kbps [stereo]\r\nCHANNELS:.....................: 2 Front: L/R\r\nLANGUAGE:.....................: English\r\nVIDEO BITRATE:................: 1500 Kbps\r\nSUBTITLES:....................: NONE\r\nRUNTIME:......................: 59mn 54s\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8264973e89c5cfb57fa2d7522fd767fe53de41ce","amp;dn":"BBC+%3D+The+Kinks+at+the+BBC+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8264973e89c5cfb57fa2d7522fd767fe53de41ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,100,151,62,137,197,207,181,127,162,215,82,47,215,103,254,83,222,65,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
