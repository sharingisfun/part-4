Upstairs, Downstairs\nMichael Cockerell explores the upstairs-downstairs world of the House of Commons. We see what goes on backstage at the state opening, when the Queen comes to open the parliamentary year, including a surreal traditional search for gunpowder. Behind the pomp and pageantry, we meet the army of skilled workers who struggle to keep the Commons show on the road. We follow MPs who want to introduce their own bills in the Commons and have to play a bizarre form of parliamentary bingo to get the chance. And we show how Labour and Conservative MPs conspire together to thwart their party whips. In this episode we meet two very different MPs: Robert Halfon, a campaigning Conservative and thorn in the side of the government, who receives an unexpected call from Downing Street. And Thomas Docherty, Labour's deputy-shadow leader of the house, who goes to extraordinary lengths and makes unlikely alliances to guarantee time in the chamber for his party.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;c38baaa4ab838ff0edf2&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 22.5 (~1300Kbps)\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nVideo Resolution: 1024x576\nFrame Rate: 25 FPS\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 38 mins\nNumber of Parts: 4\nPart Size: 609 MB\nSource: HDTV\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b564fb96ee94a6f1513d9d7f7ee71a28366dbc01","amp;dn":"BBC.Inside.the.Commons.2of4.576p.HDTV.x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b564fb96ee94a6f1513d9d7f7ee71a28366dbc01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,100,251,150,238,148,166,241,81,61,157,127,126,231,26,40,54,109,188,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
