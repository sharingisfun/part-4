She spies a stranger coming up the long road to the farm and watches as her mother speaks to him. Before the afternoon is over, Laurel will witness a shocking crime. A crime that challenges everything she knows about her family and especially her mother, DorothyÃ¢â‚¬â€her vivacious, loving, nearly perfect mother.\nNow, fifty years later, Laurel is a successful and well-regarded actress living in London. The family is gathering at Greenacres farm for DorothyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ninetieth birthday. Realizing that this may be her last chance, Laurel searches for answers to the questions that still haunt her from that long-ago day, answers that can only be found in DorothyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past.\nDorothyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story takes the reader from preÃ¢â‚¬â€œWWII England through the blitz, to the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢60s and beyond. It is the secret history of three strangers from vastly different worldsÃ¢â‚¬â€Dorothy, Vivien, and JimmyÃ¢â‚¬â€who meet by chance in wartime London and whose lives are forever entwined. The Secret Keeper explores longings and dreams and the unexpected consequences they sometimes bring. It is an unforgettable story of lovers and friends, deception and passion that is toldÃ¢â‚¬â€in MortonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s signature styleÃ¢â‚¬â€against a backdrop of events that changed the world.\n\nFormats provided are:\n.ePub -\nCompatible with most eReaders including the Apple iPad.
