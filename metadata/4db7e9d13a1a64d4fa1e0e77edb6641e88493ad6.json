Enjoy!\n\n  --\n\n  Detailing Dante's early years and set against a contemporary backdrop,\n  DmC Devil May Cry will retain the stylish action, fluid combat and\n  self-assured protagonist that have defined the iconic series but\n  inject a more brutal and visceral edge.\n\n  The Dante of DmC is a young man who has no respect for authority or\n  society in general. Dante knows that he is not human, but also that he\n  is not like the demons that have tormented him throughout his life.\n  Caught between worlds, he feels like an outcast.\n\n  He is now discovering and coming to terms with what it means to be the\n  child of a demon and an angel. This split personality has a real impact\n  on gameplay with Dante being able to call upon angel and demon abilities\n  at will, transforming his Rebellion sword on the fly to dramatically\n  affect both combat and movement.\n\n  - Do it with style - Utilize Dante's Angel and Demon powers to chain\n    together ground-based and aerial combos to achieve the best style\n    ranking.\n\n  - Who is Dante? - Explore Dante's early years in a gripping narrative\n    featuring familiar faces from the series alongside all new characters.\n\n  - Unbridled action - The intense and iconic sword and gun based combat\n    returns with the addition of new weapons all designed to dispatch\n\tthe demonic spawn back to hell with style and panache.\n\n  - Retaining the Devil May Cry DNA - Capcom staff, including team members\n    from previous Devil May Cry titles, have been assigned to the project\n    from the outset to ensure DmC is a true addition to the Devil May Cry\n\tfranchise.\n\n  - Unrivalled production values - Ninja Theory will take advantage of the\n    latest performance capture technology to deliver a level of character\n    design, story-telling and cinematics that perfectly complements DmC's\n\thigh-octane combat.\n\n\n   1.
