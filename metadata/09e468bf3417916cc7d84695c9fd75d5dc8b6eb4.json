From bewitched pigs hell-bent on revenge to gruesome twentieth-century murders, American Witches reveals strange incidents of witchcraft that have long been swept under the rug as bizarre sidenotes to history.\r\n\r\nOn a tour through history thatâ€™s both whimsical and startling, weâ€™ll encounter seventeenth-century children flying around inside their New England home â€œlike geese.â€ Weâ€™ll meet a father-son team of pious Puritans who embarked on a mission that involved undressing ladies and overseeing hangings. And on the eve of the Civil War, weâ€™ll accompany a reporter as he dons a dress and goes searching for witches in New York Cityâ€™s most dangerous neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nEntertainingly readable and rich in amazing details often left out of todayâ€™s texts, American Witches casts a flickering torchlight into the dark corners of American history","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09e468bf3417916cc7d84695c9fd75d5dc8b6eb4","amp;dn":"American+Witches%3A+A+Broomstick+Tour+Through+Four+Centuries","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09e468bf3417916cc7d84695c9fd75d5dc8b6eb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,228,104,191,52,23,145,108,199,216,70,149,201,253,117,213,220,139,110,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
