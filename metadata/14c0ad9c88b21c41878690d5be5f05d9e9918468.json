When heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not scandalizing ladies in the bedchamber, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s outraging proper society with his scientific theories. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s desired, reviled, acclaimed, and despisedÃ¢â‚¬â€and he laughs through it all.\n\nViolet Waterfield, the widowed Countess of Cambury, on the other hand, is entirely respectable, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to stay that way. But Violet has a secret that is beyond ruinous, one that ties her irrevocably to EnglandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most infamous scoundrel: SebastianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theories arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t his. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re hers.\n\nSo when Sebastian threatens to dissolve their years-long conspiracy, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll do anything to save their partnership...even if it means opening her vulnerable heart to the rake who could destroy it for good.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14c0ad9c88b21c41878690d5be5f05d9e9918468","amp;dn":"The+Countess+Conspiracy+by+Courtney+Milan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14c0ad9c88b21c41878690d5be5f05d9e9918468","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,192,173,156,136,178,28,65,135,134,144,213,190,95,5,217,233,145,132,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
