What would happen if, instead of fighting difficult emotions, we accepted them? Over his decades of experience as a therapist and mindfulness meditation practitioner, Dr. Christopher Germer has learned a paradoxical lesson: We all want to avoid pain, but letting it in--and responding compassionately to our own imperfections, without judgment or self-blame--are essential steps on the path to healing. This wise and eloquent book illuminates the power of self-compassion and offers creative, scientifically grounded strategies for putting it into action. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll master practical techniques for living more fully in the present moment -- especially when hard-to-bear emotions arise -- and for being kind to yourself when you need it the most.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3d39ea6f599d3d9be102e6730079a4315459d7d","amp;dn":"The+Mindful+Path+to+Self-Compassion+by+C.K.+Germer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3d39ea6f599d3d9be102e6730079a4315459d7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,211,158,166,245,153,211,217,190,16,46,103,48,7,154,67,21,69,157,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
