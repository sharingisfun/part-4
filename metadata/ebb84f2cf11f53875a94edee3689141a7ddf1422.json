This invaluable handbook describes the historical background, construction materials, and basic structures and styles (Colonial, Federal, Victorian, Greek Revival, Romanesque, to name just a few). The book is divided first by building function (residential, commercial, etc.) and then by specific architectural period. Technical terms are clearly defined throughout a text illustrated with examples from a unique and ongoing series of drawings of historic buildings, which was begun in the 1930s as part of a W.
