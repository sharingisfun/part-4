Numerous researchers are working in developing different methods and techniques to help understand the behavior of very complex systems, from the brain activity with real importance in medicine to the turbulent flows with important applications in physics and engineering. This book presents an overview of some models, methods, and numerical computations that are useful for the applied research scientists and mathematicians, fluid tech engineers, and postgraduate students","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5946ccaadd4ec943b77b2598b5b5d4452e99b2a5","amp;dn":"Numerical+Simulation+-+From+Brain+Imaging+to+Turbulent+Flows","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5946ccaadd4ec943b77b2598b5b5d4452e99b2a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,70,204,170,221,78,201,67,183,123,37,152,181,181,212,69,46,153,178,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
