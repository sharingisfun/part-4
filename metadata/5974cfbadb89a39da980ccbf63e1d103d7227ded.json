David Carradine, Paul Smith, Brad Dourif\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100661/\r\n\r\n\r\nA criminal named Weasel robs and kills a young couple. When he goes to fence the stolen items he finds a baby in the backseat. The redneck couple that fence the material take the baby, name him Sonny Boy and raise him like an animal. They cut off his tongue and train him to kill their enemies and eat them. Screenwriter Graeme Whifler developed the story from a tale told to him by some bikers who lived in his neighbourhood. They told him the true account of a kidnapped child who was raised by an Indiana car thief who tortured the lad and trained him to be a killer. Because of the bizarre nature of the film and general failure at the box office many theatres pulled it after only a couple of days screenings.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 1024x440, 23.976 fps, 1999 Kbps, 01h43m12s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\n\r\nBRRip, MULTI Audio English with commentary tracks, optional English subtitles\r\n \nhttps://extraimago.com/images/2016/10/08/fc2f4ed4b612978eaf6e55f96592cb86.jpg \nhttps://extraimago.com/images/2016/10/08/805395b97848278fe133e51a50f83dbf.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5974cfbadb89a39da980ccbf63e1d103d7227ded","amp;dn":"Sonny+Boy+%5B1989+-+USA%5D+violent+crime+thriller","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5974cfbadb89a39da980ccbf63e1d103d7227ded","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,116,207,186,219,137,163,157,169,128,204,191,99,225,209,3,215,34,125,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
