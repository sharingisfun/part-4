The real-life maritime disaster would inspire Herman Melville's Moby-Dick. But that told only half the story. &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; reveals the encounter's harrowing aftermath, as the ship's surviving crew is pushed to their limits and forced to do the unthinkable to stay alive. Braving storms, starvation, panic and despair, the men will call into question their deepest beliefs, from the value of their lives to the morality of their trade, as their captain searches for direction on the open sea and his first mate still seeks to bring the great whale down.\r\n\r\ncast\r\n\r\nWill Townsend:...Elliot / Mr. Weenie (voice)\r\nMelissa Sturm:...Giselle (voice)\r\nTrevor Devall:...Shaw (voice)\r\nGarry Chalk:...Ed (voice)\r\nKathleen Barr:...Edna / Bobbie (voice)\r\nFrank Welker:...Animals' vocal effects (voice) (uncredited)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo:-\r\n\r\nFormat :mkv/AVC \r\nWriting Library :x264    \r\nDuration : 1h 24mn 45s \r\nBitrate :  3 543 Kbps  \r\nResolution=Width/Height : 1 920  x  1 080 pixels \r\nFrame Rate : 23.976 fps\r\n\r\nAudio:-\r\n\r\nFormat : AC-3 \r\nBitrate :  640 Kbps\r\nChannels : 6 Channels\r\nChannel Positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE \r\nSample Rate : 48KHz\r\nLanguage : English\r\n\r\nRelease info:-\r\n\r\nEncoded/Released By :tomcat12/ETRG \r\nTitle/Year : &quot;Open Season: Scared Silly&quot; / 2015\r\nFile Size : 2.53 GiB \r\nGenre : Action | Adventure | Biography | Drama | History | Thriller  \r\nSource : BluRay REMUX-FraMeSToR [Thanks]\r\nChapters : Yes \r\nSample : Yes \r\nSubtitles(VobSub):  English(SDH),English,English_Forced,Chinese[3].\r\nSubtitles(VobSub):  French,Indonesian,Korean,Spanish,(Latin),Thai.\r\nIMDB :    http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4938374/\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aNPj \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aNPT \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aNPN \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aNP2 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aNPw \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aNPa \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aNP8 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aNGV \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aNG6\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\nGreetz To: SaM |ozi|juggs|LRS|SureNdrA|Psix|Masta|MgB|Hand_of_Doom|BADASSMEDIA|FWOLF|Extratorrent|.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMake sure it is Genuine ETRG release @ ExtraTorrent.cc or from our Trusted Accounts elswhere","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bef2da0656b497469d7d7fe71359f62f8ea0e74d","amp;dn":"Open.Season.Scared.Silly.2015.1080p.BluRay.AC3.x264-ETRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bef2da0656b497469d7d7fe71359f62f8ea0e74d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,242,218,6,86,180,151,70,157,125,127,231,19,89,246,47,142,160,231,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
