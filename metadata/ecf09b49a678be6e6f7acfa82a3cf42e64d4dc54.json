So, it was time to once again turn Wings into a genuine band, adding Joe English and Jimmy McCulloch to the lineup and even letting the latter contribute a song. This faux-democracy isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t what signals that this is a band effort Ã¢â‚¬â€ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the attitude, construction, and pacing, which McCartney acknowledges as such, opening with an acoustic title track thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a salute to arena rock, leading to a genuine arena rock anthem, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rock Show.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ From there, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pretty much rocking pop tunes, paced with a couple of ballads and a little whimsy, all graced with a little of the production flair that distinguished Band on the Run. But where that record was clearly a studio creation and consciously elaborate, this is a straightforward affair where the sonic details are simply window dressing. McCartney doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really try anything new, but the songs are a little more varied than the uniform, glossy production would suggest; he dips into soft-shoe music hall shuffle on Ã¢â‚¬Å“You Gave Me the Answer,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ gets a little psychedelic with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Spirits of Ancient Egypt,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ kicks out a Ã¢â‚¬â„¢50s rock &amp; roll groove with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Magento and Titanium Man,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and unveils a typically sweet and lovely melody on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Listen to What the Man Said.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ These are slight shifts on an album that certainly feels like the overture for the arena rock tour that it was, which makes it one of McCartneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more consistent listens, even though itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s possible to scan the song listing after several listens and not recognize any song outside of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Listen to What the Man SaidÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the opening medley by title.\n\nCompared to other Super Deluxe Editions in the Paul McCartney Archive series, Venus &amp; Mars has a healthy amount of bonus material on its supplemental material, a fair indication of how Wings began its ascendency once guitarist Jimmy McCulloch joined Paul, Linda, and Laine after the release of Band on the Run. The band took about a year to gel, during which time they had a massive hit with Ã¢â‚¬Å“JuniorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Farm,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ an irresistible Steve Miller knock-off that didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it to Venus &amp; Mars, and Paul released the oddball, old-timey one-off Country Hams single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Walking in the Park with EloiseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½/Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Bridge on the River Suite.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ These singles Ã¢â‚¬â€ including Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sally G,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the amiably lazy country stroll on the flip of Ã¢â‚¬Å“JuniorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s FarmÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ are all on the 14-track bonus disc to the various 2014 expanded editions of Venus &amp; Mars, and there are other songs that popped up on B-sides over the next decade: the instrumental mini-suite Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lunch Box/Odd Sox,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which sounds like Paul never bothered to get around to writing a vocal melody, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“My Carnival,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a genial interpolation of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Going to New OrleansÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ inspired by the city where V&amp;M was completed. A version of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Going to New OrleansÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is also here (Ã¢â‚¬Å“My CarnivalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is added as a subtitle, just to make the connection clear) among the other odds and ends. Among the other highlights are a thrillingly dense Ã¢â‚¬Å“SoilyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from One Hand Clapping; McCartney demos for Ã¢â‚¬Å“LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“4th of July,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ tunes he gave to Peggy Lee and John Christie, respectively; an early version of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rock ShowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and a single edit of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Letting Go.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ With such a wide variety of source material, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s little wonder that this plays more like a clearing house rather than a cohesive album but its unkemptness is its appeal: by hearing Wings try so many different sounds, they truly do seem like a band with their own identity separate from McCartney, which was the whole point of Venus &amp; Mars in the first place.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecf09b49a678be6e6f7acfa82a3cf42e64d4dc54","amp;dn":"Paul+McCartney+%26amp%3B+Wings+-+Venus+and+Mars+%5BDeluxe+Edition%5D+%2820","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecf09b49a678be6e6f7acfa82a3cf42e64d4dc54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,240,155,73,166,120,190,110,111,122,207,168,42,60,244,46,100,212,220,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
