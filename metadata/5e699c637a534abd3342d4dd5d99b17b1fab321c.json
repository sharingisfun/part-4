As Brockton and his assistant Miranda dig deeper, they uncover warning signs of a deadly eruption of hatred and violence.\r\nBut the shocking case is only the beginning of Brocktonâ€™s trials. Mid-case, the unthinkable happens: The deadliest criminal Brockton has ever foiledâ€”the sadistic serial killer Nick Satterfieldâ€”escapes from prison, bent on vengeance.\r\nBut simply killing Brockton isnâ€™t enough. Satterfield wants to make him suffer first, by destroying everything he holds dear: Brocktonâ€™s son, daughter-in-law, grandsons; even Miranda, his longtime graduate assistant, now on the verge of completing her Ph.D. and launching a forensic career of her own.\r\nThe dangers from all directions force Brockton to question two things on which heâ€™s based his entire careerâ€”the justice system, and the quality of mercyâ€”and to wonder: can the two co-exist?\r\nIf not, which will Brockton choose in his ultimate moment of truth?\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e699c637a534abd3342d4dd5d99b17b1fab321c","amp;dn":"Without+Mercy+-+Jefferson+Bass+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e699c637a534abd3342d4dd5d99b17b1fab321c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,105,156,99,122,83,74,189,51,66,212,221,93,153,177,123,31,171,50,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
