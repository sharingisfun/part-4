These five people have been friends since they were little kids. They all grew up together and are neighbors to this day. Their families are also very close to each other. They always hang around Taek's room and spend time together.\r\n\r\nDuk-Sunâ€™s family is poor and they live in a semi-basement house. Duk-Sun's father Dong-Il (Sung Dong-Il) lost money due to guaranteeing someone else's debt. Nevertheless, Duk-Sun has a bright personality and enjoys singing and dancing. She always gets into fights with her older sister Bo-Ra (Ryoo Hye-Young).\r\n\r\nJung-Hwanâ€™s family became rich overnight. Jung-Hwan is crazy about soccer.\r\n\r\nSun-Woo is a model student at school, good son and good brother at home. Sun-Wooâ€™s mother has raised Sun-Woo and his younger sister alone after Sun-Wooâ€™s father passed away.\r\n\r\nDong-Ryong likes dancing and hanging out with his 4 friends. He gives up going to a university due to his poor academic score.\r\n\r\nTaek is a famous go player known as God. Since he dropped out of school, Duk-Sun, Jung-Hwan, Sun-Woo and Dong-Ryong are his only friends.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\nReply 1988&quot; takes over the tvN Fri &amp; Sat 19:50 time slot previously occupied by &quot;Second Time Twenty Years Oldâ€ and will be followed by &quot;Signal&quot; on January 22, 2016.\r\nPremise for the drama series is inspired by MBC drama series &quot;Three Families Under One Roofâ€ (&quot;Hanjiboong Segajok&quot;) which aired from November 9, 1986 through November 13 1994.\r\nFirst script reading took place in the afternoon on July 8, 2015 at CJ E&amp;M CENTER in Sangamdong, Seoul.\r\nFilming began July 31, 2015 at a drama set in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. \r\nEp. 17 and ep. 18 of &quot;Reply 1988&quot; will not air on January 1, 2016 and January 2, 2016 as originally planned. Instead, ep.17 and ep.18 will air January 8, 2016 and January 9, 2016. The delay is due to a tight filming and editing schedule with the holidays.\r\nStory and characters are not related to prior series.\r\nRelated titles:\r\nReply 1997 | Eungdabhara 1997 (tvN / 2012)\r\nReply 1994 | Eungdabhara 1994 (tvN / 2013)\r\nReply 1988 | Eungdabhara 1988 (tvN / 2015)\r\n\r\nHard-subbed Complete...\r\nPlease seed and enjoy!\r\nHappy watching","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab79a339bb2b007ad75e6a0b961a2193d65e8b64","amp;dn":"Reply+1988+%28Korean+Drama%29+%5BJseitchenC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab79a339bb2b007ad75e6a0b961a2193d65e8b64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,121,163,57,187,43,0,122,215,94,106,11,150,26,33,147,214,94,139,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
