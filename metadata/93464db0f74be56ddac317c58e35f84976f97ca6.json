Mr. Enamait offers hard work, sweat &amp; suffering through which you can achieve more. I did pass the black belt test (5.5 hours, full contact fighting, wind sprints all day, obstacle courses, non-stop abuse) on my feet thanks to this book. I haven't trained as intensly since then, but I keep this book on hand for refreshers on different excerices, variety, diet tips, etc.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93464db0f74be56ddac317c58e35f84976f97ca6","amp;dn":"The+Underground+Guide+To+Warrior+Fitness%3A+High+Performance+Bodyw","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93464db0f74be56ddac317c58e35f84976f97ca6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,70,77,176,247,75,229,109,218,195,23,197,142,53,248,73,118,249,124,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
