The edgy funnyman brandished his unique style of streetsmart comedy to skewer everything from car commercials to the KKK, blending sketches, parodies, standup, and musical guest performances into a hilarious sendup of modern American life. Though the show was cancelled after only two seasons, Chappelle did record a handful of skits for a possible third season, presented here as a collection of &quot;lost episodes.&quot;\n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 68 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74bd8a216b9ec5832c81cb2005deab3f68c8fd4e","amp;dn":"Chappelle%5C%27s+Show%3A+The+Lost+Episodes%282003%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74bd8a216b9ec5832c81cb2005deab3f68c8fd4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,189,138,33,107,158,197,131,44,129,203,32,5,222,171,63,104,200,253,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
