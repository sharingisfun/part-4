Shake!&quot; had been played as early as 2005. More recently, songs such as &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot;, &quot;Alright&quot;, &quot;Obsession&quot;, &quot;Turnaround&quot; and &quot;I Won't Let You Down&quot; were played at gigs and festivals throughout 2007 and early 2008.\n\nThe album was delayed in recording after Billy Lunn was diagnosed with nodules in his vocal cords, which almost resulted in the frontman losing his voice. This led to the naming of the album All or Nothing. The effort was recorded in two periods at Conway Studios during 2007 by Butch Vig, who has produced albums for Nirvana (Nevermind), Jimmy Eat World (Chase This Light) and The Smashing Pumpkins (Gish and Siamese Dream).\n\nThe album was leaked onto the internet on June 23, 2008.\n\nThe album entered the UK album charts at number 17 on July 6, after being released on June 30, 2008.\n\nThe song &quot;Kalifornia&quot; is credited to being featured on the video game Midnight Club: Los Angeles.\n\nThe song &quot;I Won't Let You Down&quot; is featured on the video game Colin McRae: Dirt 2.\n\nThe Subways performed the song &quot;Shake! Shake!&quot; as well playing themselves in a guest appearance in the episode &quot;Golden Lady&quot; of the TV series FM.\n\n\nEste CD tambien lo puedes encontrar en:\nThis CD also you can find it at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7104150/Geloso_MP3_Albums_Compilation_%28Alternative_Rock%29_-_Vol._1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7104150/Geloso_MP3_Albums_Compilation_%28Alternative_Rock%29_-_Vol._1&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69e3ffaf43004df1236c037ca09eec5e6fb8bf38","amp;dn":"The+Subways+-+%282008%29+All+Or+Nothing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69e3ffaf43004df1236c037ca09eec5e6fb8bf38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,227,255,175,67,0,77,241,35,108,3,124,160,158,236,94,111,184,191,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
