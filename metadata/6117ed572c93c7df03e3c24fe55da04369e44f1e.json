Clearer pictures, more pictures, more realistic pictures, structures broken up in ways that make sense and shown from every angle...includes clinical correlations and summary charts of innervations and actions. That's about all there is to it. Just buy it. Thank you Thieme!!! Ok, now back to studying...\n\nIn my opinion this book surpasses them all. It's the artwork. The artist has found the perfect balance of detail and clarity. Some of these illustrations have to be seen to be believed.... The pearls of clinical information are very good and these add significance to the information and make it easier to remember. Easier to remember is key.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6117ed572c93c7df03e3c24fe55da04369e44f1e","amp;dn":"Atlas+of+Anatomy+%2C+2E-+Gilroy+%5BEpub%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6117ed572c93c7df03e3c24fe55da04369e44f1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,23,237,87,44,147,199,223,3,227,194,79,229,93,160,67,105,228,79,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
