So if there's enything i'm doing wrong, \nplease let me know =)\n\nIt's PAL...Is there anything else you need to know?? :P\n\nHappy playing\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nAfter being humiliated yet again by Crash Bandicoot at the end of Crash Twinsanity, \nCortex returns to his evil scheming in his dilapidated Iceberg Lair. He stumbles \nacross a newspaper article regarding the closure of Ebeneezer Von Clutch's condemned \nracing arena. He hatches a sinister plan to challenge Crash to a seemingly friendly \nrace competition... with plans of crushing the hapless bandicoot under the ruins of \nthe hazardous racetrack! Will the evil doctor's plans be the end of our furry hero?\nIn Crash Tag Team Racing, players can &quot;clash&quot; their car with an opponent's mid-race \nto make a super-car equipped with a powerful turret gun. When clashed, players can \neither get behind the wheel and drive, or fire an onboard weapon. Each character \nhas his or her own uniquely deadly 360ÃƒÅ¡ rotating turret. Players can continue the \naction out of the car where they can explore the entire world on foot and collect \nupgrades for their cars and unlock bonus tracks.\n\n\nLink to watch: http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/crash-tag-team-racing/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5fa8972d662eaa56bab46bbffa0b50b85290718","amp;dn":"Crash+Bandicoot+-+Tag+Team+Racing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5fa8972d662eaa56bab46bbffa0b50b85290718","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,250,137,114,214,98,234,165,107,171,70,187,255,160,181,11,133,41,7,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
