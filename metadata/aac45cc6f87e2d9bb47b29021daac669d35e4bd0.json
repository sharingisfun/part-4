The CORPUS is dedicated to the painted works of Rembrandt. It aims to isolate RembrandtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own works from the great volume of Rembrandt-like paintings, produced by his many pupils and followers, sometimes with the involvement of the master himself. The fourth volume (Springer 2005) was dedicated to RembrandtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s self-portraits. This fifth volume is about the small-scale history and genre paintings. The so-called Ã¢â‚¬ËœhistoriesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (paintings, etchings and drawings with biblical or mythological scenes) were considered to be the most challenging assignments for an artist. All kinds of artistic insights and skills Ã¢â‚¬â€œ known in RembrandtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time as the basic aspects of the art of painting - played a role in the creation of this kind of work, especially in the history paintings. Systematic research into this hitherto little known area has revealed a rich, and often fresh understanding of RembrandtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own way of thinking about these basic aspects, which makes the present volume a unique and innovative contribution to the history of art. A detailed comparison of RembrandtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own work with that of his pupils has furthermore provided a detailed access to RembrandtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own criteria regarding artistic quality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aac45cc6f87e2d9bb47b29021daac669d35e4bd0","amp;dn":"A+Corpus+of+Rembrandt+Paintings+V+-+Small-Scale+History+Painting","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aac45cc6f87e2d9bb47b29021daac669d35e4bd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,196,92,198,248,126,45,155,180,123,41,2,29,170,198,105,211,94,75,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
