Now Iv&amp;#039;e packed it into an installer and \nincluded more songs. I also switched from DWI to StepMania. It may take a little while longer to load but it has more \nof that DDr feel and more options. Please check back as I believe in September 2008 DDRX comes out and i&amp;#039;ll have the \ndance files as soon as I can get them. I covered basics but there are many custom dance files out there.\n\nFor more simulator files (tracks) visit:\nwww.bemanistyle.com\nwww.stepmania.com\n\nFor more Themes, Noteskins, characters, and Announcers visit:\nwww.stepmaniathings.com\n\nThanks to...\nwww.ddruk.com\nwww.bemanistyle.com\nwww.stepmania.com\n\nCheck out http://www.mymybox.com/ for dance pads for all platforms.\nCheck out http://www.flashflashrevolution.com/ for online flash version of DDR.\n\nInstructions:\nInstall StepMania-3.9\nExtract Songs.rar to :/Program Files/StepMania/Songs\nPlace contents of Courses to :/Program Files/StepMania/Courses and run each smzip file to install\nPlace contents of Themes to :/Program Files/StepMania/Themes and run each smzip file to install\nPlay\n \nAlbum List\n\nBANTU Originals\nBemani\nDance Dance Revolution &amp; Dancing Stage SuperNOVA -Arcade-\nDance Dance Revolution 1.5\nDance Dance Revolution 2nd Append -Club v1-\nDance Dance Revolution 2nd Append -Club v2-\nDance Dance Revolution 2nd Link Version\nDance Dance Revolution 2nd Mix\nDance Dance Revolution 3rd Korean v1\nDance Dance Revolution 3rd Korean v2\nDance Dance Revolution 3rd Mix\nDance Dance Revolution 3rd Mix -Asian Version-\nDance Dance Revolution 3rd Mix Plus\nDance Dance Revolution 4th Mix\nDance Dance Revolution 4th Mix Plus\nDance Dance Revolution 5th Mix\nDance Dance Revolution 6th Mix -Max-\nDance Dance Revolution 7th Mix -Max2-\nDance Dance Revolution 8th Mix -Extreme-\nDance Dance Revolution Disney Dancing Museum\nDance Dance Revolution Edit Data -3rd Mix-\nDance Dance Revolution Edit Data -5th mix- \nDance Dance Revolution Edit Data -Extra Mix-\nDance Dance Revolution Extra Mix - Challenge Mods-\nDance Dance Revolution Extreme 2\nDance Dance Revolution Festival\nDance Dance Revolution Festival -Mission Mode-\nDance Dance Revolution GB 1\nDance Dance Revolution GB 2\nDance Dance Revolution GB \nDance Dance Revolution GB Oha Super Kids Station\nDance Dance Revolution Konamix\nDance Dance Revolution Oha super Kids Station\nDance Dance Revolution Party Collection\nDance Dance Revolution PC\nDance Dance Revolution PSX 2nd Append - club v2-\nDance Dance Revolution PSX 2nd ReMix\nDance Dance Revolution PSX 3rd Mix\nDance Dance Revolution PSX 4th Mix\nDance Dance Revolution PSX 4th Mix -Challenge Mode-\nDance Dance Revolution PSX 5th Mix\nDance Dance Revolution PSX 6th Mix -Max JP-\nDance Dance Revolution PSX 7th Mix -Max2 JP-\nDance Dance Revolution PSX 8th Mix -Extreme JP-\nDance Dance Revolution PSX -Extreme USA-\nDance Dance Revolution PSX -Extreme USA Mission Mode-\nDance Dance Revolution PSX -Max2 USA-\nDance Dance Revolution PSX -Max USA-\nDance Dance Revolution PSX -USA-\nDance Dance Revolution Solo 2000\nDance Dance Revolution Solo Bass Mix\nDance Dance Revolution Strike\nDance Dance Revolution Supernova PSX -USA-\nDance Dance Revolution Tokimeki Mix\nDance Dance Revolution Ultramix 2\nDance Dance Revolution Ultramix 3\nDance Dance Revolution with Mario\nDancing Stage 1.5\nDancing Stage Euromix 1\nDancing Stage Euromix 2\nDancing Stage feat.
