The film is based on the 1981 (revised 1987) book of the same name written by Vito Russo, and on previous lecture and film clip presentations given in person by Russo 1972ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“82.\n\nRusso researched the history of how motion pictures, especially Hollywood films, had portrayed gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender characters. It was given a limited release in select theatres, including the Castro Theatre in San Francisco in April 1996, and then shown on cable channel HBO.\n\nThe documentary interviews various men and women connected to the Hollywood industry to comment on various film clips and their own personal experiences with the treatment of LGBT characters in film. From the sissy characters, to the censorship of the Hollywood Production Code, the coded gay characters and cruel stereotypes to the changes made in the early 1990s.\n\nVito Russo wanted his book to be transformed into a documentary film and helped out on the project until he died in 1990. Some critics of the documentary noted that it was less political than the book and ended on a more positive note. However, Russo had wanted the documentary to be entertaining and to reflect the positive changes that had occurred up to 1990.\n\nRusso approached Epstein about making a film version of The Celluloid Closet and even wrote a proposal for the film version in 1986. But it wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t until Russo died in 1990 that Epstein and Friedman gained any traction on the project. After his death, Channel 4 in England approached the filmmakers about the film, and offered development funding in order to write a treatment, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œand most importantly to determine if it would even be possible to obtain the film clips from studios.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nAfter developing the project for years, fundraising remained the biggest obstacle. Lily Tomlin, the actress and comedian who would narrate the film, launched a direct mail fundraising campaign in Vito RussoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s honor. She also headlined a benefit at the Castro Theatre, which featured Robin Williams, Harvey Fierstein, and drag star Lypsinka. Individuals such as Hollywood producer Steve Tisch, James Hormel, and Hugh Hefner offered ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsignificant supportÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the filmmakers also began to receive foundation funding from the Paul Robeson Fund, the California Council for the Humanities, and the Chicago Resource Center.[4]\n\nEuropean television again played an important role in funding the project, when ZDF/arte signed on, but it wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t until the filmmakers reached out to HBO that they were able to begin production. In May 1994, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLily Tomlin contacted Michael Fuchs, chairman of HBO, on behalf of the project. Epstein, Friedman, Tomlin, and Rosenman flew to New York for a meeting with Fuchs and HBO Vice President Sheila Nevins. At that meeting, HBO committed to supply the remainder of the budget.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20e20d7714a1ca3af3c8eb8a871dea5e157f626a","amp;dn":"The+Celluloid+Closet+%5B1995%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20e20d7714a1ca3af3c8eb8a871dea5e157f626a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,226,13,119,20,161,202,58,243,200,235,138,135,29,234,94,21,127,98,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
