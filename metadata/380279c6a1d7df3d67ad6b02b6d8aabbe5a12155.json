Now he's trying to get \r\nhis life in order. He's living with his kid sister to save money. He's taking \r\nmedication to wean himself off the booze. Most important, he's trying to win \r\nback the trust of his estranged wife, a medical examiner, and maintain a \r\nloving relationship with his two young children. To make money while waiting \r\nfor reinstatement, he takes a job as a night watchman at a department store \r\ngutted by fire. That was a mistake. He is soon tormented by the same \r\nsupernatural mirrors that plagued his predecessor. The images in these \r\nmirrors do not reflect reality as we know it. The images will stare back at \r\nyou, but remain in the mirror when you walk away. The images will even try \r\nto kill you. Soon, Ben Carson finds that the mirrors' demons follow him \r\neverywhere in every reflective surface. They're willing to harass him and \r\nhis family until they get what they want. Ben's job is to find out exactly \r\nwhat that is.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Kiefer Sutherland.\r\n=&gt;-Amy Smart.\r\n=&gt;-Paula Patton.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Alexandre Aja.\r\n\r\nMirrors 2 2010.\r\nWhile driving on the road with his fiancee Kayla, Max Matheson has a serious \r\ncar accident and they both die.
