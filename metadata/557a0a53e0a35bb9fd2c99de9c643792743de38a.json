What?s more, Ferguson reveals financial history as the essential backstory behind all history, arguing that the evolution of credit and debt was as important as any technological innovation in the rise of civilization. As Ferguson traces the crisis from ancient Egypt?s Memphis to today?s Chongqing, he offers bold and compelling new insights into the rise? and fall?of not just money but Western power as well.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:557a0a53e0a35bb9fd2c99de9c643792743de38a","amp;dn":"The+Ascent+of+Money+Niall+Ferguson+PDF+%5BQwerty80%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"557a0a53e0a35bb9fd2c99de9c643792743de38a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,122,10,83,224,163,91,185,253,44,153,222,156,100,55,146,116,61,227,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
